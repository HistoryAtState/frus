                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series Foreign Relations of the
                    United States has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and
                    diplomacy of the United States. Historians in the Office of the Historian
                    collect, arrange, and annotate the principal documents comprising the record of
                    American foreign policy. The standards for the preparation of the series and the
                    general deadlines for its publication are established by the Foreign Relations
                    of the United States statute of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). Volumes
                    in the Foreign Relations series are published when all the necessary editing,
                    declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
                    Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of
                    the relevant Departmental units. The volume also includes records from the
                    Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, the
                    editor made extensive use of the Presidential and other papers at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library in Austin, Texas.
                    Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The

                    of Administration, Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices
                    in other agencies or governments, carried out the declassification of the
                    selected documents.</p>

                </p>
                <p>U.S. policy toward China during President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson's</persName> administration remained essentially what it had been
                    during the Kennedy and Eisenhower administrations—non-recognition of the
                    People's Republic of China (P.R.C.), support for Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist
                    government and its possession of China's seat in the United Nations, and a ban
                    on trade and travel to the P.R.C.—but the consensus that had once supported U.S.
                    policy was eroding. President <persName>Johnson</persName> and Secretary of
                    State Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, preoccupied with Vietnam,
                    resisted changes in U.S. policy, but even <persName>Johnson</persName> privately
                    acknowledged that the United States would eventually have to recognize the
                    P.R.C. (2)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">The First Chinese Nuclear Explosion</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The People' Republic of China exploded its first nuclear device on October 16,
                    1964. The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration viewed the long
                    anticipated Chinese entry into the nuclear club as a challenge to its efforts to
                    contain Chinese influence and prevent Chinese aggression in Asia. U.S. analysts
                    who examined the subject in detail concluded, however, that the Chinese would
                    have neither the weapons nor the delivery systems to be a serious threat to the
                    United States and its allies for the foreseeable future; the psychological
                    impact of the first P.R.C. nuclear explosion would be greater than its military
                    significance. (14, 25, 30, 43)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Johnson</persName> administration policymakers rejected the
                    possibility of preemptive military action against Chinese nuclear facilities.
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Special Assistant to the
                    President for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                        Bundy</persName> tried to sound out Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin on the
                    possibility of U.S.-Soviet discussion on the significance of China's becoming a
                    nuclear power. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> refused to be
                    drawn into discussion, however; he told <persName>Bundy</persName> that Chinese
                    nuclear weapons would have no importance against the Soviet Union or the United
                    States. (49, 54, 61)</p>
                <p>The administration tried to blunt the psychological impact of the Chinese
                    explosion by eliminating the element of surprise from the Chinese announcement
                    and assuring the U.S. public and foreign leaders that it did not significantly
                    change the power equation. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated
                    publicly on September 29 that a Chinese nuclear explosion might be imminent.
                    Preliminary reports of a Chinese test reached the White House on October 16, as
                    Johnson and his top advisers were meeting to discuss Khrushchev's fall from
                    power. <persName>Johnson</persName> announced the explosion to the press later
                    the same day. In the next few days, <persName>Johnson</persName> attempted to
                    reassure the public that the events in China and the Soviet Union did not pose a
                    major threat, and U.S. emissaries tried to reassure Chiang Kai-shek and other
                    Asian leaders of continuing U.S. support. (57–60, 62)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">The Chinese Representation Issue</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The United States was under growing international pressure to shift its position
                    on the Chinese representation issue to permit <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> entry into the United Nations. The <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration was divided. In September 1964, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> sent a personal message to all U.S. ambassadors urging them
                    to do everything possible to maintain the Nationalists' international position.
                    Representative to the United Nations <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai E.
                        Stevenson</persName>, however, thought the United States should prepare to
                    modify its policy. The Canadian Government, which had previously supported the
                    United States on this issue, was pressing for a change to a two-China
                    arrangement. (47, 63, 65, 68, 72)</p>
                <p>At a White House meeting in November 1964, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> told the President that the U.S. position was badly
                    eroded and in another year would be irretrievable. He thought the best solution
                    was to begin to shift toward a two-China policy, which the Communists would not
                    accept anyway. <persName>Bundy</persName> reminded <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    that the Chinese seat on the Security Council was also at stake. President
                    Kennedy had told Chiang he would use the veto if necessary to keep the
                    Communists out, but <persName>Bundy</persName> questioned whether the United
                    States would want to do this year after year. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> declared that if the United States appeared to falter
                    before the Soviets and Chinese Communists, it would be interpreted as a reward
                    and would increase the chances of Communist military aggression.
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> said he was impressed by Rusk's remarks. He
                    alluded to the possibility of Congressional opposition to a policy change, but
                    he declared that what gave him pause was Rusk's statement that a change “would
                    be a pay-off for the Soviet and Chicom hard line.” <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> argued that that he and others had long felt that the
                    Chinese Communists could best be managed by bringing them into the community of
                    nations. <persName>Johnson</persName> declared that he did not pay the
                    foreigners at the United Nations to advise him on foreign policy, but that he
                    did pay <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and was inclined to listen to
                    him. (66)</p>
                <p>The Chinese representation issue was not debated by the General Assembly in 1964,
                    but the vote in 1965 was closer than ever before. There was a tie vote on a
                    resolution to admit the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and expel the
                    Nationalists, and a resolution declaring Chinese representation an important
                    question requiring a two-thirds majority passed by only seven votes. U.S.
                    representatives at the United Nations feared that the U.S. strategy of requiring
                    a two-thirds majority for a change in Chinese representation was no longer
                    viable. They anticipated a major battle at the next General Assembly. (143)</p>
                <p>In April 1966, Stevenson's successor at the United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur J. Goldberg</persName>, urged
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> to adopt new tactics. He proposed encouraging
                    the Canadians to introduce a “successor state" resolution in the General
                    Assembly, recognizing both the Communists and the Nationalists as having U.N.
                    membership. He expected the Communists to reject this arrangement and would
                    therefore bear the responsibility for their continued absence from the United
                    Nations. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> endorsed the proposal, but
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> hesitated. He agreed, however, that Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">Walter P. McConaughy</persName>, newly arrived
                    in Taipei, should sound out Chiang Kai-shek on the subject, which <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> could take up with him when he visited
                    Taipei in July. (144–145, 149–150, 154)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> broached the subject with
                    Chiang Kai-shek on July 1, telling him that the old tactics on the Chinese
                    representation issue were no longer viable and that new tactics were necessary.
                    Chiang declared that any two-China resolution would force Nationalist withdrawal
                    from the United Nations; no compromise with a rebel regime was possible. When
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> made a similar approach,
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> told him that he had already given his views to
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName>. After <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> returned to Washington, the proposed policy
                    shift was shelved. (162–163, 170) As the time for the General Assembly grew
                    closer, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> renewed his argument for
                    a new approach, but <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> still opposed it.
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> again supported <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>; after a luncheon meeting between the President and his top
                    advisers, U.S. policy remained unchanged. (179, 182–184, 185)</p>
                <p>Early in November, the Canadians gave the Department of State a proposed
                    resolution requesting the General Assembly President to explore possibilities
                    for a solution of the Chinese representation issue. The resolution's preamble
                    suggested an interim arrangement with both Chinese governments seated in the
                    General Assembly and with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in the
                    Security Council. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and his advisers
                    concluded that the best way to counter this was to support a proposal by Italy
                    and Belgium to establish a study committee to examine the issue. This proposal,
                    they realized, would almost certainly eventuate in a two-China recommendation,
                    but they considered it preferable to the Canadian draft resolution, which
                    prejudged the outcome. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> discussed
                    the situation with the President at the LBJ Ranch, and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pressed Canadian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Lester Pearson</persName> to drop the Canadian draft and
                    instead support a study committee resolution. (194, 197, 200–202)</p>
                <p>Nationalist officials were indignant when <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> told them the United States found it necessary to
                    support a study committee resolution. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei Tao-ming</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> that a study committee resolution would be even worse
                    than a two-China resolution. If such a resolution were adopted, the Nationalists
                    would have to consider withdrawal from the United Nations. A few days later,
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> cabled from Taipei that
                    a decision had been taken at the highest level to withdraw from the United
                    Nations if a study committee resolution passed. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> instructed <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> to express Rusk's surprise and dismay at this
                    decision to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, but
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> would not budge. (204, 209–210, 212–213)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> concluded that it was time for the
                    President to weigh in. On November 26, <persName>Johnson</persName> sent a
                    letter to <persName>Chiang</persName> declaring that withdrawal from the United
                    Nations by the Nationalists would be a “tragedy" for them and the United States.
                    He told <persName>Chiang</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> would visit Taipei the following month and urged him not to
                    take any irrevocable steps until then. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reiterated the U.S. position in a letter to Foreign
                    Minister <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName>. He reminded Wei that in 1964
                    he had reaffirmed Kennedy's 1961 assurance that the United States would use the
                    veto if necessary to keep the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> out of the
                    Security Council, but he noted that if the Nationalists withdrew, there would
                    probably be no opportunity to use the veto. On November 29, the Acting Foreign
                    Minister told <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> that the
                    Nationalists would not withdraw if the study committee resolution passed but
                    would merely walk out temporarily. (217–219)</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, however, Communist Party Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao
                        Zedong</persName> had unleashed the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards were
                    on the march in China, and in the face of the growing turmoil, support for a
                    change in Chinese U.N. representation diminished. On November 29, the General
                    Assembly defeated a resolution to admit the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    and expel the Nationalists by an 11-vote margin, adopted the important question
                    resolution by 18 votes, and defeated the study committee resolution by an even
                    wider margin. (220) The administration was never forced to take publicly the
                    position it had with so much difficulty persuaded the Nationalists to accept.
                    Because of the disorder on the mainland, the Chinese representation issue did
                    not pose a major problem for the administration during its last two years.</p>
                <p>The United States and the People's Republic of China There were pressures both
                    inside and outside the administration for modifications of other aspects of U.S.
                    policy toward China. In June 1965, after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a
                    House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee urged steps to permit some direct
                    contacts with the China mainland, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern
                    Affairs William P. <persName>Bundy</persName> proposed modifying U.S. travel
                    restrictions to permit travel to the mainland by scholars and representatives of
                    humanitarian organizations. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> rejected
                    this proposal but endorsed an initiative to permit travel to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> by physicians and public health specialists, a
                    group that was unlikely to request such access in large numbers.
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> initially rejected even this modest step but
                    authorized it two months later. (87, 89–90, 94, 98, 112)</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, U.S. involvement in the Vietnam conflict heightened the concern of
                    U.S. policymakers at what they perceived as an aggressive Chinese foreign
                    policy. At an August 1965 meeting between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName>, the emphasis was on containment. The central
                    question, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> declared, was how to
                    persuade the Chinese leaders that they were on the wrong track. Such steps as
                    admitting China to the United Nations would send exactly the wrong message. It
                    had required a trillion dollars in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense
                    budgets to stop the Russians in Europe, he said, and it would require a major
                    decision by the United States and its allies to stop the Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed, adding that the U.S.
                    government had not really faced the problem of generating sufficient power to
                    “convince the Chinese of their error.” (99) A 1966 State-Defense study defined
                    Chinese objectives as regional hegemony and world revolution. The three options
                    for dealing with the Chinese which it laid out were disengagement, containment,
                    and showdown. The middle option was recommended. (161)</p>
                <p>Congressional hearings on U.S. policy toward China early in 1966 increased
                    pressure for a more flexible policy. The witnesses included a number of
                    prominent academic specialists on China, who provided an extensive critique of
                    U.S. policy. The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration responded by taking
                    up one of the themes sounded in the hearings by critics who urged a policy of
                    containment without isolation. (129, 131, 135, 136) In a major speech on U.S.
                    policy in Asia in July 1966, President <persName>Johnson</persName> declared
                    that “reconciliation between nations that now call themselves enemies" was an
                    essential component of peace and that “the greatest force for opening closed
                    minds and closed societies is the free flow of ideas and people and goods.”
                    (168) The change was rhetorical rather than substantive, but it was enough to
                    raise the anxiety level in Taipei. (138, 142)</p>

                    <hi rend="strong">The Cultural Revolution</hi>
                </p>
                <p>U.S. policymakers viewed the outbreak of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966
                    with fascination and some perplexity. With only limited information available,
                    U.S. analysts were uncertain of the meaning of the events they could observe.
                        <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Alfred L. Jenkins</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff commented that there was “something
                    awesome in the spectacle of the oldest civilization on earth methodically
                    digging up its roots to the tune of raucous, uncivilized ballyhoo and bedlam.”
                    (184) Consul General in Hong Kong <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Edward E.
                        Rice</persName> commented that no developments in China in recent years had
                    been at once so important and so clouded in obscurity. Was it an ideological
                    purge, a policy dispute, a power struggle? It was all three, he concluded. (160)
                    A <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> appraisal presented the crisis as the last
                    stand of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, who was seeking
                    to suppress forces for change inside the Communist party. It commented,
                        “<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is worried about his revolution
                    for it is clearly failing.” (172)</p>
                <p>It is evident from reports sent to President <persName>Johnson</persName> that he
                    was particularly interested in developments in China because of their possible
                    impact on the situation in Vietnam. Chaos in China might reduce Chinese support
                    for North Vietnam; conversely, an out-of-control China might lash out in
                    Southeast Asia. Bundy's successor, Special Assistant to the President <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> frequently sent summary reports and
                    occasionally sent lengthy analyses of the Chinese situation to the President. He
                    forwarded an August 1966 analysis from Hong Kong to
                    <persName>Johnson</persName>, with a brief summary noting that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> had chosen <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Biao</persName> (Lin Piao) as his successor and that if Lin could
                    consolidate his position, he was “bad news.” (176) He sent another with the
                    optimistic comment, “I cannot help believing that this wild trouble in China may
                    make it easier for Hanoi to get out of the war.” (188)</p>
                <p>As the turmoil in China reached new heights at the beginning of 1967,
                        <persName>Rostow</persName> told <persName>Johnson</persName> that civil war
                    had become a “distinct possibility" and sent him a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> analysis comparing the situation to another period of Chinese
                    disunity which was a precursor of dynastic change. (229, 232) A panel of
                    academic experts that met at the Department of State in February agreed that no
                    one could foresee what China would be like in a year's time. (236) A few weeks
                    later, however, Jenkins reported that Chinese Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZE1">Zhou Enlai</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>)
                    had succeeded in gaining the support of the Chinese military for more moderate
                    policies to preserve unity and restore the damaged economy.
                        <persName>Rostow</persName> forwarded the memorandum to
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> with a note commenting that the Chinese had
                    “stared at the possibility of famine" and had drawn back. (244)</p>
                <p>In the following months, reports to <persName>Johnson</persName> noted growing
                    Army influence amid continuing disorder. (253, 265, 267, 269, 275, 279) A
                    Department of State analysis which <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                    sent to <persName>Johnson</persName> in early 1968 observed that the Cultural
                    Revolution had succeeded in crushing organized opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> but at an immense cost. It concluded that
                    Chinese leaders were trying to control the forces they had unleashed and to
                    recreate a basic structure of power to replace the one they had weakened. (305)
                    In mid-1968, reports noted increasing economic dislocations caused by the
                    turbulence. A few weeks later Jenkins reported that the military was taking
                    action to stop factional fighting. As the end of the year approached, he thought
                    something akin to pre-Cultural Revolution “normalcy" was gradually returning to
                    Peking. (316, 320, 324, 333) In fact, the disorder was subsiding. Although it
                    would be several years before the Cultural Revolution completely ran its course,
                    there would be no return to the tumult of the previous two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">The Warsaw Talks</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The ambassadorial talks in Warsaw between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> representatives were held with decreasing frequency, with five
                    meetings in 1964, five in 1965, and only six in the following three years. Since
                    the Chinese continued to hold to the position that no progress could be made
                    until the United States agreed to withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan
                    area, and the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration regarded the entire
                    Taiwan issue as non-negotiable, the talks went nowhere. Nonetheless, U.S.
                    officials viewed them as a potentially useful channel of communication as well
                    as a defense against charges of inflexibility and lack of realism in U.S.
                    policy. The United States acquiesced only reluctantly in Chinese insistence in
                    prolonging the time between meetings, and U.S. representatives were instructed
                    to be sure that Washington would not be blamed for any break in the talks.
                    (22–23)</p>
                <p>As U.S. involvement in Vietnam increased, the administration sought to use the
                    talks to assure the Chinese that the United States did not want a confrontation
                    with China, as well as to convey U.S. firmness with regard to Vietnam. To insure
                    that the message was understood, they tried to lower the level of polemics.
                    Ambassador to Poland <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">John M. Cabot</persName>, the
                    U.S. representative in the talks until late 1965, reported a “collision course
                    atmosphere" at the July 1964 meeting, however, and declared that the September
                    meeting was the most vitriolic in months. (35, 37, 39–40, 53)</p>
                <p>At subsequent meetings, China's representative Wang Guoquan (Wang Kuo-ch'uan)
                    routinely castigated the United States for “aggression" and various alleged
                    actions in Vietnam. (71, 78–79, 84, 91, 101, 114, 137, 155, 180, 234, 270, 295)
                    U.S. officials continued to try to lower the level of rhetoric. When Cabot's
                    successor, <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">John A. Gronouski</persName>, was
                    instructed to return a Chinese letter referring to a U.S. proposal as a “sheer
                    swindle" aimed at covering up “crimes of aggression,” he pointed out that the
                    ambassadorial meetings were generally conducted in an atmosphere of polemics and
                    invective which would normally be grounds for a U.S. representative to walk out.
                        <persName>Wang</persName> had made statements to him, he said, which he
                    would not have accepted if made by a Polish official. He recommended against
                    returning the letter, and the instruction was withdrawn. (181)</p>
                <p>In early 1966, after an Embassy officer taped a radio broadcast of a session
                    which was apparently broadcast inadvertently by a Polish transmitter, U.S.
                    policymakers considered the possibility of moving the talks from the Polish
                    palace where they had been held since 1958 to the U.S. and Chinese Embassies.
                    They decided against proposing such a move, however. <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> thought it was useful for the Poles and the Russians
                    to be aware of the degree of Chinese inflexibility. (114, 124, 130) In the
                    spring of 1966, U.S. officials briefly considered proposing a meeting at the
                    Foreign Minister level but rejected the idea, fearing that because of the
                    situation in Vietnam, it would be construed as a sign of weakness. (152–153)</p>
                <p>Relations With the Nationalists</p>
                <p>French recognition of the P.R.C. in January 1964 provided the first challenge to
                    U.S. relations to the Nationalists. After trying unsuccessfully to dissuade the
                    French from taking this step, which it feared would trigger an avalanche of
                    shifts of recognition from Taipei to Peking, the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration tried to minimize its impact. (1, 3) Each Chinese government had
                    always insisted that any nation with which it had diplomatic relations must
                    acknowledge it as the sole government of China. U.S. officials thought the
                    French expected the Nationalists to break relations, enabling them to establish
                    diplomatic relations with the P.R.C. while placing the onus for the break on the
                    Nationalists. The administration sought to forestall this by persuading Chiang
                    Kai-shek not to break relations with France. (2, 4–8) In Chiang's view, this
                    issue was one that threatened his regime's very existence, but pressed hard by
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                    he delayed breaking relations. Finally, when the French Chargé in Taipei
                    declared that a P.R.C. representative would soon arrive in Paris, making the
                    Nationalist Chargé superfluous, the Nationalist Government withdrew its Chargé.
                    In the end, however, the dreaded avalanche of P.R.C. recognition did not occur.
                    (12, 13)</p>
                <p>The problems administration officials encountered with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> on the French recognition problem and the
                    Chinese representation issue revealed the gulf between Chiang's thinking and
                    theirs. <persName>Chiang</persName> maintained his faith that the Nationalists
                    would eventually regain control of the mainland. If any U.S. policymakers had
                    ever believed this, they no longer did. A September 1964 policy paper ruled out
                    U.S. adoption of a “two-China" policy but recommended that U.S. economic,
                    political, and security policies should be designed to facilitate the survival
                    of Taiwan as an independent entity. (48) In March 1965, <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">James C. Thomson</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff returned from a visit to Taiwan disturbed
                    by the effect on the relationship of the “unquestioned myth" of return to the
                    mainland. “On the face of it,” he wrote, “the situation is rather eerie; the
                        <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> [Government of the Republic of China]
                    knows that we don't believe it; and we know that they know we don't believe it;
                    and we suspect that some of them don't believe it; but no one says it. The
                    result is that our every relationship is affected by the unmentionable dead cat
                    on the floor.” (83) [Emphasis in the original.]</p>
                <p>Since 1962, <persName>Chiang</persName> had been pressing for U.S. support for
                    Nationalist operations to stimulate resistance on the mainland. The Kennedy
                    administration, convinced that such efforts would fail but fearing that a
                    complete rebuff might lead <persName>Chiang</persName> to launch a suicidal
                    attack, had temporized, acquiescing in small-scale raids but rejecting any
                    larger-scale operations. The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration at
                    first continued this policy. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> visited Taiwan in April 1964, Chiang suggested
                    consideration of operations against the mainland. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discouraged him, telling <persName>Chiang</persName> that
                    in his judgment the Nationalists could not establish themselves on the mainland
                    without large-scale assistance from the United States, the involvement of U.S.
                    troops, and possibly the use of nuclear weapons. <persName>Chiang</persName>
                    backed away from his suggestion, saying that he was opposed to the use of
                    nuclear weapons, especially against China. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> told <persName>Chiang</persName> the United States wanted
                    to keep in close touch and suggested the growing conflict in Southeast Asia
                    might lead to changes in the situation. (26)</p>
                <p>In September 1965, when Chiang's son, Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, visited Washington, he gave Secretary of
                    Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> a paper laying out a
                    “concept" for the seizure of China's five Southwest provinces. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was clearly skeptical, but Chiang
                    assured him the proposal would not require the use of U.S. ground forces or
                    nuclear weapons. Four months later, the Embassy in Taipei gave Chiang Ching-kuo
                    the U.S. reply rejecting the plan. In the U.S. view, it would require U.S.
                    naval, air, and logistic support, including air strikes against mainland bases,
                    meaning war with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, which the United
                    States did not want, and it was based on the expectation that a Nationalist
                    invasion would inspire popular uprisings, an expectation which U.S. intelligence
                    analysis did not support. (104, 110, 119–120)</p>
                <p>The exchange had brought to a head the fundamental but usually submerged issue of
                    the basic divergence between U.S. and Nationalist objectives in Asia, <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName> observed. U.S. policymakers had long
                    understood that the Nationalist desire for war with mainland China and the U.S.
                    desire to avoid such a collision were at cross purposes, but they had usually
                    been able to mute and disguise those differences. The latest proposal, with
                    Chiang Kai-shek's personal imprimatur, had been turned down flat. <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName> recommended the generous application
                    of “soft soap.” (121)</p>
                <p>The 1966 Congressional hearings on China, the Chinese representation issue, and
                    reductions in U.S. military aid added to Nationalist concern about a possible
                    shift in U.S. policy. The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration continued
                    to attach importance to good relations with the Nationalists, however. The war
                    in Vietnam increased the importance of the intelligence relationship, and the
                    Nationalists made airbase facilities on Taiwan available to support U.S. forces
                    in Vietnam. Rusk's visits to Taipei in July and December 1966 provided some
                    reassurance to Chiang. (132–134, 138, 142, 165, 169, 196, 222, 224, 293,
                    308)</p>
                <p>In early 1967, with the Cultural Revolution at its height,
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> renewed his plea for support for a return to the
                    mainland. He sent a message to <persName>Johnson</persName> urging that the
                    Sino-Soviet split and mainland unrest created a “golden opportunity" to rid the
                    mainland of the Communist regime, destroy the Chinese nuclear threat, and end
                    the Vietnam war. If he returned to the mainland, <persName>Chiang</persName>
                    argued, the people would rally to his cause. He would need only U.S. approval
                    and logistic support. (245) <persName>Johnson</persName> decided the time had
                    come to put an end to ambiguity. He sent a firm message to
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> declaring that the course he advocated would run
                    counter to U.S. policy of seeking to limit the war in Vietnam and end it by
                    negotiations. Instead, it would risk a wider war with “incalculable
                    consequences" for the people of Asia and the world. The American government and
                    people, he declared, “would not only disapprove such an action but would oppose
                    it.” (249)</p>
                <p>The Final Months of the <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration In mid-1968,
                        <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, disturbed by press
                    indications of possible changes in U.S. China policy, especially a New York
                    Times editorial hinting at abandonment of the offshore islands, pressed for a
                    U.S. public statement that U.S. policy on the islands had not changed. Without a
                    statement, he argued, press stories might incite a Communist attack on the
                    islands. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that there was no
                    change in U.S. policy but that it was not in the interest of either country to
                    encourage controversial public discussion on the subject. (315, 318)
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> then requested a squadron of the latest high
                    performance fighters, F–4C Phantom jets, and, until the squadron could arrive,
                    the stationing of a U.S. squadron of F–4Cs on Taiwan. There was no reason to
                    believe that a <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> attack on the offshore
                    islands was imminent, <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> told
                        <persName>Rostow</persName>. He thought <persName>Chiang</persName> wanted a
                    new, high-profile U.S. commitment of support before the next administration took
                    office. Chiang's requests were rejected, but U.S. policymakers sought to
                    reassure him by agreeing to station a few high performance fighters on Taiwan
                    for a few days each month through the end of 1968. (319, 321, 325, 327, 329)</p>
                <p>The Cultural Revolution had lessened pressure on U.S. policymakers for changes in
                    policy toward the P.R.C. In early 1968, President <persName>Johnson</persName>,
                    after meeting with a panel of academic China specialists, requested his
                    advisers' views on the situation in China and any possibilities for change in
                    U.S. policies. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName>, and the China experts agreed that
                    China was far too chaotic for any attempt at rapprochement to be reciprocated
                    but that steps to liberalize trade and travel regulations might be useful. They
                    disagreed on the Chinese representation issue, with the experts favoring a
                    change in U.S. policy, while Rusk opposed it. (299, 302–303, 305) Despite the
                    seeming agreement on liberalizing trade and travel regulations, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> rejected an initiative to remove
                    restrictions on travel to China, and in the final weeks of the administration,
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> rejected a proposal for a small change in trade
                    restrictions. (306, 336) Nonetheless, as <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> observed, the groundwork had been laid for future
                    change. (328)</p>

                <p>Questions concerning Tibet and U.S. policy toward Mongolia are covered in
                    separate compilations. The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration continued
                    its predecessors' policies of assistance to Tibetan refugees in India and
                    limited support for the Tibetan resistance. (337–343) The administration
                    considered but did not pursue the question of recognition of Mongolia.

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume,
                    which was compiled in 1993–1994, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in
                    accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration. The declassification review and opening for public
                    review of all Department of State records no later than 30 years after the
                    events is mandated by the Foreign Relations statute. The Department of State and
                    other record sources used in the volume are described in detail in the section

                <p>The editor of the volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign
                    policymaking process of the U.S. Government, with emphasis on the highest level
                    at which policy on a particular subject was determined. The documents include
                    memoranda and records of discussions that set forth policy issues and show
                    decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy
                    and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution, but not details of
                    policy execution.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> made the major foreign
                    policy decisions during his presidency, and the editor sought to document his
                    role as far as possible. Although the foreign policy record of the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration is voluminous, many internal
                    discussions between <persName>Johnson</persName> and his advisers were not
                    recorded. The record of <persName>Johnson</persName>'s involvement in the policy
                    process must often be pieced together from a variety of sources. Secretary of
                    State Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s role is perhaps even
                    more elusive. The editor sought to document Johnson's and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s roles in the policy process as far as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>The volume focuses on the issues that primarily engaged high-level U.S.
                    policymakers. Major topics include: 1) U.S. anticipation of the first Chinese
                    nuclear explosion and the U.S. reaction when it took place in October 1964; 2)
                    the attempts of U.S. policymakers to deal with the issue of Chinese
                    representation in the United Nations; 3) U.S. relations with the Chinese
                    Nationalists on Taiwan, especially the question of possible Nationalist
                    operations against the mainland; 4) the ambassadorial meetings at Warsaw; 5)
                    proposals to liberalize U.S. restrictions on travel to and trade with the China
                    mainland; 6) the U.S. response to French recognition of the People's Republic of
                    China; and 7) U.S. policy concerning Tibet.</p>
                <p>The absence of U.S. diplomatic representation in the People's Republic of China
                    increased the importance of intelligence on China. The editor included a
                    selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level
                    policymakers, especially those that were sent to President
                        <persName>Johnson</persName>, and made a particular effort to include a
                    sampling of reports and analyses on the Cultural Revolution. Selected
                    intelligence estimates and analyses on internal developments in Taiwan were also
                    included.</p>

                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>

                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations series</hi> follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to

                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which was completed in 1997,
                    resulted in the decision to withhold about 1.3 percent of the documentation
                    selected. Three documents were denied in full. The remaining documentation
                    provides an accurate account of U.S. policy toward China, including policy
                    concerning Tibet, and U.S. policy toward Mongolia during this period.</p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,

                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. When this volume was being compiled, all Department
                    of State records consulted were still under the custody of the Department, and
                    the footnotes citing Department of State files suggest that the Department is
                    the repository. By the time of publication, however, all the Department's
                    indexed central (or decimal) files for these years were permanently transferred
                    to the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) at College
                    Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized office (or lot) files
                    covering this period, which the National Archives deems worthy of permanent
                    retention, will also be transferred from the Department's custody to Archives II
                    over the next several years.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName>Johnson</persName> and other White
                    House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at
                    the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. Numerous White House memoranda, including
                    memoranda to the President, testify to President <persName>Johnson</persName>'s
                    concern with issues relating to China, especially China's nuclear development,
                    the Chinese representation issue, and internal developments in China during the
                    Cultural Revolution. The bulk of the foreign policy records at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library are in the country files and other
                    component parts of the National Security File. The China Country File includes
                    records on issues concerning the China mainland and also on relations with the
                    Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. Material pertaining to the ambassadorial talks
                    at Warsaw is in the Poland Country File.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the audiotapes of President
                        <persName>Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations, which are held at
                    the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library. The first audiotapes became available
                    to the editors in late <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>1994, after this
                    volume was completed. Others became available after the declassification process
                    was well underway. The editor did not consider that the small portion of
                    material in those tapes pertaining to U.S. policy toward China justified delay
                    in the publication of the volume. Information concerning a few conversations
                    pertaining to China is included in the volume.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library were the records of the Department of
                    State. The Department's central files contain the cable traffic recording U.S.
                    diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and the ambassadorial
                    talks at Warsaw, memoranda of diplomatic conversations, and memoranda proposing
                    action or providing information. Some important documents are found only in Lot
                    Files. The Conference Files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain
                    briefing materials as well as records of conversations. Documentation on
                    initiatives that were not approved is often found only in desk or bureau files.
                    The <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> Files contain records of
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s telephone
                    conversations.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians
                    to high-level intelligence documents from those records in the custody of that
                    Agency and at the Presidential Libraries. This access is arranged and
                    facilitated by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
                    Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.
                    Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue
                    to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of identifying the key portions
                    of the intelligence record.</p>
                <p>The China volume has an important intelligence component, including finished
                    intelligence and some covert operations. In <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    records, the files of the Directors of Central Intelligence, especially
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>'s, were especially
                    useful. Retired files of the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and
                    Research contained National Intelligence Estimates, and the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Historical Files provided records of the
                    meetings of the 303 Committee, the interdepartmental committee that reviewed and
                    authorized covert operations, and related material.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of Defense (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>) at
                    the Washington National Records Center at Suitland, Maryland, particularly the
                    records of the Secretary of Defense and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
                    International Security Affairs, provided important documents. The papers of
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">W. Averell Harriman</persName> at the Library of
                    Congress include some valuable material relating to China not available
                    elsewhere. The papers of Maxwell D. Taylor at the National Defense University
                    contain records of White House staff meetings for the early part of 1964.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign
                    Relations series thanks to the consent of the foregoing agencies, the <pb n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0017"/>assistance of their staffs, and
                    especially the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of these records in process. Many of the records are already available
                    for public review at the National Archives. The declassification review of other
                    records is going forward in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order
                    12958, under which all records over 25 years old, except file series exemptions
                    requested by agencies and approved by the President, should be reviewed for
                    declassification by 2000.</p>

                        by France was very disturbing to the US and to other governments as well.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> emphasized he was
                        speaking personally and without instructions but as well-known long-time
                        warm friend of France. Response of President and US government would no
                        doubt be forthcoming in due time. French action would be in direct conflict
                        with fundamental US interests. It could not help having cooling effect on US
                        popular feeling towards France. This was not an action we would have
                        expected from an ally. It would seem the only gain to France is the
                        assertion of its independence for the sake of asserting independence. This
                        was an act on the part of France which can do no good to anyone and can do
                        great harm to many.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> continued still on personal
                        basis saying <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> must have
                        known the effect of such a decision on the US. There was little to gain for
                        France and there would be great damage to the US. The Ambassador must
                        realize what the effect would be if US and French roles were reversed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he did not understand
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s reaction. Others have
                        recognized Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                        reminded him these actions had been prior to Korean war.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he also would speak
                        personally and unofficially. He failed completely to understand this
                        reaction. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> was one of ablest and cleverest
                        diplomats he knew. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> knew
                        exactly what he meant. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said
                        French action would create doubt in Asia and would give a boost to Communist
                        China. French action would create great difficulty for people and government
                        and President of US. It was clear decision had been taken with total
                        disregard of important US interests. France will be throwing away a great
                        deal of good will and affection here in the US only for the sake of
                        demonstrating its independence of US policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out US has great
                        responsibilities in the Far East, although we welcomed France taking more
                        responsibility in such places as Laos and Cambodia. However, basic problem
                        is containing Communist China and France can contribute very little as far
                        as this basic problem is concerned. Burden rests squarely on US and France
                        is strengthening our enemy. The Korean war has never been settled. Other
                        areas of Asia are seething with Communist-supported conflicts. France has
                        chosen the moment when our enemy is weak to help him.</p>

                    <p>In a telephone conversation between President <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        and Senator Richard Russell at 4:30 p.m. on January 15, 1964,
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> told Russell that “<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s going to recognize Communist
                        China" and that the question was whether he should send a personal message
                        to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> with a strong protest or
                        send a lower-level protest for the record. His inclination was to do the
                        latter. Russell told the President he “wouldn't go too strong on it" because
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would not pay much
                        attention. Russell added, “The time's going to come when we might well—can't
                        talk about it now—the time's going to come when we're going to have to
                        recognize them.” <persName>Johnson</persName> replied, “Yeah, I think
                        so—don't think there's any question about it.”Russell went on, “I ain't too
                        sure but what we'd have been better off if we'd recognized them three-four
                        years ago.” <persName>Johnson</persName> replied, “I think so. It's the only
                        thing Bill Douglas [Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas] said—“Russell
                        broke in, “Politically, right now it's poison, of course.” The conversation
                        then turned to other subjects. At the end of the conversation,
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> returned to the subject of how to respond
                        to the French action: “About this <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> thing, you just think we ought to play it as low key
                        and just make a little protest for the record.”Russell agreed. (Johnson

                        President, “The one chance that we can frustrate <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is to get <persName>Chiang</persName> to stand
                        still for a week or so. If he would not break his relations with the French,
                        which is what he's always done when people recognize Peking before, this
                        would put the monkey right back on Peking's back, because they have
                        maintained a position that they can't recognize anybody who also recognizes
                        Formosa. What the French hope is that <persName>Chiang</persName> will break
                        relations right away, and that is probably what he'll do. We <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0038"/>want to advise him to stand still for a week.
                        Is that all right with you?" <persName>Johnson</persName> agreed. (Ibid.,

                    <p>“My dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Your Government has been informed of reliable indications we have that the
                        French Government intends to recognize the Chinese Communist regime in the
                        near future. We have also learned that the Chinese Communists are prepared
                        to accept French recognition without imposing any condition and that France
                        intends to maintain its diplomatic relations with your Government.</p>
                    <p>I want you to know that the United States has done everything possible to
                        deter the French Government from this ill-advised action. We have told the
                        French at the highest levels that French recognition of the Peiping regime
                        can only damage free world interests. We have asked France to reconsider its
                        intention. We know that other governments are doing the same.</p>
                    <p>Despite our efforts, there is no indication of change in France's attitude.
                        We understand that Paris and Peiping intend to exchange Ambassadors three
                        months after announcing diplomatic ties. In this situation it is vitally
                        important for our two Governments to work closely together to reduce by all
                        means the ill effects of this event.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the Chinese Communists will strongly resent continued French
                        relations with your Government, and hope that your Government <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0039"/>will take the initiative in severing
                        relations with France as a result of French recognition of their regime.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> is undoubtedly
                        gambling on your Government doing just this, thereby relieving him from the
                        burden of appearing to accept a 'two China' situation. Therefore, I believe
                        it would be extremely wise for you to refrain from retaliatory action
                        against France at this time. Your patience will cause <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> the greatest possible
                        embarrassment. It will greatly reduce the advantages which the Chinese
                        Communists expect to gain by the establishment of relations with France.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I wish to give you my personal assurance that we shall continue to
                        stand by you and your Government and to provide all possible support in our
                        common endeavors.</p>

                        said he saw no reason for French action except assert independ-ence and
                        embarrass US. This was not so. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>
                        pointed out Western nations which recognized Communist China prior to Korean
                        war had <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0040"/>not broken relations during
                        war. It was now twelve years later and France believed it should act. First
                        point he wished to make was France did not consider recognition meant
                        approval. Second point was Soviet Union and Communist China no longer
                        monolithic bloc. Previously there was no need to talk to Peiping. One could
                        talk to Moscow as the master of Peiping. There is now a split in the bloc
                        and one must talk directly to Peiping. Contrary to US belief France may be
                        able to achieve something useful through this channel, speaking especially
                        of Asia and Southeast Asia in particular. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> stressed establishment diplomatic relations France
                        has in view is without commitment. There is no requirement to break
                        relations with Taiwan and nothing is said about the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he was surprised by text
                        of US note. France hopes US will not think its action done as a gesture
                        against US but that there are other reasons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had pointed
                        out he was speaking personally and as old well-known friend of France.
                        Secretary would now speak officially. Recognition will increase the prestige
                        of Peiping. Since Korean war no country comparing in prestige to France has
                        recognized Communist China. France must consider the effect of its action.
                        If France finds American people react strongly, France must realize we are
                        taking casualties every day. Just a short time ago we found 7 tons of
                        Chinese Communist made arms south of Saigon. We are spitting blood.</p>
                    <p>Secretary continued we do not believe agreement can be reached with China
                        through means adopted by France. Communist China does not respect its
                        agreements. President Kennedy felt we took French views into full account
                        over Laos. We expect our views to be considered by France now.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> had claimed
                        recognition does not mean approval but it will be so interpreted. He had
                        reviewed with <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> many times our
                        views on Communist China. US is aiding India resist Chinese Communist
                        aggression. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s are active in
                        subversion in Latin America. Secretary pointed out if French action leads to
                        Chinese Communist subversive centers in Africa, this will be more of problem
                        for France than for US.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> had mentioned no
                        conditions imposed on France by Peiping. He emphasized there were also no
                        conditions imposed by France on Peiping, such as even minimum requirement
                        for Chinese Communists to honor commitments in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> protested French position not
                        taken to oppose US. France believed its action might be beneficial to all.
                        France was doing only what others have long since done. French recognition
                        might be useful in obtaining agreement at conference to neutralize Cambodia.
                        Secretary said 1954 Agreement already exists which <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s are not honoring. It <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0041"/>is possible to have contacts with Chinese
                        Communists without recognizing them. There is very slight chance US would
                        attend a conference on Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> asked if French Government had
                        assessed probable effect on Taiwan. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said relations with Peiping did not prevent
                        relations with Taiwan. Secretary said Peiping may be gambling on Taiwan
                        breaking relations. If Taiwan does not break relations is France not
                        exposing itself to rebuff by Peiping?</p>
                    <p>Secretary said he would not judge how France regards its national interest,
                        but he would think French relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, the United
                        States and Southeast Asia would be worth more than its relations with
                        Peiping because all these other relations would be affected.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he could not control US
                        press, public or congressional reaction, but US Government could at least
                        say French action not taken against US. As to timing there comes a time when
                        one must do what one has long felt is right.</p>
                    <p>Secretary inquired how France intends to handle Africa. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said France does not intend to
                        dictate but does not know if French African states will follow example of
                        France.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said two things will erode attitude of American people toward
                        alliance in coming months: 1) recognition of Communist China; and 2) Western
                        European trade with Cuba. If Western European countries consider these
                        problems as matters for each alone to decide, then US attitude will be
                        seriously eroded. Secretary was very much concerned over alliance in next
                        three months.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said we can understand that our allies do not give same priority as
                        US to matters in Pacific. US however is bearing burdens both in Europe and
                        in Far East. If we find in carrying out our responsibilities our position is
                        being weakened or undermined, this is bound to affect our relations.
                        Secretary said if French decision irrevocable then it is duty both
                        governments to circumscribe and attempt to limit damage which will
                        inevitably be caused.</p>

                                        allies do same. In this connection, Secretary cited support
                                        from Germany and Italy, but particularly emphasized vigorous
                                        efforts Japanese had made on behalf <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and in attempt to forestall French

                                unsuccessful in effort get French to accept <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Ambassador. Most recent request made last fall
                                during ForMin <persName>Shen</persName>'s visit France. Secretary
                                suggested <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> give thought to
                                renewing such request now as means testing French. If France refused
                                we would then be in a position puncture bubble of French willingness
                                give <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s equal treatment. Secretary
                                pointed out that it may be two or three months before exchange of
                                Ambassadors between France and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s took place, and that in meantime France may
                                have to put certain conditions on Peiping in connection with French
                                plans for South Vietnam. In any event, Secretary stressed it was
                                important to make the recognition matter as difficult as possible
                                for both Paris and Peiping.</item>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said that he had been
                        instructed to take up with the Secretary two matters relating to Japan.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, his Government wished him to call the Secretary's attention to
                            certain developments in Japanese politics. During the last several years
                            Prime Minister Ikeda had, willingly or unwillingly, associated himself
                            with and promoted the political influence of Ichiro Kono, Kenzo
                            Matsumura, Tatsunosuke Takasaki and Takeo Miki. As a result, the
                            political influence of these individuals had increased. With the
                            development of trade with the mainland, Kono particularly had been able
                            to acquire considerable funds for political purposes. Kono was building
                            up a political organization of his own in hopes of promoting a different
                            type of governing coalition in which he, Kono, would be the Prime
                            Minister while Ikeda became the honorary chief of the coalition. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wished to warn the Secretary
                            that Japanese trade with the mainland would not only help Communist
                            China but would also, on the Japanese side, corrupt Japanese politics in
                            the direction of the left. The Secretary said that he would bear in mind
                            what the Ambassador had said.</item>
                        <item>Second, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said
                            that the Japanese Government was considering establishing a permanent
                            trade mission in Peiping, reciprocated by a Chinese Communist permanent
                            trade mission in Tokyo. The Ambassador said that his Government hoped
                            that the Secretary would use his influence to prevent this. The
                            Secretary said that he planned to discuss the mainland trade question in
                            Tokyo and would see what could be done.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was very disappointed and disturbed over news of the
                        manner in which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is handling the
                        French-Communist Chinese recognition matter.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">Telegram 616 from Taipei, January 21, reported that Foreign Minister
                                <persName>Shen</persName> had told Wright that
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> had received a letter from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that had convinced him that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> intended to
                            formalize relations with Peking swiftly and that it would be impossible
                            to keep an Ambassador in Paris even for a short time. (Department of
                            State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 17 FR–<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">CHICOM</gloss>)</note> There appears to us to be
                        overwhelming evidence that if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        refuses to break relations with France this would have a major impact on
                        Peiping in its attempt to establish diplomatic relations throughout the
                        world. The Secretary said that we have no wish to interfere in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s business in giving them advice. However,
                        the United States' future relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, its relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        and Southeast Asia are all very much involved. We need the cooperation of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. If there were only a 50 percent or
                        even a 33 percent chance that the French-Communist Chinese move could be
                        frustrated it would be of the greatest importance that that chance be taken.
                        The consequences of failure are such that we should take any step that might
                        assist in frustrating the Paris-Peiping action. If France succeeds in
                        establishing relations with Peiping in circumstances where the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has made it easy <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0045"/>for them to do so, we will not be able to commit our
                        prestige in other cases, in other capitals. We need maximum assistance from
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to deal with this problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should not
                        only continue to protest France's action—the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should in addition make it just as hard as possible for
                        Paris and Peiping to carry their plan out. Our information and strong belief
                        is that France would be unwilling to take the initiative in breaking
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The Secretary said
                        that he hoped the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and people of Taiwan
                        saw the gravity of the matter as we see it in our own national interest. As
                        he had said, ours is not just the advice of a friend. We too have an
                        important stake and need the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s help. If
                        it becomes clear that we are not able to work together in an effort to make
                        the establishment of relations between France and Communist China as
                        difficult as possible, the loss of interest in the U.S. in the effort to
                        support the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will be very severe. The
                        Secretary said that he had been reading records of Congressional discussions
                        of the matter which clearly confirmed this. This is an extremely important
                        matter. If we cannot work together on this, it would be very difficult to
                        work together effectively as we have for so many years in support of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests. He was not pointing a finger at
                        the Ambassador personally since he knew the Ambassador had correctly
                        reported their discussions. But he wanted to be sure that the Government at
                        Taiwan understands the utter gravity of the problem. He understood that
                        Ambassador Wright had not been afforded opportunity to discuss the matter
                        personally with President <persName>Chiang</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said that his
                        information was scanty. He was not personally familiar with all aspects of
                        the problem and was not in a position to say anything at the moment. He
                        would report with all clarity to his Government what the Secretary had
                        said.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to add a further point. There had been
                        intimations that in Taiwan there were some who suspected that we were trying
                        to booby-trap the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> into a false position.
                        This was not true. Such an interpretation would be very badly received
                        here.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said that it was hard
                        for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to distinguish official from
                        unofficial views and comment in Washington. So many people wanted to speak
                        their minds on the problem, including, for example, Mr.
                            <persName>Lippmann</persName>. The Secretary said that Mr.
                            <persName>Lippmann</persName> had held the same position for 15 years.
                        He could understand the difficulties President <persName>Chiang</persName>
                        had in dealing with a man like DeGaulle. He could show the Ambassador his
                        own wounds. DeGaulle is a very complex man, almost impossible to persuade.
                        The Secretary reiterated that our information is that Paris is very worried
                        over the possibility that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will not
                        break relations.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said that his
                        personal recommendation to Taipei had been that the Government should sit
                        tight through the announcement <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0046"/>of
                        recognition, but should withdraw after completion of an exchange of
                        ambassadors. He had warned his Government not to talk about future steps.
                        The Secretary said that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should give
                        no indication of intention to withdraw in any circumstances. He made plain
                        that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should not give any indication
                        that it would withdraw its Paris Embassy if a Chinese Communist Ambassador
                        arrived, or the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s whole position will be
                        undercut.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that looking ahead, we are in a major battle of a long
                        campaign. If Paris goes ahead we will be faced probably quite soon with a
                        danger of recognition of Peiping by some African countries, by Belgium, by
                        Canada, by Japan and by other countries. It is true that 42 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> nations recognize Peking. But France is a
                        special case—if this hole is made in the dam the prospect is that the water
                        will flood through. The Secretary said that he could not emphasize too
                        strongly the importance of doing all we can to frustrate Paris' and
                        Peiping's move.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">Wright reported in telegram 648

                            <persName>Chiang</persName> requested another meeting with me where he
                        said he had briefed <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> on basic points of
                        earlier talk and also discussed subject with Premier and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He said <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> understood US view that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should lodge protest when French recognize
                        Peiping and should issue strong statement <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0048"/>against “two China" policy but should await further
                        developments before breaking off relations. <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> felt that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action and
                        its timing would depend on content and timing of French announcement. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> announced he breaking
                        with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> nothing could be done. If French
                        statement equivocal <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would consider
                        possible responses aiming at US objectives.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> said in any event <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and US mutually affected by French action and grave
                        consequences likely to follow made it essential <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and US work together on Asian problems. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans to recover mainland would have helped
                        prevent this situation if they had been carried out. Now necessary to talk
                        about how to save <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and US position in
                        Asia, not just in Paris. He felt serious political troubles would arise in
                        Taiwan if prospects for return to mainland become remote.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>
                        wanted to know what US would do if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        maneuvers in Paris won some time before <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        ouster. Replied that time would permit moral and political pressure on
                        France not to consummate full diplomatic relation, would assist in urging
                        other nations not to follow French lead, and would permit strong US effort
                        to rally support for defense Southeast Asia and free China against <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> thrusts to dominate area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> said he hoped all points made in our talks would
                        be got across to <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>. At this point upon
                        request of Ambassador I said Ambassador would want to accompany me for talk
                        with <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> and we would be ready anytime.
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> said he would report to his father and get
                        in touch with me later.</p>
                    <p>In third meeting with me on January 27, <persName>Chiang</persName> said he
                        had reported second meeting to <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> wished me to know that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reaction to French recognition had been
                        thoroughly discussed between two countries and given deep consideration by
                            <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>'s decision had been passed to Ambassador Wright. Up to
                        this point the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> still held to this
                        position in principle but the government was willing to study French
                        recognition statement and reconsider their decision if nature of statement
                        allowed it. <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> did not deem French
                        recognition as most important point but rather effects it would have on
                        world situation, in Asia and particularly Southeast Asia. He hoped that
                        while I was here I would discuss fully implications of French recognition
                        especially on US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests in Asia.
                        The <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> felt that two matters of principle
                        should be discussed after the French announcement: <list>

                    <p>In ensuing discussion <persName>Chiang</persName> Ching-Kuo expressing his
                        own views hoped US would consider <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        problems. He catalogued restraints placed by US on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action against the mainland. He said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would never “sell the soul of its people"
                        on the mainland. Later in emotional voice he said “We may smile on the
                        surface but our hearts are heavy.” The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        would not go against US interests but they were afraid that Taiwan might
                        fall to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s without a fight.</p>
                    <p>He said news stories from Washington that the US pressuring <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on French recognition issue were giving
                        government bad time in party.</p>
                    <p>I said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> can count on support from US but
                        that support would be stronger if it clear that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to blame for breaking relations, not <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. I emphasized that US not asking <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to accept “two-China" policy but to stay
                        and fight at same time forcing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                        <item>The Chinese economy has recovered somewhat from its 1960–1961 low, but
                            its prospects are considerably worse than in 1957.<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">In the following discussion we use 1957 as a base
                                year for comparison because it was the eve of the Great Leap
                                Forward, and because the per capita grain output in that year
                                represents a level of production that provided farmers and factory
                                workers an adequate diet, made grain imports unnecessary, and
                                permitted the export of modest amounts of grain and other
                                agricultural products. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Any
                            Chinese government would face monumental economic problems resulting
                            from the huge and growing population, inadequate arable land, and the
                            low level of technology. The problems of the Chinese Communists are
                            compounded by their own past errors, their ideological compulsions, the
                            break with the Soviet Union, and extreme nationalism. (Paras. 1–10)<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">The paragraph numbers refer to the discussion

                        <item>Grain output in 1963 was no greater than in 1957, when there were some
                            75 million fewer people to feed. Peiping's mismanagement and the
                            post-1960 decline of Soviet support have grievously hurt the industrial
                            sector; total output in 1963 remains far below the 1959 peak. A few
                            priority industries, such as those supporting agriculture and the
                            petroleum industry, are operating at close to capacity, but many suffer
                            from unbalanced development, technological deficiencies, and shortages
                            of parts and raw materials. Foreign trade is at the lowest point since
                            1954. That with the Soviet Union has declined more than 60 percent since
                            1959, and China has become a substantial importer of food from the Free
                            World. (Paras. 11–26)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>We believe that the Chinese Communists will seek and obtain additional
                            credits and technical assistance from the Free World, but in relatively
                            modest amounts. We do not believe that diplomatic recognition by France
                            and other Free World countries will alter this picture substantially.
                            (Para. 27)</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>We believe that agricultural production in the next few years is
                            unlikely to grow much faster than the population, and that industry will
                            grow at a rate well below what was achieved in the mid-1950s. The
                            Chinese are likely to continue to devote more attention to agriculture
                            in both <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0051"/>their domestic and import
                            programs, but will probably not divert enough resources from industry
                            and the arms program to put agriculture on a sound footing. We believe
                            that the Chinese will be anxious to revert to a policy favoring
                            industrial development, and will be prone to do so prematurely. We
                            believe that difficulties will accumulate in the economy, within the
                            leadership, and between the regime and the people. We thus do not
                            believe that China can become a modern industrial state for many years.
                            China's direct military threat to the West will remain limited, but
                            China will continue to be a major force in Asia, and a crucial menace to
                            its Asian neighbors and to Western interests in the area. (Paras.

                            positive in my opening statement. Said hope for relaxation tensions
                            Taiwan Straits and Far East and improvements in our relations in the New
                            Year depend on Washington not Peiping. Said China was victim of
                            aggression. Said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must [garble]
                            change in its erroneous China policy of aggression and mil encirclement.
                            This policy leads to blind alley. US seizure Taiwan by armed force is
                            root of bad relations. If this key issue were resolved other questions
                            would not be difficult. Converse all attempts resolving side issues of
                            no avail until key issues solved. Two-China policy will not be
                            tolerated. Quoted recent statements Secretary and Undersecretary
                            Harriman in attempt prove we had assumed proprietary air in saying US
                            would never “turn over" Taiwan. <persName>Wang</persName> complained of

                    <p>680. At two and one half hour meeting with President this evening,
                        Ambassador, visitor, FinMin, <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Ching-kuo</persName>
                        and interpreter <persName>Shen</persName>. After generalities President
                        asked how we viewed the future. We replied three steps: first, prevent
                        French-Communist [China] consummation of their proposed establishment
                        relationships, second, urge other nations not to follow, third, support
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and fourth, strengthen and develop
                        backing for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Asked President if he had any proposals. President answered, under US policy
                        of open door and accommodation very little to suggest. If commie regime not
                        overthrown or destroyed PM [<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>?] will
                        swallow up <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and all others opposed.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0054"/>
                    <p>After discussion President said first step to study French objectives. Three
                        years ago <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> sent emissary to
                        President who suggested <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> abandon
                        exclusive reliance on USA and make France third partner. Quid pro quo would
                        be exchange of Ambassadors. This first unmistakable indication French
                        motives to expel US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, restore French
                        influence all Southeast Asia and to pursue alliance with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s for this purpose. Latest attitudes
                        towards Laos and Cambodia neutralization, and Chicom recognition all
                        verify.</p>
                    <p>President said US failed to realize the effect on morale of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> people and forces caused by deteriorating
                        situation in East. State of mind frail and brittle. Danger <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> will seize and capitalize on this and
                        overcome his country by infiltration and subversion.</p>
                    <p>President said he must have some way of reassuring his people that he will
                        never agree to two-Chinas situation. So long as there is no two-Chinas there
                        will be hope for return to mainland and high morale in his people and
                        forces. If we had taken steps to recover mainland three years ago, French
                        recognition would not have happened. If we move against the mainland French
                        recognition of us would be of no importance. Once we take this action it
                        will have reassuring effect on morale of people and forces. He said if
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had been left alone they would have
                        taken such action to restore the mainland three years ago. However, he is
                        well aware of US attitude and has no intention to act at present time.</p>
                    <p>If we fail to take some action which will have a similar effect on
                        maintenance of morale we will open the gates to infiltration and subversion
                        in which the people and forces would be demoralized and the Chicoms could
                        take over without the use of force and by their well-known tactics of
                        “peaceful liberation”, in which the Seventh Fleet would be helpless.</p>
                    <p>Knowing US policy well, could not the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ask
                        the United States come forth some formula to maintain morale of people and
                        armed forces?</p>
                    <p>The President said he had some views on this subject. There are three
                        interrelated war zones: South Vietnam, Korea, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Collapse of one will affect the other two. French
                        recognition creates a new situation in South Vietnam where commies will use
                        French influence to sabotage US actions with view to forcing US to pull out.
                        Effect of pull out would be such that US prestige would suffer so much that
                        no reassurances would prevent demoralization in Korea and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would submit three proposals: Plan one. US take the
                        lead to establish a four-nation alliance of US, Korea, South Vietnam and
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, such that armed forces of one would
                        be at disposal of others for movement to troubled areas.</p>
                    <p>Plan two. A three-nation alliance of Korea, South Vietnam and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> with US to give only its blessing, air
                        cover and naval support.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0055"/>
                    <p>Plan three. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> make separate bi-lateral
                        agreements with South Vietnam and Korea with same US support which would
                        permit exchange of forces for mutual support.</p>
                    <p>Note that in plans two and three US could officially stand aside providing
                        only support. He said plans two or three were a minimum requirement for the
                        maintenance of stability and morale in the area. Frankly he does not see how
                        US can maintain position in South Vietnam without some such alliance which
                        would permit use of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops. There
                        followed detailed discussion three plans including effect on Laos, Burma and
                        Thailand.</p>
                    <p>Asked about Japan. President said Japan was out. Her constitution would not
                        permit it. Communism and infiltration have gone too far and her country is
                        now divided in two, one under Ikeda and one under communists. US should not
                        overestimate role of Japan in the East.</p>
                    <p>President said at his last meeting with General <persName>Marshall</persName>
                        that if US persists in its policy mainland will fall to communists. Same
                        applies today to all Southeast Asia and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Discussion concluded with assurances of careful US consideration and
                        generalities.</p>
                    <p>Foregoing is a brief of long discussion much along previously reported
                        lines.</p>

                            conversation with <persName>Shen</persName>, who stated that the French
                            Chargé had made an oral statement to him that day that France would
                            exchange diplomatic representatives with Peking soon and that once the
                            Chargé from Peking arrived in Paris, the French would consider him as
                            the representative of China; consequently, the Republic of China
                            diplomatic mission would lose its raison d'etre. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">CHICOM</gloss>-FR)</note> At a twenty minute meeting with the
                        President at 1800 today he confirmed the arrival of the French communication
                        delivered orally to the Foreign Minister by French Charge Pierre Salade this
                        morning. He considered this as an official communication from the French
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>President said he had cooperated with the United States in his handling of
                        the January 27 announcement and the January 31 press conference but he
                        considered that the French message delivered by the French Charge had ended
                        the period of manuever. He said that at a meeting of his government after
                        arrival of the message he had decided that the relations of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the Government of France had been
                        terminated by the French communication. I said that in speaking for the
                        United States all our efforts had been bent on forcing the French to take
                        the initiative and I hoped that in handling this matter the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would assure by all means available that
                        the responsibility for this action in the eyes of the world rested squarely
                        on the French. The President replied that there was no doubt in his mind
                        that the French Government with the delivery of the French Charge message
                        had in fact taken the initiative.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked that I convey to the Secretary of State and
                        President <persName>Johnson</persName> that relations between the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the Government of France had by French
                        action ceased to exist.</p>
                    <p>There will be an emergency Cabinet meeting at 2100 to decide on the form in
                        which the French action will be announced. The Premier stated there would be
                        an announcement to the press tonight.</p>
                    <p>I have urged the Premier and Foreign Minister to get the French message in
                        writing to facilitate a clear public understanding but both have stated that
                        they considered that the meaning of the French message was clear and
                        unmistakable and therefore a written statement would not be requested. I
                        repeated to Premier and Foreign Minister the need for wording of their
                        announcement so as to make it clear that the initiative for breaking
                        relations had been taken by the French.</p>

                            breaking relations with France for two weeks, thus forcing both Peiping
                            and Paris to make clear that France was obliged to drop its diplomatic

                            price of establishing relations with Peiping. This was a gain for the
                            U.S. since many nations would recognize Peiping if they thought they
                            could maintain diplomatic relations with “Two Chinas.” Few nations have
                            followed the French lead because it became clear that any nation
                            recognizing Peiping had to go all the way and recognize its right to

                            low; (b) a senior Chinese General had attempted on 21 January 1964 to

                            he failed); (c) President <persName>Chiang</persName> told me personally

                            present trends would bring a military coup in Taipei against the present

                    <p>820. Please deliver following letter to President <persName>Chiang</persName>
                        from President <persName>Johnson</persName>:</p>
                    <p>“March 2, 1964. Dear Mr. President: I greatly appreciate your letter of 1
                        February, which I have most carefully studied. I should also like to <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0062"/>thank you for the cordial reception
                        given Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Ray Cline</persName>. He has reported
                        fully on your strategic concerns and recommendations with respect to the
                        situation in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Your views on world problems are always much valued here. We too are actively
                        concerned over possible trends in the Far East, though I can assure you that
                        we intend to meet our responsibilities squarely and are confident that the
                        forces of freedom will not be found wanting.</p>
                    <p>I am also confident that through continual close consultation and
                        coordination our two governments will find mutually acceptable solutions to
                        the problems which particularly concern us. As to steps which might be taken
                        to offset the adverse effects of France's deplorable recognition of the
                        Chinese Communist regime, some of the suggestions which you and your
                        officials have made are already being carried out and others are under
                        intensive study. I am asking Ambassador Wright to discuss them with you in
                        detail, and to keep in closest touch with your represent-atives so as to
                        ensure full coordination.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of primary urgency, I believe it essential to mount an
                        intensified diplomatic effort to strengthen your country's international
                        position, especially within the United Nations. We want to cooperate fully
                        with you in this effort, but you must take the laboring oar.</p>
                    <p>We further intend to take steps to cope more effectively with Communist
                        aggression in Southeast Asia, which, as you emphasize, poses grave risks to
                        all free world countries whether or not they acknowledge it. In this
                        connection we have again reviewed our bilateral and multilateral defense
                        arrangements in Asia, along the lines you have suggested. Our tentative
                        conclusion is that these arrangements are basically sound and can
                        effectively deter Communist encroachment in the area. We do intend, however,
                        to take steps to improve their practical effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that your Government is already making a significant
                        contribution to assist the valiant people of South Vietnam, and we believe
                        that there may be additional areas for cooperation between your Government
                        and the Government of the Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. President, I should like to reiterate the view endorsed by
                        President Kennedy in March, 1962, that the United States would regard with
                        great satisfaction developments on mainland China in which freedom might be
                        restored to the Chinese people. I hope that through further close
                        consultation and planning our Governments can agree on actions which will
                        demonstrate to people everywhere the inevitable defeat of Communist
                        aggression. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> will
                        discuss these matters with you when he visits Taipei in April.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0063"/>
                    <p>I recall my visit to Taiwan with great pleasure. I hope that your health
                        continues to be excellent and that Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> has
                        recovered safely from her recent illness.</p>

                        international position citing EEC, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Senegal, Congo,
                        (Brazzaville) and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>President then asked what was meant by statement in President
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>'s letter that “there may be additional
                        areas for cooperation" between <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I responded with substance of para G, <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 812 on subject of financial assistance and land reform,
                        saying I believed this probably represented part of what President
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> had in mind, although I had been given no
                        interpretation.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether he was correct in inferring US was not in favor
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> sending a representative to Viet-Nam
                        at present to discuss possibility of alliance as we had suggested he do with
                        respect Seoul.</p>
                    <p>I repeated our view that situation in Viet-Nam is too sensitive at present
                        for such action and we hoped he would defer undertaking any such
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>I told President that I had reported to Washington what Foreign Minister
                            <persName>Shen</persName> had told me March 8 concerning difficult
                        situation faced by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in Brazzaville. We
                        hoped <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would find it possible to keep
                        mission there until situation clarified. If withdrawal should be considered
                        advisable, we hoped onus could be placed on Brazzaville and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would closely consult with us on steps
                        considered necessary. I then read to him <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>'s 833.<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">Dated March 9.

                    </p>
                    <p>President said he had nothing particular to say at this time. He believed he
                        understood the meaning of what I had told him and asked whether the
                        Secretary was definitely coming on April 16.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I had reported that the President would be glad to see him on
                        April 16 and I believed that he was now definitely planning to come.</p>
                    <p>President said that matter we had discussed could be gone into fully with the

                    <p>Dear Bill: I am sure you are familiar with the “Blue Lion" Committee
                        organized for the purpose of examining Chinese capability plans for
                        operations against the mainland under conditions of a mainland uprising. The
                        Committee was specifically excluded from examining plans for employment of
                        U.S. forces in support except for Taiwan defense.</p>
                    <p>The Blue Lion Committee work has been largely responsible for getting across
                        to the President and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> a factual and
                        realistic evaluation of their chances of success in such operations. This
                        realization has resulted in the relatively quiescent period of propaganda
                        and effort by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in “mainland recovery"
                        plans and for this reason has done a splendid job.</p>
                    <p>Recently the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, entirely on their own
                        initiative, has expanded their planning to operations against Hainan Island.
                        This goes beyond the Blue Lion terms of reference inasmuch as their plans
                        assume: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>To clarify the situation I called a meeting of the Blue Lion Committee and
                        have attached hereto the minutes of the meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">The meeting is recorded in an enclosed March 27 memorandum of

                        make it clear the Chinese Communists are responsible for any break or
                        interruption in talks and that the US, in its search for a peaceful
                        settlement of dispute, has been willing and continues willing explore every
                        avenue to this end. We welcome Warsaw talks as effort reduce tension in Far
                        East and lessen threat of war. As relevant to situation, you authorized make
                        statement to press along above lines. If you are asked by press for US
                        position on continuation of talks, merely state US awaiting word from

                            participate. Wanted to review Chinese efforts over nearly nine years he
                            has been representing his government in talks. Said his side had made
                            five reasonable proposals for relaxation tension, on October 27 and
                            December 1, 1955, on May 11, 1956, and on September 15 and September 22,
                            1958. In addition his side presented series of draft agreements designed
                            remove obstacles to trade and travel, exchange newsmen, promote judicial
                            systems and lifting nuclear threat from China. Today he wanted present
                            yet one more effort his side in form of draft agreed announcement (text

                            between words and deeds noted during my Shanghai service, record of

                            would eventually triumph in entire world it was matter for given country
                            to decide whether its revolution should be violent or not. No foreign
                            country can ever concoct revolution in another country nor can
                            revolution in given country be stopped from outside. Claimed one
                            principle in foreign policy his government called for peaceful

                            dispute between China and US must be settled and he saw no other way

                            which would involve great political costs or high military risks.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Direct action against the Chinese Communist nuclear facilities would,
                            at best, put them out of operation for a few years (perhaps four to
                            five).</item>

                            Threat of action in response to a specific instance of actual or
                            threatened Chinese aggression would be preferable to a general threat,
                            but would also have significant disadvantages. Whether it would be
                            desirable would depend a good deal upon the circumstances surrounding a
                            particular situation. If, for example, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s were threatening nuclear action, a threatened
                            response limited initially to nuclear production facilities might be

                            preferable to actions directed against nuclear facilities alone.
                            Similarly, threats designed to deter <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> action should probably not be directed solely
                            against nuclear facilities. (However, as stated in par. 3 there may be
                            circumstances in which action limited to nuclear facilities may be
                            preferred.)</item>

                        <item>It seems most unlikely that we can develop, through negotiations in

                            helping lay the political basis for such action. But arms control
                            negotiations can further isolate the Chinese on this issue and can thus
                            help prepare the way for possible action taken in other ways and on
                            other grounds against the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            facilities.</item>

                        <item>Covert action seems to offer the politically most feasible form of
                            action. Such action would present least problems if undertaken as part
                            of a reaction to Chinese Communist aggression. Political costs of action
                            in the absence of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggression
                            are difficult to estimate. They could be considerable if Peiping reacts
                            strongly; small, if it does not. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source

                        <item>There are a number of technical and technical-related questions which
                            would require an answer before a decision for any of the possible forms

                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>It is doubtful whether, even with completion of initial
                                    photographic coverage of the mainland, we will have anything
                                    like complete assurance that we will have identified all
                                    significant nuclear installations. Thus, even “successful"
                                    action may not necessarily prevent the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s from detonating a
                                    nuclear device in the next few years. If an attack should be
                                    made, some installations are missed and Communist China
                                    subsequently demonstrates that it is continuing to produce
                                    nuclear weapons, what is likely to be the reaction to the

                                <item>It seems to be the case that a relatively heavy non-nuclear
                                    air attack would be required to put installations “permanently"
                                    out of business (i.e., destroy them so completely that any
                                    rebuilding effort would have to start virtually from scratch).
                                    If complete destruction is unattainable without a large attack,

                    <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, the President remarked that the time was
                        short and suggested that the Secretary open the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Sino-Soviet Dispute</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he appreciated the opportunity of meeting with
                        the President and wanted to hear him speak on the questions that were on his
                        mind. But, the Secretary said, at the top of his own mind now was the
                        feeling that we were at the beginning of large events in the world. The
                        situation was beginning to show mobility. It was too early to see what the
                        final results of this would be, but it appeared that important changes were
                        in the making. He therefore very much wanted to discuss with President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> what was going on inside the Communist
                        world, the implications of the dispute between Peiping and Moscow, and what
                        all this means to the security problems which we and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> have in the Western Pacific.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the quarrel between Moscow and Peiping seems to us very
                        deep. Personal relations between <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        and Khrushchev could not be worse. They were using stronger language about
                        each other than the Communists had ever used regarding free world
                        leaders.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0076"/>
                    <p>In one sense this was a quarrel over the leadership of the Communist world,
                        but it also affected state relations, border problems, trade and security
                        questions. It must, of course, be kept in mind that it is always possible
                        for two dictators to reverse their positions completely and come together as
                        Hitler and Stalin had done prior to the Second World War. In another sense,
                        the Moscow-Peiping dispute may be a family quarrel which may not affect
                        relations with the free world. If one or the other came into military
                        conflict with the free world, there was still a question whether either
                        could afford not to support the other. This is a question we cannot yet
                        answer. However, we may get the answer in the course of this year.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he knew the President had given a great deal of
                        thought and study to Soviet affairs, including recent developments between
                        Peiping and Moscow and would be much interested in hearing the President's
                        analysis of the situation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the Secretary had briefly outlined two possibilities.
                        First, that Peiping and Moscow might each go its own way, and second, that
                        this was a family quarrel and the two might come together again. Which
                        development did the Secretary consider most likely?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he frankly didn't know the answer to that
                        question. As late as yesterday Khrushchev had said that this quarrel would
                        bring no benefit to the free world and that the Communist bloc would come
                        out of it stronger than ever. U.S. experts on Communist affairs believe that
                        the dispute goes much deeper than personal relationships. It involves party
                        relations, ideology, state relations and questions relating to nuclear
                        weapons. This combination of differences points in the direction of a
                        complete break. However, the Secretary said he didn't think we could predict
                        now what would happen. The whole problem of what to do about the dispute is
                        now being discussed within the Soviet world. There is a great reluctance to
                        permit a complete break to occur. A complete break would be a great
                        advantage to the free world, but we cannot yet say what will happen.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was glad that the Secretary had mentioned Khrushchev's
                        statement. He said his own general yardstick for interpreting Communist
                        statements was to look for the opposite meaning from what was said. If the
                        Communists alleged there would be no split, then there probably would be
                        one. The words of Communist leaders cannot be taken at face value. The more
                        they talk in terms of possible rapprochement, the more likely there is to be
                        continued conflict.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was also significant that Khrushchev should have
                        referred to his conflict with <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> as
                        a family affair. Historically Communists would rather compromise with an
                        outside enemy than one inside the party. The cases of Trotsky, Hitler and
                        Molotov all demonstrated this. A struggle inside the party would be fought
                        out to the very <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0077"/>end. The President
                        concluded that since the Secretary had indicated to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> that he would like to discuss
                        Sino-Soviet affairs, he had put down some of his ideas in writing, and would
                        have an English translation read (see Document A attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">See A–942 attached—Tab 2, page 3. [Footnote in the

                            Ministry had provided to the Embassy. The four documents that
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> and his interpreter read during this
                            session were incorporated into the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that these were interesting observations concerning
                        the largest problem we had before us in the world today. He inquired whether
                        there was any evidence of traditional regional differences within the
                        Peiping regime, or was the leadership relatively united?</p>
                    <p>Possibility of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Operations Against China
                        Mainland</p>
                    <p>The President responded that there were ample signs of distrust among middle
                        echelon cadres in the provinces toward the Central Government. There was not
                        the same degree of confidence as before between the regions and the Central
                        Government, but things were kept under control by stringent measures. The
                        President said he knew that within the central leadership a small number of
                        persons had come increasingly in recent years to distrust <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, but there was still no outward
                        manifestation of this.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that elementary arithmetic demonstrates that the problem
                        of feeding the Chinese people is becoming more difficult year by year. The
                        situation must eventually develop to the point where these strains will
                        become almost impossible to handle.</p>
                    <p>The President said this was but one of the Communists' numerous weaknesses.
                        In addition to economic weakness, there were political and social weaknesses
                        too numerous to cite. There were also signs of wavering and disloyalty
                        within the armed forces, whose rations were being steadily reduced.</p>
                    <p>As evidence of differences within the regime, the President referred to the
                        liquidation of Kao Kang and Jao Shu-shih, and the opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> of Peng Te-huai and his associates.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>, the present Chief of
                        Staff of the armed forces, was practically paralyzed by illness. The
                        President said he knew that <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> in
                        his heart was opposed to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> was a graduate of the fourth
                        class of the Whampoa Academy, where he had been a classmate of General Liu
                        An-chi, commander of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Army. During
                        the Japanese War, <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> had lived for
                        some time in Chungking.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would like to comment on the question of possible
                        operations against the mainland which the President had raised. He would
                        like to repeat his opening remark that we were at the beginning of a period
                        of great change and could not be certain what the outcome would be. But his
                        judgment today would be that in the face of the large <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0078"/>Chinese Communist forces on the mainland the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could not establish itself
                        militarily on the mainland without large-scale assistance from other
                        countries, particularly the United States, and involving U.S. military
                        forces and possibly nuclear weapons. He said, if he had to make a judgment
                        today—who knows what might happen in six months—he would say that Khrushchev
                        would have to support <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>. This
                        could lead to the whole Northern Hemisphere going up in flames.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the Secretary said it was essential to follow most closely the
                        Sino-Soviet dispute because of its implications for the security situation
                        in Asia, as well as Europe, Africa and Latin America. If either Khrushchev
                        or <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> should die the situation
                        could change suddenly and dramatically. There might be a complete reshaping
                        and realignment of the situation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was opposed in principle to the use of nuclear
                        weapons, particularly in settling the China problem. He didn't want to give
                        the impression that he was advocating immediate action against the mainland.
                        He had a concept he would like to explore. It was not his intention to
                        request U.S. aid to go back to the mainland right away.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it was important for the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to keep in close touch in assessing the
                        situation so as not to miss an opportunity which might be provided by the
                        rapidly changing situation. Think of the difference if the free world had
                        done what was needed in China in 1931! Subsequent history would have been
                        entirely changed.</p>
                    <p>The President said, as he had stated, he had a concept as to how to proceed
                        against the China mainland which he would have read in English translation
                        (see Document B attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">See A–942 attached—Tab
                            2, page 8. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that these were very important and far reaching
                        proposals. He was sure the President would not wish him to comment on them
                        offhand, as they were deserving of careful study. The Secretary went on to
                        say that the reason he had asked the President about the possible existence
                        of regional differences within the Communist regime was related to the
                        President's own interest in South China. A major crisis could develop with
                        Communist China in Southeast Asia. He wanted to tell the President seriously
                        that if the situation in Vietnam deteriorated, the United States course of
                        action would not be to pull out, but to take additional measures. These
                        additional measures might very well involve danger and damage to South
                        China. In view of the pressing internal economic problems in South China,
                        perhaps something could be offered if that area wished to pursue a policy of
                        peace. A combination of opportunity, pressure and danger might cause South
                        China to break <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0079"/>away and cooperate
                        with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The Secretary said he didn't
                        know whether this was possible, but these are things we should be thinking
                        about.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that he felt very strongly that without the active
                        participation of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> no movement in
                        China's southern provinces could arise. The people in these provinces might
                        suffer from bombing and other measures, but the end result would only be
                        more hatred of the United States rather than a move for independence. The
                        key factor would be participation of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had mentioned earlier that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would need U.S. support and assistance in initiating a
                        large-scale anti-Communist movement on the mainland. Opportunities must be
                        created rather than waited for. Guerrilla activity in certain provinces
                        needed to be started. All this must be done first. Any help given by the
                        United States would involve no risk to the United States. The President felt
                        opportunities could be created in the southwest provinces bordering Vietnam,
                        Laos, Thailand, Burma and India. This area was too far away for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to take any interest in and therefore
                        there should be no concern regarding Soviet intervention. The President then
                        said he would like to know exactly what U.S. policy, strategy and tactics
                        were in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">U.S. Policy in South Vietnam</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the most immediate purpose is to help South
                        Vietnam deal with the Viet Cong insurrection which is supported by and to
                        some extent supplied by North Vietnam. We estimate there are 25 to 30
                        thousand hard core Viet Cong and 60 to 70 thousand irregulars. The Viet Cong
                        have more strength than these numbers would indicate because they interfere
                        through terror with the villagers' cooperation with the government. They
                        come by night, terrorize the villages and leave the people fearful of
                        cooperating with the government. North Vietnam is providing four types of
                        assistance to the Viet Cong. These are (1) full support in stimulating and
                        agitating through political and propaganda means to try to create the
                        impression that the Viet Cong are the winning side. (2) We have very good
                        information demonstrating that the operating control of the Viet Cong forces
                        is centered in Hanoi. (3) Relatively small numbers of cadres are being
                        infiltrated from the north into the south. Last year perhaps 1800 of such
                        highly trained individuals were sent. Each is worth 25 to 30 times his own
                        weight because of his ability to train and organize local bands. (4) The
                        north is also supplying relatively modest amounts of arms, particularly some
                        of the most sophisticated weapons introduced to deal with the tactics of the
                        Vietnam Army. These include anti-aircraft machine guns for use against
                        helicopters, a few 75 mm recoil-less rifles and communications equipment.
                        Arms are not being supplied in large amounts. Most arms used by the <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0080"/>Viet Cong come from the stock of
                        English, French, Chinese, U.S. and other weapons accumulated over the past
                        20 years.</p>
                    <p>Vietnamese Government forces are much larger than the Viet Cong forces,
                        consisting of 200,000 regular troops and 170,000 irregulars. Government
                        forces have superior weapons and equipment, mobility and unlimited economic
                        support. Nevertheless, their task is very difficult because they need not
                        only to deal with the Viet Cong but also to pacify areas. The Viet Cong hit
                        and run tactics are very hard to cope with.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected “You say, in other words, the Chinese Communists
                        are not directly involved?“</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that no Chinese Communist personnel had ever been found
                        in South Vietnam. There was not even evidence of large numbers of Chinese
                        Communist military or technicians in North Vietnam. Some weapons had been
                        captured which were made in China in 1959, 1960 and 1961, but there was no
                        evidence of direct Chinese Communist involvement in South Vietnam at
                        present.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary referred to the substantial Chinese community in South Vietnam
                        and said we were very grateful for the work the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had done with this community. There might be a few of these
                        people who have been influenced by Peiping, but on the whole, they support
                        the government and are no problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we were trying very hard on the political front to
                        deny Laos as an infiltration route from North to South Vietnam. All
                        signatories to the 1962 agreements on Laos agreed that Laos would not be
                        used as an avenue for this purpose. Of course, this agreement has been
                        violated. We have been working with the signatory countries trying to get
                        compliance with the agreements. If Laos could be stabilized the situation in
                        Vietnam could be improved. Not all of our action is political. We are also
                        engaged in certain activities on the ground to increase the difficulty of
                        using Laos as a route to South Vietnam. Not all of these activities appear
                        in the press. We are working very hard on this problem.</p>
                    <p>The President said with regard to the situation in South Vietnam, the
                        important thing is to know the real enemy. The enemy is not the Viet Cong in
                        South Vietnam, but the Communists in North Vietnam. This must be recognized
                        before tactics to be used can even be discussed. To move a step further, we
                        should know that the real masters of North Vietnam are the Chinese
                        Communists. They pull the strings. If there were no Chinese Communist regime
                        on the mainland there would be no North Vietnam, and if there were no North
                        Vietnam there would be no Viet Cong. Regarding the question of how to win
                        the war in Vietnam, the President said he had put his thoughts down in a
                        paper which he asked be read (see Document C attached).<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">See A–942 attached—Tab 2, page 11. [Footnote in the

                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> said she understood the strategic hamlets
                        had not been very successful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it depended on the area. In the south the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had tried to go too far too fast. Its
                        tactics were now being changed. The Secretary assured the President that his
                        suggestions would be given very careful study. The United States was deeply
                        concerned regarding the security of Southeast Asia. We could assure the
                        President that we did know who our real enemies were. A great deal of sober
                        thought would be given to this problem in the weeks ahead, and as the
                        President knew, he was himself going to Saigon the next day for a first-hand
                        look. He said we would be in touch with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> concerning the President's suggestions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that since World War II the United States had taken
                        over 160,000 casualties in the cold war against the Communists, most of
                        these in the Far East. We are not going to deal with large masses of men on
                        the Asia mainland with conventional U.S. forces. We cannot ask that of our
                        people. This means frightful destruction if the United States becomes
                        involved militarily in this area. Consequently, we are not prepared to move
                        too far or too fast in the direction of precipitating that kind of war. It
                        may be that Southeast Asia cannot be made secure unless the Chinese
                        Communists are hurt and hurt badly, but this would build up a legacy of hate
                        against the United States. Even many of those who hate Castro advise us not
                        to invade Cuba and kill 40 or 50 thousand Cubans, because of the scar this
                        would leave on our relations with Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he could not quarrel with the President's identification
                        of the enemy and his analysis of cause and effect. The question is, at what
                        point do we face up to the costs involved, costs which may be frightful?
                        This we must consider most carefully.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had earlier indicated his objection to the use of
                        nuclear weapons in this part of the world. He was also sure that other
                        people in this area would object. Their use was wholly unnecessary.
                        Vietnamese manpower should be used in Vietnam, and Chinese manpower in
                        China. U.S. military manpower would not be required. Even to think of using
                        nuclear weapons was open to question. It was unwise. It would hurt the
                        United States more than anything else and it was unnecessary. He said he was
                        speaking very frankly to an ally and his desire was to be helpful.<note n="6" xml:id="d26fn6">This is apparently the exchange that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> described in As I Saw It, pp.

                    <p>The President added that it was for the sake of the real interests of the

                    <p>The President said he had taken into consideration the real interests of the
                        United States. He hoped the criticism would be taken in the spirit it was
                        offered, as the views of a friend. He wanted to emphasize that only the
                        armed forces of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could liquidate the
                        Chinese Communists (see Document D attached).<note n="7" xml:id="d26fn7">See

                    </p>
                    <p>The President said he was afraid he had overdone his criticism. The Secretary
                        replied that he took no offense, because the President's criticisms were
                        directed at some very fundamental questions. He said the United States does
                        not want to take any action on behalf of others if others are able to take
                        care of their own independence and security. If you scratch the skin of any
                        American you find beneath it an isolationist who would rather be home than
                        anywhere else, but we feel we have learned since 1931 that aggression, if
                        unchecked, becomes a threat to all, and free peoples must stand together to
                        resist it. It was not until 1948–1949 that we began really to learn the
                        lesson of the period beginning in 1931. We now have 48 allies in various
                        parts of the world. Yet we don't control one of them. Sometimes we have the
                        feeling that others control us.</p>
                    <p>The President said the Secretary must not misunderstand. It was Chinese
                        Communist propaganda which alleged that the United States controlled the
                        policies and actions of others. Take, for example, the United States
                        presence in Taiwan. The United States certainly did not control things here,
                        but this was the Communist propaganda line and it was sometimes taken
                        seriously. Neither did the President have the slightest intention of
                        suggesting that the United States return to isolationism. The world needs
                        the United States, but the United States need not be directly involved in
                        fighting. It should support others to do the fighting.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that it seems to be present U.S. policy to help
                        nations fighting Communism to maintain the status quo. This indirectly
                        enables Communist regimes to maintain control of the people. The resentment
                        of the people that the U.S. is taking no steps to free them is bound to
                        increase. Chinese Communist propaganda can then exploit this resentment
                        against the United States by accusing the United States of aggression.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if what the President had in mind was the capability
                        of engaging in military action against the Communists without U.S.
                        participation, this needed to be looked at with great professional <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0083"/>competence to determine the
                        capability. However, the United States cannot escape responsibility for
                        assisting such action. No United States Government could accept supporting
                        such an action and then backing away in the face of failure.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was glad to hear the Secretary's comments. To make a
                        long story short, the results would depend upon U.S. policy and the methods
                        employed. He hoped in the evening to have an opportunity to discuss the
                        matter further. He also wanted to take up certain questions which President
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> had said in his letter could be taken up
                        with the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed his appreciation at the great thought which the
                        President had put into his preparation for today's meeting</p>

                    <p>After dinner the President opened the conversation by stating that one point
                        President <persName>Johnson</persName> in his letter had said might be
                        discussed with the Secretary was the matter of the proposals made by
                        President <persName>Chiang</persName> for alliances among anti-Communist
                        nations in the Far East.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Alliance of Anti-Communist Far Eastern Nations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said on that matter he had no final, categorical views. Things
                        were in motion. It was relevant to observe that the United States <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0084"/>has alliances with the Republic of China,
                        the Republic of Korea and, in effect, the Republic of Vietnam, which was a
                        protocol state under the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty. We
                        are inclined to believe that joint action by these three powers is only
                        likely to become effective should there be a general war with mainland
                        China. Under such circumstances, the United States presumably would be a
                        party. The Secretary didn't quite see what the three powers could do without
                        the United States. Of course, the U.S. was grateful for certain assistance
                        which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was providing to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and he expected to discuss this matter
                        further in Saigon. He thought it unlikely that the Senate would permit the
                        United States to join another alliance arrangement in the Far East. Without
                        United States' participation, whether such an arrangement could be effective
                        was a matter for consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in connection with their common enemy, Communist
                        China, there was real substance in an arrangement between the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and Korea. Both had substantial,
                        well-trained forces which would make a real difference in a struggle with
                        Communist China. He doubted that Vietnam could contribute much. The question
                        now was what could be done to help Vietnam. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did not want foreign combat troops, not even from the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>The President said he recognized the existence of the bilateral U.S. treaties
                        and he knew that the proposed tripartite arrangement might not mean much in
                        practical terms. Nevertheless, it would mean much psychologically to the
                        people concerned and would serve to counter Communist China's treaties with
                        North Korea and North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Effect on Asia of Chinese Communist Nuclear Explosion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired what the President's views were concerning the effect
                        on Asia should the Chinese Communists explode a nuclear device by the end of
                        this year or next. He was not thinking of the military significance of such
                        an event because it would be many years before Peiping could develop any
                        significant nuclear power and the United States had plenty of nuclear force
                        to counter it. What he was wondering about was the psychological effect of
                        such an event. It might be necessary to take additional steps to counter
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The President said that on the basis of information at the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s disposal he did not believe that the
                        Communists would be able to explode a nuclear device in the next three to
                        five years. Of course, he said, it is necessary to be prepared for that
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Alliance of Anti-Communist Far Eastern Nations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Reverting again to the alliance, the President said this would be a good
                        thing in the light of French recognition of Peiping and it would result in
                        strengthening the confidence in the future of the people in this area.</p>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0085"/>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired what was the attitude of the other two countries
                        toward an alliance.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the South Koreans were most enthusiastic. He said
                        it was they who first brought up the idea. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has had some talks with the Koreans on this subject but not
                        with the Vietnamese. He had brought the matter up only for the Secretary's
                        reference and because he wanted to coordinate his action with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would not wish to say at this time that we are opposed
                        to such an alliance. It would have to be studied further. There are, of
                        course, other important countries in this area such as Japan, Thailand and
                        the Philippines. We have given tentative thought to ways in which closer
                        relations can be established among the anti-Communist countries of the
                        western Pacific. In the North Atlantic there is the North Atlantic
                        community. Would it be possible to establish in the Pacific a Pacific
                        community? Naturally, he meant a community excluding Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The President said all would be in favor of such a community but there was a
                        question as to how to obtain Japanese participation. The Japanese
                        constitution prohibited participation in any form of alliance. Furthermore,
                        Japan was heavily infiltrated with leftists, who could at any moment mount a
                        demonstration against such a project.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said, regarding the possible explosion of a nuclear device by
                        Peiping, the Soviets' estimate agreed with that of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. We knew that the Chinese Communists had
                        had a plutonium plant in operation for some time and thought it possible
                        that they might be able to detonate a device this year or next. However, we
                        hoped the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> estimate was correct. If the
                        Chinese Communists did explode a device, we might see a rapid evolution in
                        Japanese policy, as the Japanese would see this development in Communist
                        China as a major threat to them.</p>
                    <p>The President said that his view of possible Japanese reaction to the
                        explosion of a nuclear device by the Chinese Communists was the opposite of
                        the Secretary's. He thought it might cause the Japanese to move away from
                        the Free World.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Japanese were aware of the enormous nuclear power
                        possessed by the United States and would not dare to move to the side of its
                        enemies.</p>
                    <p>The President said he found the Secretary's comments very interesting and
                        hoped some day they might be able to discuss them again.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">U.S. Nuclear Strength</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wanted to impress upon the President the almost
                        unimaginable power in nuclear weapons possessed by the United States. He
                        said we cannot take too much comfort in this, because it is almost unusable.
                        However, he wanted the President to understand <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0086"/>the order of magnitude of U.S. nuclear power in order to
                        reassure him and also to help him understand why we were reluctant to risk a
                        general war which the human race might not survive.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that he thought the Soviet Union knew this only too
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that Khrushchev knew it but Mao did not.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in his opinion the likelihood of nuclear war was
                        remote because of this realization on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviet Union would not dare to take
                        on the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the problem was one of rationality. If people
                        could remain rational, of course, they would not do so, but the question
                        was, at what point does irrationality take over?</p>
                    <p>The President indicated he appreciated this point.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Warsaw Talks</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was one point on which he wanted to be very clear
                        and direct so there could be no misunderstanding. This concerned the talks
                        in Warsaw. These talks were initiated by President Eisenhower and Secretary
                        Dulles because they had an obligation to U.S. citizens held prisoner on the
                        China mainland. We felt an obligation to attempt to get them released. For
                        seven years these talks have had a single pattern. Peiping says the United
                        States must get out of Taiwan and turn the island over to Peiping. We say we
                        cannot do this. This has become a sort of phonograph record which is
                        repeated over and over.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he could assure the President that we were not negotiating
                        with Peiping for a detente, for trade, or for recognition of the Peiping
                        regime. He understood that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was
                        unhappy about the existence of the talks. He could understand this. The
                        talks would now be suspended for several months as Wang was being
                        transferred. He wanted to assure the President that nothing was going on
                        between the United States and Peiping that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> didn't know about.</p>
                    <p>The President said he doesn't feel unduly exercised about the matter. He
                        knows that there is nothing in the talks. Nevertheless, he hopes they will
                        be discontinued. The man in the street doesn't know what is going on and
                        these talks boosted the prestige of the Chinese Communist regime,
                        particularly after French recognition. The Chinese Communists' propaganda
                        machine takes full advantage of the situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we have similar problems elsewhere. For example, two
                        Americans were shot down in a helicopter and are held by the North Koreans.
                        The United States public demands that we get them back. So we go to
                        Panmunjom and talk with the North Koreans about it. As for the Warsaw talks,
                        there would be none for several months and we will keep in touch with the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> concerning them.</p>
                    <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0087"/>
                    <p>The President said he was not himself at all exercised about the talks. He
                        knows the United States cannot possibly reach a compromise with the Chinese
                        Communists. If the United States really wanted to do so, it would not have
                        to so publicly. There are many other ways.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the talks have served a useful purpose. When people
                        accuse the United States Government of being too harsh and inflexible on the
                        Chinese question, we just point to the record of the Chinese Communist
                        position in the Warsaw talks. There it is in the record for seven years.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President repeated that he had full confidence in the United States. He
                        went on to say that another matter he was not losing sleep over was the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s position in the United Nations.
                        President <persName>Johnson</persName> had called for an intensive effort to
                        support that position and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was
                        prepared to do all it could. At the same time he had absolute confidence in
                        the United States' determination to support the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the principal battle would be in the General Assembly. He
                        was not concerned about the Security Council. A number of countries which
                        had recognized Peiping still supported the position that the seating of
                        Peiping in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was an important question.
                        The British, for example, had been very helpful. He was reasonably
                        optimistic that the position could be held in the General Assembly, and this
                        is where difficulties might be encountered. However, we both must continue
                        to work hard.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Shen</persName> inquired whether the Secretary was referring to
                        the situation this fall, and the Secretary replied he was and to the next
                        two or three years.</p>
                    <p>The President said he thinks the Chinese Communists are predominately
                        interested in the Security Council and not in being seated in the General
                        Assembly, as such. Unless they can be seated in the Security Council, they
                        are not interested in getting into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                        Therefore, we must pay attention to the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was not absolutely convinced that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> really wants the Chinese Communists in.
                        Sometimes they played their hand with great awkwardness, as if they wished
                        to lose.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he personally feels assured that so long as the U.S.
                        is determined to keep the Chinese Communists out, they will not be able to
                        get in. However, ordinary people see that three out of the five permanent
                        members of the Security Council now recognize Peiping and feel that their
                        side no longer has the upper hand.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he realized there had been certain differences
                        between the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and Japan. There were also
                        differences between the <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0088"/>United States
                        and Japan. He hoped the President would realize how very helpful Japan had
                        been to the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                        supporting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position. The U.S. had been an occupying power in Japan, but
                        we were no longer in that position and could not command the Japanese. There
                        were some policies on which we and they did not agree. We hoped the
                        President realized that for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to lose
                        Japanese friendship and support would be a very serious thing. We hoped the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and Japan could find a way to
                        compose their differences.</p>
                    <p>The President said he understood the question very well and appreciated the
                        Secretary's remarks. He understood the importance of Japan's support for the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s international position. Had the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> severed relations with Japan, it
                        would be even more isolated than by the French action. He said that so long
                        as the Japanese did not actually aid the Chinese Communists, he would try to
                        work for improved relations. Since the Yoshida visit to Taiwan, the
                        atmosphere in this respect had improved.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we are constantly in touch with the Japanese and we have
                        discussed this problem with Ikeda. We will continue to pay close attention
                        to it.</p>
                    <p>In taking leave of the President, the Secretary said he was grateful for this
                        exchange of views which he thought had strengthened and further developed
                        the close relationship which had grown up over many years between the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>

                            stated that he relied on the promise President Kennedy had made that in

                            the Chinese Communists out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. You
                            later assured the President that although there had been a change of

                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> briefly discussed

                                paper on the Republic of China; <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> thought it was “not much of a paper" and that
                                “now is just not the time to decide policy on China.” At the April
                                17 meeting, <persName>Bundy</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> to tell
                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> not to seek approval of the policy
                                paper on China because it “would raise more problems than it would
                                solve, particularly this year.” (Memoranda for the Record by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>, April 15 and 17;
                                ibid.)</note> Some people believe that if the paper can be agreed
                            to, it will not say much, and thus hardly will be worth the effort.
                            There are others who believe that if there is sharp disagreement over
                            the paper, focusing on the issue of the Offshore Islands, the whole
                            matter might become a campaign issue.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The government faces a basic dilemma with respect to the policy papers. If
                        they can be used as campaign fodder, that is not good; and everyone feels
                        they will be leaked if they have potential political value. On the other
                        hand, it would be equally unwise for the White House to send the word out
                        that no one is to do any thinking for the next year.</p>
                    <p>This dilemma was openly recognized at the meeting, and some discussion
                        resulted on ways to deal with the matter. There was general agreement that
                        it would be very useful, and indeed almost necessary, for the government to
                        focus on policies and programs for use by the government in 1965. These
                        papers would, of course, be useful to either the same or a new
                        Administration. Cooper would handle this problem by setting small study
                        groups to deal with particular problems. He was virtually the only one,
                        however, who believed such work could be kept secret. Amory suggested that
                        perhaps the groups like the Council of Foreign Relations could be useful.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>, who believed that the Council suffered
                        essentially from the same inhibitions as the government in either getting a
                        small group together or in keeping the discussion secret, preferred a more
                        informal approach. He is thinking in terms of isolating some problem areas,
                        e.g.—Cuba, East-West trade, perhaps China—for discussions among selected
                        individuals. He wants problems that seem manageable and people that are
                        knowledgeable. He asked the staff for any suggestions on either that they
                        might have.</p>
                    <p>Brubeck made an interesting point when he said that what often starts out as
                        a new look at an old policy often ends up with the people who support
                        existing policy being provided another opportunity to get a restatement.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> added that not only was that true, but that
                        for most high level people in government, you could tell what door they
                        would come out of by watching which one they went in.</p>
                    <p>One other point worth mentioning came up. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> and <persName>Bundy</persName> both believe the
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> paper on the consequences of a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear capability<pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0091"/>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Reference is apparently to an undated paper

                        they are probably right since they are in a key position to influence our
                        reaction. In the discussion today, however, the only consequence was that it
                        seems clear the matter will be looked at again.</p>

                    <p rend="center">I. Summary and Key Issues</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Timing and Character. A first nuclear test could occur any time; it is
                            likely to be in late 1964 or later. With their one known plutonium
                            reactor, the ChiComs could produce only one or two crude weapons per
                            year. A substantial program would require completion of a plant started
                            with earlier Soviet assistance. While initial nuclear delivery means may
                            be obsolescent aircraft, the Chinese are apparently concentrating on
                            medium-range missiles.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Military Effects. The ChiComs have demonstrated prudence in the use of
                            military force. Their capability will be more important for its
                            political-psychological than for its direct military effects—primarily
                            because of the great disparity between U.S. and Chinese nuclear
                            capabilities <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0092"/>and vulnerabilities.
                            The Chinese could eventually do significant, but not crippling, damage
                            to U.S. forces in Asia, while the U.S. will have the ability to destroy
                            Communist China. This makes Chinese first-use of nuclear weapons
                            unlikely—unless the regime were already threatened with destruction—and
                            greatly reduces the credibility of its nuclear capability as a
                            deterrent. A limited ChiCom intercontinental capability would not
                            eliminate this basic disparity.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Political-Psychological Effects. The ChiComs will hope that their
                            nuclear capability will weaken the will of countries resisting
                            insurgency; inhibit requests for U.S. assistance; put political pressure
                            on the U.S. military presence in Asia; and muster support for Chinese
                            claims to great power status. They may hope that it will deter us in
                            situations where our interests seem only marginally threatened.</item>

                            action proposals are developed in another paper. Policy issues include
                            the following: <list>

                                <item>Military posture. Does the Sino-Soviet split deprive Communist
                                    China of the Soviet nuclear umbrella and make a lower U.S.
                                    nuclear threshold a desirable policy in Asia? Dependence upon
                                    nuclear weapons should not increase. Future emphasis should be
                                    upon dual-capable and seaborne forces.</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>Pre-emptive Military Action. Would military action against
                                    ChiCom nuclear facilities be desirable? Would be undesirable
                                    except possibly as part of general action against the mainland
                                    in response to major <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>

                                <item>Nuclear Proliferation. What U.S. actions might reduce the
                                    likelihood of development of additional national nuclear
                                    capabilities (e.g., by India)? No combination of actions may be
                                    adequate; the following offer best prospects: (i) broad public
                                    declaration of willingness to provide nuclear defense; (ii)
                                    assurances to allies under existing security commitments; (iii)
                                    offers to neutrals of declaratory commitment to consult; (iv)
                                    offers to engage in bilateral planning for nuclear defense; (v)
                                    offers to deploy nuclear weapons in event of nuclear threats;
                                    (vi) exploration of possible forms of joint declarations with
                                    Soviets.</item>

                                <item>Additional Assurances. If the ChiComs exploit both the sense
                                    of threat and the desire for peace, what other U.S. actions
                                    might provide relevant assurance to Asian states? Such actions
                                    as deployment of mobile air defense units to advance bases in
                                    Asia; stimulation of Asian military and non-military
                                    cooperation; selective token increases in military assistance;
                                    positive statement of U.S. interest in involving Communist China
                                    in disarmament negotiations; development of Asian components of
                                    our arms control plan; etc.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bill:</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communist shelling of Matsu on May 16, which clearly seems to
                        have been a reaction to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> artillery fire
                        from Matsu covering a raiding party launched from Matsu against Lienchiang
                        (FCT 8622), caused me to give consideration to repeating to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> the warning we gave them last spring that
                        they should not assume the US would assist the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should the Chicoms attack the smaller offshore islands in
                        retaliation for raids mounted by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        from such islands. (Dept's <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>-10363, March
                        22, 1963, and Embassy's A–1091, June 21, 1963.)<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>While the raid in question was not launched from one of the smaller offshore
                        islands, some of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s recent raids have
                        been launched from Tungyin. Of course, these have not been of the size that
                        we were afraid the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might launch last
                        spring, nor has there been any evidence that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is deliberately seeking to provoke a Chinese Communist
                        reaction against the offshore islands. On the contrary, the lack of success
                        of the raids appears to have deterred the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> for the present from any further activity in that general
                        area (FCT 8622).</p>
                    <p>I assume our policy continues to be to oppose any action which might heighten
                        the risk of the US becoming involved in military action in the Taiwan
                        Straits area. We have not objected to the small scale raids the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been running recently and I do not
                        believe actions on that scale significantly increase the risk of a Chinese
                        Communist reaction which would involve the US. However, if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should continue to use Tung-yin or other
                        minor offshores as a base for raids against the mainland, it would be easier
                        for the Chinese Communists to build up a case in the eyes of the world
                        justifying a military assault by them against these islands. Consequently, I
                        believe we should consider repeating our warning of last year, if raids from
                        the offshores should be resumed.</p>
                    <p>The timing of any such action would be influenced by measures we may take to
                        cope with the serious situations in Laos and Vietnam, which might ultimately
                        involve the Chinese Communists. It would be untimely, I think, to be warning
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> against their minor harassing
                        activities against the China mainland, just at the moment we were
                        undertaking strong measures in Southeast Asia.</p>

                    <p>I have been in touch with Bill Nelson and other members of the Country Team
                        on this matter, and will, of course, discuss it with the Ambassador.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">Wright raised the subject of the May 16 clash at
                            Matsu with <persName>Shen</persName> on June 19. He warned him that
                            launching raids from the offshore islands was dangerous because it
                            invited retaliation against the islands and that it would be unwise of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to rely on U.S. assistance in
                            such a situation. <persName>Shen</persName> said this was the first he
                            had heard of the episode but that he would pass on what Wright had told

                    <p>After Tuesday's Assistant Secretaries meeting with Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, he held me back for a while to
                        talk about China, particularly the Greene film. In the course of our
                        conversation, he indicated that he was inclined to go along with transfer of
                        the “<hi rend="italic">Warsaw</hi> Talks" from Warsaw to Paris, and believed
                        also that <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> had made a good
                        suggestion in offering hope that we might get a quid pro quo from this move
                        which presumably Peking very much wants. In addition to asking the release
                        of our prisoners, he threw out the possibility that we ask Peking to alter
                        its present policy with respect to U.S. scholars and newspapermen desiring
                        to go to Communist China.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PPM1">Paul Popple</persName> rightly points out that
                        there are certain risks in negotiating with Peking over the locus for the
                        Warsaw talks; we might even lose the contact in Warsaw itself. My own view
                        is that we should welcome the transfer, notwithstanding <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s warnings.</p>

                        <item>The international Communist movement is now openly split into majority
                            and minority factions oriented respectively toward the Russians and the
                            Chinese. It is also disturbed by other factors, such as the weakening of
                            Soviet authority in Eastern Europe, the example of Yugoslavia, and the
                            independent inclinations of a number of Communist parties, notably the
                            Communist Party of Italy. (Paras. 1–16)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The Sino-Soviet dispute will probably continue to have its ups and
                            downs, and in certain circumstances relations between the two states
                            might improve considerably. However, the rift is so deep and the
                            national interest of each party so heavily engaged that there is now
                            virtually no chance of reconciliation under the present leaders. The
                            international movement may now be on the eve of a formal split, but
                            whether or not this step is taken, the bitter struggle for control and
                            influence over the Communist parties will continue. Further tension in
                            state relations between China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also seems likely, especially on the common frontier.
                            The demise of either or both of the present leaders would offer some
                            prospect of temporary amelioration of the dispute, but we believe that
                            the fundamental differences between the two powers would remain. (Paras.
                            2–5)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The international Communist movement as a whole is likely to be
                            characterized by increased dispersion of authority and by more
                            independent conduct by various parties. Although Soviet power remains a
                            major factor in Eastern Europe, further manifestations of autonomous and
                            nationalist behavior will probably occur. Among the parties out of <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0097"/>power, we foresee a trend toward
                            regionalism—as in the Far East, but also perhaps in Western Europe and
                            Latin America. The Sino-Soviet competition for influence will in some
                            cases lead to further splits within individual parties. At the same
                            time, Moscow and Peiping will remain powerful sources of material
                            support for their followers, and will retain considerable operational
                            influence on a bilateral basis. (Para. 11, 24–25, 29–33)</item>

                        <item>For the non-Communist world this situation offers important advantages
                            and some dangers. The assertion of divergent national interests by
                            Communist powers offers an opportunity for the West to deal profitably
                            with some of them individually. The Sino-Soviet conflict is increasingly
                            absorbing the energies of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Communist China and diverting them from sharp contentions with the major

                            have already suffered severe setbacks as a result of the conflict. On
                            the other hand, some Communist parties will become more effective and
                            will gain greater freedom of action and respectability because of their
                            more independent status. While in some countries the parties will tend
                            to lose their rationale and elan, in others they will probably emerge as
                            more formidable revolutionary organizations, though more national than
                            international in character. Regardless of internal quarrels, Communists
                            will retain an underlying enmity toward the West if only because their
                            convictions are in so many respects incompatible with traditional
                            Western concepts of political and economic life. (Paras. 37–40)</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>In general, we foresee the emergence of a variety of Communists and
                            Communist parties, some chiefly influenced by Moscow or Peiping, some
                            largely autonomous. In conducting their relations with Communist states
                            and forming their policies toward revolutionary movements, the principal
                            non-Communist powers will probably find it increasingly advantageous to
                            judge each particular situation on its own merits, rather than on the
                            assumptions which generally prevailed when Moscow unquestionably
                            dominated the international movement. This situation offers new
                            opportunities and advantages to Western policy, but it presents new
                            dangers and difficulties as well. (Paras. 40–43)</item>

                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: ChiComs in June held major party
                        meeting and apparently consulted with North Vietnamese and other friends.
                        Result has been deeper ChiCom commitment to come to assistance North
                        Viet-Nam if attacked. (See July 9 People's Daily Editorial.) While ChiComs
                        thus more committed to meet major US attack, they have avoided committing
                        selves to explicit action in response US actions at lower level. We presume
                        they will reiterate threats contained July 9 editorial. We are particularly
                        interested to see whether their private statements to us differ in any way
                        from the public utterances. We are also interested in determining whether
                        they press strongly for reconvened Geneva Conference, and on what terms.
                        Intensity of pressure in this direction probably would reflect degree of
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> concern at likelihood
                        escalation in Southeast Asia. We do not have indications that ChiComs
                        presently anticipate US attack on North Viet-Nam. <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0100"/>First session with new ChiCom representative affords good
                        opportunity both to clarify US signals on <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and to indicate our desire to keep open Warsaw channel. End

                            <p>“While we cannot boast of many successes or much agreement reached in
                                these talks, hope you agree that they have served useful purpose in
                                permitting contact and providing channel in case of need. We believe
                                it is to advantage both our sides to have clear understanding of
                                each other's intentions, particularly in situations where there is
                                serious threat of a major confrontation.</p>
                            <p>“In Southeast Asia we presently face just such a serious situation.
                                We have read your statements as to obligation which you feel to
                                support Communization of other nations. We see a confrontation
                                between your ambitions and our resolve to prevent non-Communist
                                governments of Southeast Asia from being overturned by infiltration
                                and subversion supported and led from outside their borders.</p>
                            <p>“If in fact we stand perilously [close] to a confrontation, it is no
                                pleasure to us. We have too much affection and respect for Chinese
                                people to enjoy possibility of becoming involved in hostilities
                                involving them. Nevertheless, if we correctly read your intentions,
                                the possibility exists. If we have misread your intentions, we
                                should be informed.”</p>

                                Phouma. <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> have endeavored to undermine
                                arrangements. North Vietnamese troops have never left Laos as
                                provided in Geneva Agreement and they continue use Laotian territory
                                as route of infiltration to South Viet-Nam, in violation 1962
                                Agreements. With assistance of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,
                                    <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> has taken over Plaine des

                                done so on fiction that neutralist forces in possession that area
                                had suddenly become no longer “true neutralists,” apparently because
                                    <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> decided they were not amenable

                                requests for assistance by the legitimate government of Laos
                                recognized by all participants in Geneva settlement.</p>
                            <p>We read in People's Daily of July 6 that “US and Laotian right wing
                                ousted Prince Souvanna from power by force, put him under house
                                arrest, announced his removal from Premiership, etc.” You have
                                fabricated your own version of events by ignoring explicit US
                                condemnation of April 19 coup and continued US support for Souvanna,
                                and by attempting to create a US announcement which does not exist.
                                A policy based on unreality constitutes a peril for all involved. It
                                is unfortunate enough for you to make such misstatements. We hope
                                that you do not believe them. Similarly, we hope that you understand
                                correctly the firmness of our resolve to support the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, and that you are not acting on
                                basis of a willful underestimate of our seriousness and ability to
                                assist <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> to defend its

                            <persName>Wang</persName> may ask for US view on draft joint statement
                            presented 120th meeting requesting US adhere Bandung principles and
                            withdraw from Taiwan. Suggest you tell Wang US favors these principles,
                            but we have observed that his side seems to have no scruples of
                            conscience in pronouncing such principles, and then announcing support
                            of Communist insurrection in free world. We believe in non-interference,
                            and wished that his side really shared the belief. As for “withdrawal"
                            from Taiwan US has treaty obligation with Republic of China. We will not
                            abandon this obligation. There are a few thousand US military advisors
                            on Taiwan. It requires a remarkable imagination to say that these men
                            seized Taiwan by force of arms and are controlling the Republic of China
                            and its army of several hundred thousand.</item>

                        when the Chinese would explode a device. However, we had observed five
                        installations associated with the Chinese Atomic Energy Program in various
                        stages of assembly and operation and hence I concluded they had overcome
                        some, if not all, of their problems associated with the Soviet's withdrawal
                        of technical assistance and were now making progress.<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">An attached paper dated July 22, entitled “Chinese

                            doctrine but unlike you we do not have single soldier in any foreign
                            territory anywhere in world. We have never advocated export of
                            revolutions in propagating our revolutionary doctrine. We only publicize
                            objective truth.” Continued our armed intervention many areas of world
                            was aggression. Said we and not they unscrupulously meddled in affairs
                            other countries. Seizure Taiwan and interference Chinese internal
                            affairs gave rise Sino-American dispute. These facts can in no way be

                            planning new military adventures there which aroused concern people of
                            China, Asia and rest of world. Said after assassination Foreign Minister
                            Laos we had again instigated rightists to stage coup and our
                            intervention had known no bounds. Geneva accords in danger being
                            completely scrapped. On June 11 our fighter bombers bombed Khang Khay.
                            Our brutal atrocity caused heavy losses among Lao and killed one,
                            wounded five in Chinese Economic and Cultural Commission. Chinese
                            Government and people expressed great indignation at this and Wang
                            instructed lodge serious protest to US through me. Chinese Government
                            reserves all rights pursue responsibility in this case (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). Said we had long since thrown overboard
                            Geneva agreements South Vietnam and even clamoring spread war to North
                            Vietnam. Present situation Indo-China exceedingly grave. There is danger
                            flames of war will spread even to whole of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. China is signatory to both Geneva agreements and these
                                <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0107"/>matters have direct bearing
                            on Chinese security. China cannot look on with apathy in face grave
                            situation we have created in Indo-China. Chen Yi has made clear Chinese
                            people absolutely will not sit idly by while Geneva agreements torn up
                            and flames of war spread. Chinese people cannot be expected look on with

                            attention. China had advocated conference fourteen signatory nations

                            fourteen endorsed proposal but we obstructing holding conference,
                            putting blind faith in force of arms, believing we can act with
                            impunity. Said we must understand revolutionary people cannot be cowed
                            into submission through force of arms. This policy would ultimately
                            bring ignominious fiasco.</item>

                        <item>I responded I was astonished and dismayed at
                            <persName>Wang</persName>'s statements and must state categorically many
                            of them inaccurate. For instance we had nothing do with bombing Khang
                            Khay. Re Taiwan I made clear US has no intention abandoning treaty
                            obligations. Followed with substance latter half section 10 reference
                            telegram then first half re draft statement. I then spoke of peaceful
                            coexistence and exportation revolutions, quoting from <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> Central Committee letter to
                            Soviets June 14 last year re general line including concept “to support
                            and assist the revolutionary struggles of all the oppressed peoples and
                            nations.” Said this policy has caused ChiComs give support contrary
                            Geneva agreements to wars being waged by <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> in Laos and Viet Cong in both Laos and South Vietnam.
                            Asked how in face this quote issued by highest authority and in face
                            ChiCom deeds Laos and Vietnam they could expect us let <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> fall through <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> use of force against wishes people of area. Said we
                            agreed most unfortunate for everyone if war expanded such as to North
                            Vietnam but on other hand surely ChiComs must realize if their gross
                            interference Laos and South Vietnam continues there is danger war might
                            spread and it is that we wish avoid. If we are agreed on necessity
                            upholding Geneva agreements that is great step forward. Unfortunately
                            complete discrepancy between ChiCom words spoken here and deeds <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> continued I had made clear US determined
                            continue intervention Indo-China and even made threat extending war to
                            North Vietnam. Said this was making mockery of Sino-American
                            ambassadorial level talks. Said he wanted tell me bluntly 650 million
                            Chinese people <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0108"/>cannot be bullied
                            easily. Indomitable Chinese nation cannot ever be cowed into submission.
                            We would do well ponder matter carefully as to serious consequences for
                            ourselves which will arise as result our irresponsible behavior. Said
                            despite our lawlessness Indo-China his government had consistently
                            exercised self-restraint. Should we make miscalculation and take this
                            attitude as sign weakness and think we can act as we please with
                            impunity, going on with present course, we would find ourselves “licked
                            by the fire with which you have been playing.” Said Indo-China is next
                            door to China and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and other <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> states related to China “like lips and

                            sit idly by while US expanded war. Whatever Chinese Government and
                            people say will count and we would do well bear this in mind. Evident US
                            should be held fully responsible for daily worsening situation
                            Indo-China. We were trying to play trick of thief crying “stop thief"
                            and make wild allegation Chinese support <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in aggression. Said it was known to whole world <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> firmly abided by all provisions Geneva
                            agreements. There was no single foreign military base or single foreign

                        <item>I replied remarks re seizure Taiwan so wide of mark I need not review

                            Have been no hostile military operation by US there. As for

                    <p>Regardless of how Peking and Hanoi respond to our air strikes, I think we
                        should consider the advisability of an emergency Warsaw meeting as soon as
                        possible between <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> and

                        the Taiwan Straits build-up of 1962.)</p>
                    <p>The purpose of such a meeting would be to make clear to the Chinese once
                        again that we have no desire to expand the war but are willing to do so if
                        forced by their actions and those of Hanoi. I realize that we have tried to
                        make this point in a number of ways over the past few months. However, our
                        air strikes and our dramatic and visible build-up in Southwest Pacific may
                        well combine, despite our best intentions, to communicate a significantly
                        different message: one of U.S. determination to destroy the North Vietnam
                        regime and even to strike Hainan and South China.</p>
                    <p>So far, the Chinese have appeared to be opposed to escalation of the
                        conflict; they also appear to have believed that we are similarly opposed.
                        Their relatively cautious pattern of response seems to bear this out. Once
                        they conclude that our objectives have changed, however, this can produce a
                        basic shift in their own thinking and actions. In such altered
                        circumstances, they might well consider taking any pre-emptive actions
                        available to them (i.e. air or naval attacks against vessels in the Gulf of
                        Tonkin and a full-scale southward thrust of their own armed forces) on the
                        assumption that all-out war was in the offing anyway.</p>
                    <p>In short, it seems to me imperative that where misinterpretation and
                        miscalculation may well produce rashness rather than caution, we should move
                        to use any channel of communication available to us. With such potential
                        targets as Port Wallut so close to the Chinese border, the burden of
                        communication rests with us. We have communicated to all other governments;
                        we should not neglect our prime adversary.</p>

                    <p>6. I then brought up the question of a U–2 flight over high priority targets
                        in South China, presented a flight plan and a weather map. Pointed out that
                        a weather phenomena would occur over the next two days because of the
                        approaching hurricane and that we could expect reasonably good
                        weather—categories 2 and 3—over the area of interest in the next two days.
                        For that reason I recommended that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> be
                        authorized to fly a U–2 [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

                        civilian pilot, utilizing a cover story which was discussed in its broad
                        outline. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> expressed approval.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> saw the advantages but withheld judgment.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> reported that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> opposed. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported that he felt that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opposed, but was not
                        sure of his position. <persName>Bundy</persName> stated this was a matter
                        for Presidential decision and that the President should meet with <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
                        hear the arguments and make the decision and he agreed to arrange such a
                        meeting immediately. I stated this was not possible from my standpoint
                        because of the necessity to go to Gettysburg to brief General Eisenhower. It
                        was agreed, therefore, that the subject would be discussed separately with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and then Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> would approach the President. However, he
                        called the President on the telephone in the meeting room, outlined the
                        problem to him; the President indicated he desired to think the matter over
                        and would render a decision later in the day.</p>
                    <p>I then went to <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>'s office and
                        reviewed the program with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. In this discussion I made the specific
                        recommendation that the flight be conducted on one or both of the next two
                        days, taking advantage of the break in the weather, and that if it was not
                        so conducted, we probably would not have another opportunity for some time
                        because <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0112"/>of the weather which would
                        close in. I told the Secretary there was a very definite intelligence gap
                        that worried me and that I felt the risk of the flight was worth it. The
                        Secretary said he was unalterably opposed on the grounds that the flight
                        would become known to the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and it
                        would exacerbate the situation and he wished to take a “wait and see"
                        attitude before making any further move which could be construed by Hanoi or
                        Peiping as a further United States provocation. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was quite agreeable for me to present my
                        views to the President and he felt that, from the standpoint of my
                        responsibilities, this should be done, but from his standpoint he was
                        opposed.</p>
                    <p>I left for Gettysburg feeling that <persName>Bundy</persName> would follow
                        through as agreed and discuss the subject further with the President.</p>
                    <p>The next morning <persName>Bundy</persName> called me and said that <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had talked to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was unalterably opposed to the flight despite <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s recommendation, and the fact
                        that the flight involved a comparatively “low risk,” and since both
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> were definitely opposed to the
                        flight, he, <persName>Bundy</persName>, felt it would serve no useful
                        purpose to bring my recommendation again to the attention of the President
                        as he would undoubtedly look to his two Secretaries for advice and would be
                        governed accordingly. Therefore <persName>Bundy</persName> had, on his own
                        initiative, decided not to present the matter to the President.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To assess the likelihood that the advanced stage of construction at a
                        probable nuclear test site in Western China indicates that the Chinese <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0113"/>Communists will detonate their first
                        nuclear device in the next few months.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>On the basis of new overhead photography, we are now convinced that the
                        previously suspect facility at Lop Nor in Western China is a nuclear test
                        site which could be ready for use in about two months. On the other hand the
                        weight of available evidence indicates that the Chinese will not have
                        sufficient fissionable material for a test of a nuclear device in the next
                        few months. Thus, the evidence does not permit a very confident estimate of
                        the chances of a Chinese Communist nuclear detonation in the next few
                        months. Clearly the possibility of such a detonation before the end of this
                        year cannot be ruled out—the test may occur during this period. On balance,
                        however, we believe that it will not occur until sometime after the end of
                        1964.</p>

                        <item>Overhead photography of 6–9 August shows that the previously suspect
                            facility near Lop Nor in Sinkiang is almost certainly a nuclear testing
                            site. Developments at the facility include a ground scar forming about
                            60 percent of a circle 19,600 feet in diameter around a 325-foot tower
                            (first seen in April 1964 photograph), and work on bunkers near the
                            tower and instrumentation sites at appropriate locations is underway.

                            the outward appearance and apparent rate of construction indicate that
                            the site could be ready for a test in two months or so. The
                            characteristics of the site suggest that it is being prepared for both
                            diagnostic and weapon effect experiments.</item>

                        <item>Analysis of all available evidence on fissionable material production
                            in China indicates—though it does not prove—that the Chinese will not
                            have sufficient material for a test of a nuclear device in the next few
                            months. The only Chinese production reactor identified to date is the
                            small, air-cooled reactor at Pao-t'ou. As of September 1963, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Construction was continuing throughout the site,
                            including some fairly substantial work around the building which houses
                            the reactor. Photography of March 1964 indicated that major construction
                            at the site—including service roads, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] and additional security
                            provisions—had apparently been completed. Thus we believe the reactor
                            went into operation possibly in the latter part of 1963 but more
                            probably in early 1964. We estimate that, even if no major obstacles
                            were encountered, it would take at least 18 months, and more likely two
                            years, after the starting up of the Pao-t'ou reactor before a nuclear
                            device would be ready for testing. Thus, if the Pao-t'ou reactor started
                            operation no earlier than late 1963 and if it is China's only operating
                            production reactor, the earliest possible date for testing is
                            mid-1965.</item>

                        <item>It is, of course, possible that the Chinese have another source of
                            fissionable material. Such a facility might have been started with
                            Soviet aid as a result of the 1957 Soviet-Chinese aid agreement,
                            probably about the same time as the Lanchou gaseous diffusion building.
                            We would expect this reactor to be a fairly large water-cooled
                            production reactor. There are areas, particularly parts of Szechwan,
                            which are suitable for such a reactor and have not been photographed.
                            Since it is doubtful that a reactor of this type could have been
                            finished before the withdrawal of Soviet technicians in 1960, its
                            completion would have depended on a native Chinese effort, a difficult
                            but not impossible task. Such a reactor might have started operations in
                            1962 or 1963, thus making available sufficient plutonium for a test by
                            the end of this year.</item>

                            isotope separation plant has been found. We believe it unlikely—though
                            clearly not impossible—that such an operating facility exists.</item>

                        <item>It is also possible that the Chinese may have acquired fissionable
                            material from a foreign source, [<hi rend="italic">9 lines of source
                                text not declassified</hi>]. As for the Soviets, we do not believe
                            that in the past they have transferred appreciable amounts of
                            weapon-grade material to the Chinese. In the current state of their
                            relations with the Chinese, they would almost certainly not furnish
                            fissionable materials to them.</item>

                        <item>Obviously, it is incongruous to bring a test site to a state of
                            readiness described in paragraph 1 without having a device nearly ready
                            for testing. It would be technically undesirable to install much of the
                            instrumentation more than a few weeks before the actual test. We cannot
                            tell from available photography whether the installations have yet
                            reached this point—it seems unlikely that they have, mainly because some
                            heavy construction is still going on. However, it is possible that the
                            basic work will soon be completed, and that final preparations could be
                            made this fall.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>On the other hand, in such a complex undertaking as advanced weapons
                            development—especially when it is almost certain that there is heavy
                            political pressure for at least some results—it would not be surprising
                            if there were uneven progress among various phases of the program. In a
                            number of instances in the past, Peiping has been unable to prevent—and
                            has seemed willing to tolerate—uneven development in various important
                            programs. Indeed, in other parts of their advanced weapons program we
                            have already observed this. Some facilities seem to be behind
                            schedule—notably the incomplete gaseous diffusion plant at Lanchou;
                            others are larger and more elaborate than present Chinese <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0115"/>capabilities warrant—for example, the
                            possible nuclear weapons complex near Koko Nor.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>As for the test site itself, Lop Nor is extremely remote, with poor
                            transportation and communication facilities, and we might expect to see
                            the Chinese taking a long leadtime in preparing this installation. They
                            have relatively few men with the necessary scientific competence and
                            they cannot be fully confident that unexpected difficulties will not
                            appear. We believe the Chinese would do everything in their power to
                            prevent a last minute hitch on the testing facility from delaying, even
                            briefly, China's advent as a nuclear “power.”</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>The evidence and argument reviewed above do not permit a very
                            confident estimate of the chances of a Chinese Communist nuclear
                            detonation in the next few months. Clearly the possibility of such a
                            detonation before the end of this year cannot be ruled out—the test may
                            occur during this period. On balance, however, we believe that it will
                            not occur until sometime after the end of 1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">[<hi rend="italic">Footnote in the source text (1

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I well recall our conversations of a little over a year ago in which the
                        subject of “return to the mainland" was given extensive coverage. I recall
                        also that Ambassador Kirk's principal concern was the possibility of a move
                        towards a channel crossing by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which
                        might get underway without our knowledge. Following my several conversations
                        with you, I explored this problem in considerable detail with him with a
                        view to continuation of the informative and preventative measures which he
                        proposed.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0116"/>
                    <p>Over the past year a noticeable change has taken place in the attitude of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> toward “mainland recovery”. There
                        has been a very definite quiescence on the extensive preparations and
                        planning which took place in late 1962 and early 1963. During this period
                        you will recall the planning agencies of the Ministry of National Defense
                        were burning the midnight oil to crank out plans for operations toward this
                        objective.</p>
                    <p>During the past six months there has been a noticeable slacking off, if not
                        disappearance, of this intensive effort and in its place we find a rather
                        keen and increasing interest in developments in Southeast Asia, particularly
                        in Laos and South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I have covered in greater detail the changes which I have noted and the
                        reasons therefor in my Embassy A–138,<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">Airgram
                            A–138 from Taipei, August 21, noted that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> infiltration attempts and commando raids had not
                            revealed any weak spots in the mainland coastal defenses; on the
                            contrary, the loss well out to sea of two commando teams in July had
                            been a severe setback to the program and had forced a reevaluation of
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> strategy. (Department of State,

                        enclosing a copy in the event you care to examine these details.</p>
                    <p>I could summarize the situation by relating two circumstances which have
                        deviated the attention of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from
                        across-the-channel amphibious operations to developments in Southeast Asia

                                examined by our staff and their inadequacies and deficiencies
                                thoroughly developed. These shortcomings, I am sure, reached the
                                eyes and ears of the President and were instrumental in convincing
                                him of the gargantuan nature of such an operation and the need for
                                massive U.S. support.</item>

                            <item>The worsening situation in Southeast Asia has, I believe, revealed
                                to the President the possibilities of getting into China by the
                                Southern route rather than by the route of direct amphibious
                                assault.</item>

                    <p>This change in their approach does not signify in any sense a reduction in
                        their desire to return to the mainland but rather a change in the method and
                        approach as to how this might be accomplished.</p>

                    <p>I believe there are few, if any, on our side who would be surprised at the
                        conclusion reached by COM US <gloss target="#t_TDC1">TDC</gloss> that the
                        various operations contemplated in this planning exercise are beyond <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> capabilities with present forces. In my
                        opinion the greatest value of this planning exercise is the point noted in
                        your letter, i.e. that it has brought home to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> the magnitude of such operations and its own deficiencies
                        in resources for carrying them out. This has no doubt reduced any tendency
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> may still have toward irresponsible
                        military ventures and, perhaps even more significant, it should help place
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> political thinking on a more
                        realistic foundation. I am glad to see that the “Blue Lion" Committee is to
                        continue since it has served, and I think can continue to serve, a very
                        important purpose.</p>
                    <p>In conjunction with the “Blue Lion" report, I was interested in seeing the
                        further amplification of the mainland recovery subject which you sent us in

                        in the circumstances, though it is not something we can welcome
                        wholeheartedly. Obviously <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> objectives in
                        Southeast Asia differ widely from our own and we must continue to watch

                    <p>210. For Ambassador from Secretary. I have reviewed recent exchange messages
                        concerning approaches to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposed by
                            <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> in connection reported <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> activities Thailand and Burma. In view of
                        recent conversations Gen Yeh and <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName> in which US views on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-sponsored paramilitary activities <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> reaffirmed, I agree with you that we have probably done
                        enough for the present to make our position clear to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. However, I still believe it would be
                        useful bring to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attention at highest
                        level two points which apparently have not been mentioned or stressed in
                        conversations with Yeh and <persName>Chiang</persName>. We should report to
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fact that Burmese Foreign Office has
                        expressed to our Embassy Rangoon its concern over resumption what they refer
                        to as “legitimate <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>” activities in
                        Thai-Burma border area under direction <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        officials in Thailand; and we should mention our belief, based upon various
                        reports, that these activities were probably a subject of discussion during
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>'s visit Rangoon last
                        July. Both points I believe would be of legitimate interest to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> even apart from opportunity they provide to
                        restate our position on irregulars.</p>
                    <p>In connection Burmese Foreign Office approach to us, you might wish say that
                        Burmese did not present evidence of activities in question and our Embassy
                        did not express any opinion as to basis Burmese concern. However, our
                        Ambassador did reaffirm to Burmese our continuing opposition to any
                        recurrence unfortunate Chinese irregulars issue which has left lasting
                        legacy misunderstanding between US and Burma.</p>
                    <p>I believe it should be possible to bring these points to President Chiang's
                        attention in manner which would subtly complement rather than offensively
                        duplicate recent conversations with <persName>Chiang</persName> and Yeh. I
                        suggest further that you introduce these points during next appropriate
                        occasion when you meet with President on other business, rather than seek
                        special meeting to discuss them.</p>
                    <p>You are of course aware that Chinese irregulars question continues to be of
                        concern to us. We are determined to do everything possible assure that GRC
                        does not undertake excessive or indiscreet actions, as they have in past,
                        which could needlessly complicate our problems in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. In this we recognize that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has its own axes to grind in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. In pursuing its objectives against the mainland, it has a
                        natural tendency to <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0119"/>go beyond what we
                        consider limits of prudence and to be less than candid with us in doing
                        so.</p>

                    <p>446. Personal for Chief of Mission. I trust that you will do all in your
                        power to ensure that countries now recognizing the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will continue this policy and that those not now
                        recognizing Peiping will not move closer to Communist China. It is clear
                        that the Chinese Communists are mounting a subtle, persistent offensive,
                        particularly in Africa, with a view to improving their international
                        position at the expense of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. An
                        official Chinese Communist goodwill mission now touring West Africa is
                        trying to undermine the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position there.
                        Malawi and Northern Rhodesia appear disposed to establish relations with
                        Peiping.</p>
                    <p>I am sure you realize, as we move into the weeks preceding the General
                        Assembly, that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s status in the
                        United Nations depends upon a solid international position. Moreover, it
                        would be particularly dangerous for the peace of the world if Peiping were
                        to be rewarded with recognition and admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at a time when the Chinese Communists are inciting
                        aggression in Asia, encouraging rebellion in Africa and extolling militant
                        revolution in much of the world. This point should be of particular concern
                        in those areas of the world where the Chinese Communists are now actively
                        supporting revolutionary and subversive movements which seek to topple duly
                        constituted authority.</p>
                    <p>I leave to your judgment what measures will be best suited to the situation

                            <p>An understanding of what progress should be made in Taiwan in the
                                next five years can best be obtained by looking beyond this period
                                and considering what situation we would like to see there in the
                                mid-1970's. The following outline of the hoped-for Taiwan of 1975
                                necessarily reflects judgments on what is possible as well as on
                                what is desirable. It must be emphasized, however, that it is not an
                                intelligence estimate.</p>

                                be cut off from significant contact with mainland China. <list>

                                            <hi rend="italic">Social</hi>. By 1975, one might hope
                                            that the line between Taiwanese and mainlanders would
                                            have become somewhat blurred through increased
                                            inter-marriage, expanded cooperation in a wide range of
                                            common enterprises, and the unifying effect of a common
                                            educational system. Knowledge of Mandarin would have
                                            become widespread, and communication between Taiwanese
                                            and mainlanders would no longer be a problem. A
                                            substantial Taiwanese-mainlander middle class and a
                                            Taiwanese-mainlander intellectual elite would have
                                            appeared, thus promoting a greater sense of communal
                                            unity.</p>
                                        <p>A significant increase in educational standards would
                                            have occurred and the body of technically skilled
                                            workers greatly expanded. The present nearly stagnant
                                            academic life on Taiwan's university campuses would have
                                            been replaced by an upsurge of intellectual activity,
                                            although some inhibitions would persist in sensitive
                                            political areas. Something approaching a cultural
                                            renaissance would be underway in literature and the fine
                                            arts.</p>

                                            have experienced a generation of continuous economic
                                            growth. The island would have been free for a number of
                                            years from dependence on all forms of concessional
                                            economic aid. Growth would be concentrated in a thriving
                                            private sector of the economy, operating with little
                                            government interference and under rationalized systems
                                            of commercial law and taxation.</p>
                                        <p>The rate of population growth would have leveled off to
                                            between one and two percent annually, thereby easing the

                                            and recovery of the mainland would still be proclaimed
                                            to be its primary national objective. However, actual

                            <p>As in the past, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s dependence
                                on the U.S. for its very existence will continue, in the final
                                analysis, to provide the principal basis for U.S. influence. We
                                face, however, the problem of adjusting to the declining importance
                                of two of the specific instruments—our economic and military aid
                                programs—through which we have made our influence felt. We must make
                                the best possible use of these instruments while we still have them.
                                We must also learn to work more effectively through international
                                organizations and private U.S institutions.</p>

                            <p>During the next few years, direct U.S. influence will probably be
                                most effective in influencing specific <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> economic development tactics, diplomatic activities
                                and defensive military policy. We shall have less influence on
                                fiscal policy, military force levels, the missions and tasks of the
                                armed forces, propaganda and clandestine operations. We shall
                                probably be least effective in the field of political reform.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, our direct means of exercising influence are reinforced
                                by indirect influence flowing from the continued pervasive
                                penetration of U.S. standards and methods throughout society and
                                from the delayed social and political repercussions of the economic

                            </p>
                            <p>For the past decade, the U.S. has operated on the assumption that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could maintain political
                                stability on Taiwan if it were protected from Communist military
                                pressures and assisted in the development of the island's economy.
                                This assumption has proved correct, but something more is likely to
                                be required in the years ahead. The stability that has prevailed on
                                Taiwan rests on a balance of opposing forces that cannot easily be
                                maintained. Unless change comes gradually and peacefully, there is a
                                danger that it will come with a disorderly rush, threatening all
                                that the US, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the people
                                of Taiwan have achieved since the loss of the mainland.</p>
                            <p>Peaceful change is everywhere a matter of timing, pace and style.
                                This is particularly true of Taiwan where ill-considered,
                                precipitate reform would be as dangerous as blind reaction. In this
                                complex and delicate situation, we must move with caution and
                                deliberation, constantly keeping in mind the limits on both our
                                understanding and our capabilities.</p>
                            <p>The weight of our influence should be thrown behind the general
                                proposition that a gradual relaxation of political controls, greater
                                observance <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0125"/>of civil rights
                                (including giving trade unions freedom of activity and functions
                                usual in democratic countries) and increased Taiwanese participation
                                in responsible levels of government are essential conditions of
                                political stability. We should make our views to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> clear whenever appropriate
                                opportunities arise in connection with specific instances in which
                                we feel <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> observance of political
                                or civil rights has been dangerously deficient.</p>
                            <p>Use should be made of the good offices of prominent Americans outside
                                the government who are known to be sympathetic to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. On occasion, the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss> and other international organizations might be
                                encouraged to call violations of political or civil rights to the
                                attention of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Public
                                information media could lend indirect support to the campaign by
                                publicizing advances in popular government in other countries and by
                                applauding constructive steps taken by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. In the field of labor rights, public and private
                                American employers on Taiwan could set a good example by recognizing
                                and dealing with unions of their Chinese employees.</p>
                            <p>Our campaign for political and civil reforms should be conducted in a
                                low key and largely behind the scenes. Great care should be taken to
                                avoid either unduly whetting Taiwanese and other oppositionist
                                political appetites or frightening <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders into more repressive policies.</p>
                            <p>The layering of the national and provincial government lends itself
                                to a gradualist approach to the problem of political reform.
                                Increasing the autonomy of the provincial government and the
                                authority of both its legislative and executive branches would
                                automatically lead to more effective popular participation in
                                government and to a more influential role for Taiwanese. At the same
                                time, the mainlander leadership could retain control over defense
                                and international relations and a share in the making of domestic
                                policy that might be adequate for their purposes. U.S. agencies on
                                Taiwan should seek to promote this development by gradually
                                increasing their dealings with the provincial government and seizing
                                appropriate opportunities to build up its prestige and
                                influence.</p>

                            <p>When appropriate and necessary, we should remind <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders of their obligation under
                                the exchange of notes of December 10, 1954, to obtain our prior
                                agreement to any offensive actions by their armed forces. If the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> appears intent on taking
                                such actions without our prior agreement, we should make clear that
                                we would be under no obligation to help contain any Communist
                                military counteraction and that our continued economic and military
                                aid to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be placed in
                                jeopardy. At the same time, we should not foreclose the option of
                                assisting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in playing an
                                effective role on the mainland in the event of a drastic increase in
                                Chinese Communist vulnerability to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> pressures.</p>

                                General Assembly declaring Chinese representation an important
                                question requiring a two-thirds vote. We should not abandon the

                            <p>In the immediate future, our main task will be to dampen down the
                                repercussions of the recent French recognition of Peiping. Over the
                                longer-run—assuming that the French action does not lead to rapid
                                erosion of the GRC's international position—the main threat to our
                                ability to protect the status of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as the representative of China in international
                                organizations will come from the existence of sentiment in many
                                governments for seating both <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and
                                Chinese Communist representatives. This sentiment might eventually
                                result in the passage of a “two Chinas" resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which would seriously undermine the

                                representative of China and would probably lead many countries to
                                recognize Communist China and officially proclaim a “two Chinas"
                                policy. This threat would become even more serious if the Chinese
                                Communists reversed their present position and indicated their
                                willingness to sit in international organizations with
                                representatives of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, or if
                                the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were to react to a mere
                                invitation to the Chinese <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0127"/>Communists to join an international organization by themselves
                                withdrawing. The first of these possibilities is fortunately remote.
                                We should guard against the second by continuing to urge on the

                                efforts to maintain its relations with governments now recognizing
                                it and to establish relations with newly independent governments. We
                                should also continue to encourage the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to use its small technical assistance program as a
                                valuable adjunct of its diplomacy, particularly in Africa.</p>
                            <p>We should view sympathetically the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> tendency to tighten its ties with other strongly

                                diplomatic reverses received or feared in other areas. But at the
                                same time we should not now support <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposals for new regional alliances. To do so
                                under existing circumstances would add little or nothing to our
                                strength in the Far East and would complicate our efforts to cope
                                with several major problems, notably those in Vietnam and Laos.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Since both the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the Chinese
                                Communists strongly oppose the separation of Taiwan from China, it
                                is most unlikely that an independent state could be created on
                                Taiwan during the next five years—or indeed for a considerably
                                longer period of time. Under present circumstances, adoption by the
                                U.S. of a “two Chinas" policy (i.e., recognition of the Chinese
                                Communist regime as the government of China and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as the government of Taiwan) would
                                be futile and would involve serious losses and risks. The value of
                                the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as a diplomatic counter to
                                the Chinese Communists would of course be largely, if not entirely,
                                lost. But beyond this, U.S. adoption of a “two Chinas" policy would
                                have a deeply unsettling effect on political stability on Taiwan,
                                conceivably including opening the door to a deal between <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> leaders and the Chinese Communists.
                                We would also risk arousing the bitter and lasting enmity of many
                                patriotic Chinese who would interpret our action as an effort to
                                separate off part of the national territory.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of any diminution of the Chinese Communist threat, the
                                governments of South Korea, South Vietnam and Thailand would regard
                                any U.S. moves toward a “two Chinas" posture with considerable
                                apprehension. This feeling would probably be shared by leaders in
                                the Philippines and Malaysia and to some extent even in Burma,
                                Indonesia and India. Pressures for accommodation with the Chinese
                                Communists would increase throughout the area.</p>
                            <p>We should, therefore, not adopt a “two Chinas" policy. At the same
                                time, we should pursue economic, political, and security policies
                                which will in fact facilitate the survival of Taiwan as an
                                independent national <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0128"/>entity
                                if, as now seems possible, this proves to be the ultimate
                                consequence of further prolonged isolation of the island from the
                                mainland of China.</p>

                    <p>We discussed the question of Chinese nuclear weapons today, first in a lunch
                        at the State Department given by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> for <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, and myself, and later at
                        a meeting with the President in which <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I
                        were with him in the Cabinet Room (<persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> having left at a time when we thought the President
                        would not be able to join us).</p>
                    <p>At the luncheon we developed the following position: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>We are not in favor of unprovoked unilateral U.S. military action
                                against Chinese nuclear installations at this time. We would prefer
                                to have a Chinese test take place than to initiate such action now.
                                If for other reasons we should find ourselves in military
                                hostilities at any level with the Chinese Communists, we would
                                expect to give very close attention to the possibility of an
                                appropriate military action against Chinese nuclear
                                facilities.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>We believe that there are many possibilities for joint action with
                                the Soviet Government if that Government is interested. Such
                                possibilities include a warning to the Chinese against tests, a
                                possible undertaking to give up underground testing and to hold the
                                Chinese accountable if they test in any way, and even a possible
                                agreement to cooperate in preventive military action. We therefore
                                agreed that it would be most desirable for the Secretary of State to
                                explore this matter very privately with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as soon as
                                possible.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>We agreed that it would be much preferable to conduct any
                                overflight of Chinese nuclear test facilities in a plane [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0129"/>text not declassified</hi>]. In
                                the course of the afternoon, Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> produced a proposal that such a flight be

                    </p>
                    <p>These preliminary decisions were reported to the President in the Cabinet
                        Room, and he indicated his approval. The Secretary of State now intends to

                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> took the position that finite

                        to him from a policy standpoint, as he knew it was inevitable and he knew of
                        no political action he would take if finite information was given to him.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> seemed to agree. After extended discussion, I
                        stated that I could not conceive of our failing to take some actions if
                        finite information was in our hands, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> might contact <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>;
                        the President might communicate with Khrushchev privately; we might discuss
                        the subject with our Allies, both in Europe and the Far East; and we might
                        take some position in the press through leaks or planted information.
                        Certainly we should discuss the subject with Thailand, Laos and South
                        Vietnam. It was agreed that the embarrassment and consequences of failure
                        outweighed the advantages and therefore, while the final decision was up to
                        the President, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> would not
                        recommend the mission. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated his concurrence but was

                                <persName>Rostow</persName>'s memorandum states that a memorandum by
                            Henry Rowen of the International Security Affairs Office in the
                            Department of Defense was to be circulated. A copy of Rowen's paper,
                            entitled “Doing Something About Communist China's Nuclear Program,”
                            September 15, was sent to <persName>Rostow</persName> on September 16.
                            (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> Files: Lot 70 D
                            199, China)</note> Rowen gave a <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0131"/>powerful counter-argument to the “temperate" approach proposed by the
                        interdepartmental planning group chaired by Bob Johnson. Rowen saw many
                        people taking an “excessively cheery" view, primarily because they were
                        thinking too much in short-run terms. True, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s wouldn't have much of a nuclear capability for a long
                        time; true, they wouldn't suddenly launch new aggressions simply because
                        they had a rudimentary capability; true, there might not be any profound
                        panic reactions from other Asians.</p>
                    <p>But the longer term implications, say over a 15-year period, were horrendous.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Harry</persName> noted that the first
                        Soviet nuclear explosion had occurred 15 years ago this month; look at the
                        growth in Soviet power in the following 15 years. Even the first Soviet test
                        might have affected Stalin's decision to launch the Korean war. In any
                        event, the staggering growth in Soviet capabilities over the last 15 years
                        had had an immense effect on our policies, postures, defense budget, etc.
                        Granted that China today has a much feebler resource base than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had in 1949; on the other hand the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might be even more adventuresome
                        once they went nuclear than the Soviets had been. There was no reason why
                        the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s could not develop even crude
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in 15 years. As for the external
                        effects of Peiping's going nuclear, these would entail greatly increased
                        pressure on us for new aid commitments, and major counter-efforts on the
                        part of those Asians who felt themselves menaced. Most immediately, India
                        could probably go nuclear in a year. As for the US, a growing <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> capability might be the deciding
                        factor driving us into a $30 billion <gloss target="#t_AICBM1">AICBM</gloss>
                        program or a huge civil defense effort. Yet another risk was that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might be freer than we or the
                        Russians in handing around nuclear technology; they had already hinted at
                        this to Nasser.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">What could we do</hi>? Rowen thought it technically
                        feasible to destroy the two key <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        installations by a limited non-nuclear air attack. We could (a) handle this
                        as a completely open matter and justify it at the time; or (b) seize on any
                        opportunity created, say by a major blow-up in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>; or (c) make a secret attack. In the latter case, it was
                        quite possible that Peiping would prefer to say nothing about it. Such a
                        spoiling operation would gain us a 2–5 year delay, and also deter <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> rebuilding. How valuable were 2–5
                        years? To Rowen they could be quite important.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">What about reactions</hi>? The Soviets would approve
                        privately, but might have to raise a to-do publicly. However, there was a
                        chance we could bring them around in advance. The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might go for a tit-for-tat response, though it wasn't
                        clear where they could do so effectively. In the rest of the world there
                        would be considerable fear—also some feeling that the US was punishing a
                        smaller power for getting into the nuclear business. Was this necessarily
                        bad, however? Moreover, initial fears might quickly turn to relief once the
                        crisis seemed to pass.</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0132"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Rostow</persName> suggested that if we and the Soviets had just
                        moved toward some big arms control agreement (say an unlimited test ban),
                        the fact that we were going in this direction would create an optimum
                        atmosphere for US pre-emption to forestall nuclear proliferation by
                        Peiping.</p>
                    <p>Bob Johnson's rebuttal was that the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> analogy was weak; the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s were a lot less further along today than the Soviets
                        were 15 years ago. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        explosion wouldn't change much, except psychologically. The US would still
                        have great nuclear superiority as a deterrent, and perhaps an effective
                        counter-force capability. The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                        would have to take into account possible pre-emptive US action if they
                        brandished missiles in a crisis or at the least assume a disproportionate US
                        retaliation if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s used nucs. He
                        queried whether US decisions on civil defense or ALCBMs were so sensitive to
                        a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> capability as Rowen indicated.
                        (I commented that the more likely problem was that a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> capability might trigger Soviet CD or
                        ALCBM programs, which in turn might trigger us.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> found the stimulus to proliferation the
                        strongest argument for pre-empting the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. But we should look at what other options we had
                        besides pre-emption. Various arms control and propaganda programs, as well
                        as new US commitments, could greatly limit the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> impact. Moreover, would pre-empting the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s prevent proliferation by other
                        powers? Countries such as Israel would have their own reasons for going
                        nuclear regardless of what China did. Finally, a one-time attack wouldn't do
                        the job. It would only buy us some delay. To repeat the performance two or
                        three times would be very difficult for the US.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s contribution was that we
                        ought to have serious discussions with the Soviets on the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear problem right after the
                        election.</p>
                    <p>It was also brought out that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                        already have overwhelming conventional superiority over their neighbors. So
                        would other Asians be materially more scared of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> power than they are already? <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        and I mentioned the “precedent" problem. Would preemption of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s encourage Nasser to take out Israeli
                        nuclear facilities? Would it encourage the Soviets to play similar
                        games?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Rostow</persName> questioned Rowen's proposition that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might become much more aggressive
                        once they had A-bombs. With nuclear weapons comes caution. The Soviets
                        advanced less after they had gone nuclear than before. They were more
                        cautious in the 1959–61 Berlin crisis than in 1948–49. As soon as the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s got nuclear weapons, they'd have to
                        worry lest we might be more inclined to use nucs against them in a local
                        conflict. So a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear capability
                        might actually operate to make the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s more cautious. Others present thought Rowen had taken the
                        best case for our pre-emptive capability, and the worst case for <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0133"/>what the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would do if we didn't pre-empt. Rowen gladly conceded
                        the point.</p>
                    <p>Rostow summed up by saying that if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s attacked in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, then
                        we had an overwhelming case for pre-emption. As to the other case, we should
                        keep looking at it, particularly in the context of whether we could arrive
                        at a broader modus vivendi with the Soviets about Germany, arms control,
                        etc. If we and the Soviets could isolate the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in this way, by getting world opinion on our side, then
                        the reaction to pre-emption would be considerably less. However, WWR didn't
                        see Khru-shchev prepared to go this far for quite a while yet.</p>
                    <p>There was an interesting aside when WWR asked <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> his view. Dick said he had raised this question
                        several times at the White House and had been told to “keep his mouth shut.”
                        He pointed the finger at me and I said that I'd in effect been shut up too,
                        but that you seemed to have no objection to PG discussion. I suspect that
                        several of those present concluded that some planning was probably afoot on
                        this matter. If so, or if there ought to be, the best cover for it might be
                        simply to put out the word that we've taken a negative decision on the
                        matter.</p>

                            meeting we were well aware of serious consequences which could come from
                            extension war beyond borders South Vietnam and seek avoid it. Yet we had

                            Gulf incident as pretext expand war in Indo China. US surprise attack
                            against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> had met head on blow and
                            even so-called allies failed give US active support in Vietnam. This
                            illustrative of isolation in which we find ourselves in world. Said
                            virtually every day US aircraft, warships invaded territorial waters
                            other nations in Far East and large reinforcements being sent South

                            operational plan for North Vietnam in further expansion war.
                            Particularly serious that on September 18 we concocted another alleged
                            Gulf of Tonkin incident as excuse to expand war. <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> strongly supports serious warning already served US by
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Alleged trend of opinion in US
                            assumed Chinese reaction to August 4 incident was not strong and so
                            there was suggestion we could “try it again”. Debt of blood to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> not yet repaid. Should we make another
                            adventure, it could be said with certainty the situation in Vietnam and
                            whole of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> would be beyond repair.
                            Mentioned recent serious warnings saying he directed to launch serious
                            protest against such unscrupulous violation sovereignty of China.
                            Mentioned increased support Taiwan and visits there of US “brass hats”.
                            Said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was calling
                            white black when he said China and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            must come to decision leave neighbors alone. Trick of thief shouting
                            “stop thief" can fool no one. He said if we bent on war then Chinese
                            people have no alternative but to keep us company to the end. Hoped
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would take note of this.</item>

                        <item>I said I shared hope he had expressed that peace could be
                            reestablished in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> but regretted say
                            did not think his statements today had in any way contributed to that
                            result. Spoke of detailed account first two incidents Tonkin Gulf as
                            taken from log books American vessels involved. I gave facts of
                            incidents and emphasized Hanoi should be made to realize its actions
                            must inescapably involve other powers. Then restated at length our
                            policies <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> adding our response would
                            continue to be restrained but it was important his side not misread our

                            <persName>Wang</persName> repeated at length his accusations our words
                            inconsistent with our deeds, saying Chinese knew true facts Tonkin Gulf
                            incidents and futile for me try argue otherwise. Called second Tonkin
                            Gulf incident “a lie" saying on August 4 <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> did not have single war vessel in waters where US ships
                            were and whole world knows this attack never occurred. Announcements by
                            US Defense Department officials contradictory and full of loopholes and
                            description so called encounter contrary to elementary military sense.
                            Spoke further of alleged intrusions and claimed US on 30 July shelled
                            two <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> islands. Alleged USS Maddox on 2
                            August intruded into territorial waters <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Concocted incident September 18 was attempt repeat

                            Since we had not been able piece together coherent story how did we
                            expect fool others. Repeated it was clear <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> simply lying. Implied we could not [be] well aware

                            war in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. Gave long tirade about
                            alleged US aggressive action in Far East and whole world saying <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> supported national liberation movements
                            in world because these movements are just ones. Communists have never
                            tried to conceal their position. Had always stood by side with oppressed
                            nations and people throughout world. This was honorable and no attack
                            could ever check their determination. Spoke at length of the law of the
                            development of history saying revolutions could neither be exported nor
                            imported but it was also impossible for anyone to put down by force a
                            genuine revolution. Said he thought it was a fraud when I said we would
                            be restrained and would take limited action. Asked whether it could be
                            said aggressive action became legitimate if limited.</item>

                        <item>I said I considered his remarks a deplorable contribution to our
                            talks. I said <persName>Wang</persName> seemed imply that any US
                            presence in Tonkin Gulf impermissible. I denied American warships had
                            penetrated what we considered under international law to be territorial
                            space or waters of any nation <persName>Wang</persName> mentioned.
                            Certainly three incidents in Gulf all took place many miles from
                            territorial waters. I then reviewed in greater detail facts first two
                            incidents. Also denied US warship attack on islands. I referred to
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> Central Committee
                            statements supporting liberation movements, saying could not see how

                            was noninterference internal affairs other countries. Fact was North
                            Vietnam had interfered in both Laos and South Vietnam long before we
                            extended help to either. Mentioned North Vietnam prisoners captured Laos

                            international duty as well as a right for all fair minded people in

                        <label>(6)</label>
                        <item>I assured <persName>Wang</persName> that search lights, torpedos and
                            automatic weapons aimed at our vessels were not imaginary and that
                            second Tonkin incident was not “lie" as he alleged. Said must insist on
                            right my government question excessive claims to territorial waters.
                            Objected to <persName>Wang</persName>'s reference to “puppet regime" of
                            South Vietnam, pointing out that government recognized by overwhelming
                            number governments of world and if there is puppet regime in that area,
                            it is Government North Vietnam, which he said at last meeting was
                            closely connected to China as teeth and lips. Again spoke of
                            unreconcilability support of liberation movements and support five
                            principles. Mentioned confirmation North Vietnam troops in Laos

                            enormous numbers Chinese liquidated by his side did not constitute

                                <persName>Wang</persName> blandly stated difference was his
                            statements were in accordance with facts, and facts are facts. I
                            reviewed points on which we simply disagreed as to facts almost as much

                        <item>This was one of longest and on Chinese side by far most vitriolic
                            meeting in many months. <persName>Wang</persName> was loud, tendentious,
                            impolite and arrogant, virtually spitting out his accusations, often
                            with finger wagging. <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0137"/>We were
                            subject to lengthy lectures delivered from an offensively professorial
                            height. He almost invariably referred to me as “you,” whereas long habit
                            in the talks had been use “Mister Ambassador" or “Your Excellency.” He
                            used such phrases as “I want to tell you.” He called not only me, but
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> “liars.” He expressed cocky
                            contempt for our allegedly unavailing efforts in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, and made clear he thought we were seeing beginning of
                            end for us there. After I pointed out that while he objected to use of
                            word “regime" as applied to Peiping, he used it re <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and “<persName>Chiang</persName>
                            clique" for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, he seemed to take
                            pleasure in using those terms more frequently. On side rustled papers
                            quite unnecessarily while I was talking.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>There was a “Panmunjom" flavor to this meeting. Repetitious sermons,
                            full of invective and pompous Communist “axioms" were delivered with no
                            regard for factor logic, in a spirit of contemptuous one-upmanship
                            seemingly designed to arouse anger. I answered firmly but not
                            provocatively, and was careful not to let my anger show.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> obviously wanted to prolong the meeting
                            and engaged in lengthy ad libs before and after his prepared papers ran
                            out—one of which he used twice. We believe he hoped I would leave the
                            meeting with angry or at least glum mien. I therefore emerged to meet
                            the larger than usual number of newsmen with relaxed, smiling aspect.
                            Last evening one reporter told Narding press consensus based on length
                            meeting and aspect two principals on emergence was that we had read riot
                            act to Chinese due Tonkin Gulf incidents, and had derived satisfaction
                            from meeting.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The new <persName>Wang</persName> was entirely different in
                            comportment from his first meeting in July. To limited extent this may
                            be attributable his settling in saddle and hence emergence his own
                            nature as provincial, blindly dedicated cadre who has made good through
                            intelligence and loyalty with “know nothing" contempt for reason or
                            logic. I am inclined believe, however, temper of his approach largely
                            set by direction Peiping and doubtless had <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s worried. Notable that our retaliatory actions per
                            se scarcely mentioned by <persName>Wang</persName>. Instead he assumed
                            posture of heady confidence combined with threatening warnings. Believe

                    <p>I had a long and cordial lunch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in which we touched lightly on a large number of
                        topics of only casual interest. The points of principal importance are as

                        <item>My own principal effort was to direct the Ambassador's attention to
                            the problem of Communist Chinese nuclear weapons. I made it very plain
                            that in our judgment the Chinese nuclear weapons would be real
                            dissemination, while the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was nothing
                            of the sort. I also made it plain that we would be ready for private and
                            serious talk on what to do about this problem if there were any interest
                            in the Soviet Government. The Ambassador gave no direct reply, but he
                            gave me clearly to understand that in the thinking of the Soviet
                            Government the Chinese nuclear capability was already, in effect, taken
                            for granted. He argued that Chinese nuclear weapons had no importance
                            against the Soviet Union or against the U.S., and that therefore they
                            had only a psychological impact in Asia, and he implied that this impact
                            had no importance for his government.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>On China in general, the Ambassador admitted and indeed emphasized the
                            depth and strength of the existing split between Moscow and Peking, but
                            he took the view that the primary cause of this split was the personal
                            megalomania of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>. He said that
                            Stalin at his worst had never insisted upon the kind of personal worship
                            which was now accorded to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>.
                            He said that while in the Soviet Union younger men (like himself) were
                            coming into positions of responsibility, and were able to argue openly
                            and honestly with Khrushchev, in Communist China the older generation
                            and, above all, <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> himself,
                            were still in full charge and were inaccessible to reasonable argument.
                            He told me at some length of the dismal experience of Soviet advisers
                            trying to warn against the technological nonsense of the Great Leap
                            Forward. But he asserted calmly, but strongly, his conviction that in
                            the long run there would be a restoration of harmony between the two
                            countries. And at one point, in discussion of our American differences
                            with Communist China, he gently remarked on the continued existence of
                            the treaty between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the

                            the time of a detonation was of significant importance to the President

                            during which time no other important targets would be traversed.

                            on the grounds the information is not of significant importance to him
                            and the flight carried us over Burma and India which was

                        <item>In a Special National Intelligence Estimate issued in August 1964<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">
                                <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note> it was concluded that,
                            on balance, a Chinese nuclear test probably would not occur before the
                            end of 1964. At that time available information indicated that the
                            Chinese nuclear test site near Lop Nor was under active construction and
                            could be ready for a nuclear test by about October 1964. On the other
                            hand, continuing construction in September 1963 at the only known
                            Chinese plutonium production site indicated a probable startup of the
                            reactor at that site in early 1964. This in turn indicated a date around
                            mid-1965 for first availability of sufficient plutonium for a nuclear
                            test. Although neither the possibility of an earlier startup of this
                            plant nor the existence of an unidentified plutonium production facility
                            could be wholly discounted, it was felt unlikely that plutonium would be
                            available in 1964. The <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 plant at
                            Lanchou is only partially complete and thus could not contribute
                            fissionable material for a nuclear test in the near future.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>More recent information on the Lop Nor test site has confirmed the
                            earlier estimate of its probable readiness date. Preparations for a test
                            were essentially completed at the Lop Nor nuclear test site by October
                            1964. Included in these preparations is a 340 foot shot tower that was
                            installed prior to April 1964 and is now surrounded by a double fence.
                            Arrays for instrument emplacement are located around the tower. These
                            include arcs at 9,800, 16,000, 23,000 and 33,000 feet respectively and a
                            number of radial lines from the tower with bunkers and platforms
                            emplaced along the lines. Two small towers, approximately 50 feet high,
                            are located on the arc at 9,800 feet from the shot tower and at 905 from
                            each other. Available information does not permit determination of <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0142"/>whether or not instruments have
                            actually been emplaced on the platforms and towers. The high priority
                            apparently given to the completion of site construction suggests that a
                            test is scheduled in the fairly near future since it would not be
                            desirable to establish the parameters of an initial nuclear experiment
                            much in advance of the test.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>A high level of flight activity to and from the area was noted
                            throughout this very active construction period. The activity halted in
                            September 1963 when the site was essentially complete. Subsequent
                            resumption of this activity in late September may reflect final
                            preparations for testing.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>A restudy of the Pao-t'ou reactor site indicates that adequate primary
                            and backup electric power circuits for reactor operation had been
                            installed by March 1963. Thus, our confidence has been reduced in the
                            August 1964 judgment that the reactor probably did not start operation
                            until early 1964. Another prospect for a fissionable material supply is
                            a facility in a large complex near Chih-Chin-Hsia (Yumen) which might
                            contain a small operational reactor, but this identification is
                            uncertain.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>We no longer believe that evidence on plutonium availability justifies
                            the on-balance judgment reached in August 1964. We believe the Lop Nor
                            evidence indicates that a test could occur at any time. In any case we
                            believe a test will occur sometime within the next six to eight
                            months.</item>

                                        the latter date the reactor apparently was not operational
                                        however I stated it may have been shut down for change of
                                        fuel elements and hence it was possible, though by no means
                                        certain, that the reactor might have been operational in
                                        1962.</item>

                            <p>I said that the existence of the reactor was not surprising as both
                                we and the Russians had built a small graphite-cooled reactor prior
                                to the construction of our large reactors at Hanford. This reactor
                                had a capacity of between 30 and 35 kilograms plutonium per
                                year.</p>
                            <p>The test site at Lop Nor which we have observed over the past 2 or 3
                                years, during recent months had seen considerable activity on the
                                basis of photography of this site, that I had stated in my briefing
                                of the heads of eight Western European Governments that we could
                                expect a nuclear test based on the evidence of the completion of
                                this site within 30 to 60 days from the time of my briefing which
                                was mid-September, and the <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0145"/>activities we noted just prior to the explosion such as the
                                stand-down of all aviation in the area and unusual sampling of
                                weather.</p>

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I then said the known facilities could, if one assumed the earliest
                            operational dates, produce plutonium for the device and some more. Pao
                            Tou alone could not do so, but Pao Tou plus Yumen would give them
                            sufficient plutonium. The two reactors could produce between 40 and 45
                            kilograms of plutonium per year which would be enough for 6 or 7 crude
                            devices. I noted that both the United States and France had used about 6
                            kilograms or more plutonium in their initial devices and assumed that
                            the Chinese Communists would use about the same.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>With reference to delivery capability, I said that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had 290 IL–28's with a range of
                            600 nautical miles and a lift capacity of about 6,000 pounds. The bomb
                            bay however was limited to a 36" diameter bomb although it was 14' long.
                            I said we must wait the diagnosis of the radioactive debris to determine
                            the degree of sophistication of the Lop Nor device and thus make a
                            judgment as to whether the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            present technology would permit them to develop an implosive device
                            small enough to fit into the IL–28 bomb bay. Pointed out they had a few
                            “B–29" types and that they had made a considerable effort in missiles
                            and had an elaborate missile range but it was our observation that their
                            success had been marginal. Therefore it seemed to us that many years
                            would pass before the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would
                            have a sophisticated delivery capability against nearby territory and we
                            did not see them developing any intercontinental capability at this
                            time.</item>

                        <item>
                            <p>I stated that while we had extensive <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-2 and satellite photography over <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>, there was an important area
                                in and about Chungking and east on the Yangtze River on which the
                                photography was unsatisfactory and hence there might exist there or
                                elsewhere in China, a reactor or a production complex which we did
                                not know about.</p>

                        news for him. I stated that at Saturday meeting with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> I had passed all available
                        information and guidance on <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> atomic

                        developments but we were evaluating carefully statements of Izvestia and
                        Pravda and world reaction. I then gave him sanitized version of State and
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> analysis.</p>
                    <p>I then asked him if he could give me any views these two events I could pass

                    <p>President passed by specific comment on Soviet shift and concentrated on
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> event.</p>
                    <p>President stated that event of such far reaching importance that he had been
                        unable up to the present to make any detailed or specific statement or
                        comment. He stated however that he would like to pass to me “as US
                        Ambassador and friend" his own personal views on impact on Asian peoples. He
                        said that psychological reaction was enormous and far reaching. He said it
                        was a turning point in the attitude of people of this part of the world and
                        that their views on world affairs would henceforth be different from those
                        of the past. He said the psychological effect could not be
                        overestimated.</p>
                    <p>President stated that Americans at home and abroad were not capable of truly
                        appraising the psychology of Asian people. He said this event <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0147"/>required special efforts by US to see the
                        change in its true light and urged that we do all possible to this end.</p>
                    <p>I said the US was studying the situation with all resources in Asia and at
                        home. I agreed with inadequacy of Americans in true appraisal of Asian
                        thought and stated that we respected his judgement more than any other in
                        his position as true leader of Chinese people.</p>
                    <p>President then said that Asia henceforth would never be the same as it was in
                        the past. He said the United States and the Republic of China should at this
                        point reevaluate their policy toward Mainland China based not on the past
                        but the present and future and work jointly for a new solution. This latter
                        point emphasized by the Madam.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President met with the bipartisan Congressional Leadership on Monday,
                        October 19, at 1:30 p.m. The President worked from the attached briefing
                        memorandum (Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">The tabs are attached but not
                            printed.</note> and the discussion at the meeting generally followed the
                        attached agenda.</p>
                    <p>The President opened the meeting by giving his welcome to the Leadership and
                        his thanks for their return from their homes and whatever else they were
                        doing. He then asked Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        to explain what we know of the Chinese nuclear effort.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> gave a general
                        explanation of the capabilities of the United States in satellite
                        reconnaissance, and then described our current understanding of their
                        capabilities. A copy of the notes from which he worked is attached (Tab B).
                        The Director was followed by Chairman <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0148"/>Seaborg who gave a general discussion of the problems of
                        the technology of nuclear weapons. Chairman Seaborg indicated the
                        probability but not the certainty that the Chinese weapon was made of
                        plutonium (an assumption that was challenged by evidence from debris later
                        in the day). He indicated his belief that the Chinese would begin with a
                        device and that it would take sometime to “weaponize" such a device.
                        Chairman Seaborg indicated that the speed of the Chinese development would
                        depend on how much the Chinese knew about the technical details—quality of
                        material and design details—in weaponmaking. He thought that if they had
                        been fully cut off from what the Soviets knew for several years, it might be
                        a matter of about 4 or 5 years before they would have a thermonuclear
                        device. On the other hand, if they wished to make a thermonuclear explosion
                        simply for its political and psychological impact, they could use the bulk
                        of their production for this specific purpose and produce such an explosion
                        considerably sooner.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to give an account of the military position of the
                        United States vis-a-vis the Chinese bomb. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> began by discussing the dangers
                        in the spread of nuclear weapons. He pointed out that there are half a dozen
                        countries which could move rapidly in this direction if they made the
                        political decision to do so, and that the cost of developing a nuclear
                        device was now on the order of $120 million—not a prohibitive figure. He
                        underlined the importance of finding ways and means to limit nuclear
                        spread.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then turned to the
                        strategic position of the U.S. and pointed out that Chinese targets as well
                        as Soviet targets were included in our strategic planning. He explained that
                        we had 2700 nuclear weapons in our survivable alert force, and said that 800
                        of these weapons would suffice to inflict unacceptable damage on the Soviet
                        Union. The additional weapons were important for their damage-limiting
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> discussed the
                        developments in the Soviet Union, along the lines of the attached memo of
                        his talking notes (Tab C).</p>
                    <p>Senator Hickenlooper asked if the immediate meaning of the Chinese bomb was
                        not more important in its psychological impact than in its military meaning.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that we were
                        taking every possible measure in consultation with interested nations to
                        limit this psychological impact. We had given important assurances in the
                        President's statements. The Secretary reported that a number of Ambassadors
                        had told him that his warning of September 29 had been very useful in
                        limiting the impact of this event.</p>

                        Keelung, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. It would be small consolation to him to know
                        that after he was dead, U.S. would retaliate on <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. Yu warned that nuclear deterrent credible assurance
                        only when facing rational men and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                        were not rational. All Chinese in first briefing concerned re <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 content of test blast and implication that
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might have much greater
                        production capacity of fissionable material than first estimated. Gimo also
                        said this information most important.</p>
                    <p>Gimo after briefing in fairly emotional response said U.S. assurances for
                        defense of Taiwan inadequate to calm fears aroused by explosion. U.S. policy
                        of isolation of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s was no longer
                        enough. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s merely felt immune to
                        this policy which would enable <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                        perfect their nuclear capability undisturbed. He said primary <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aim was to destroy him and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and when this happened all of Asia would be
                        threatened. In reference to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> atomic
                        bombs which could be carried in present <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> air force planes, he said “we are the target”. He
                        brushed aside stated U.S. assurances of defense support and probable <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> reluctance invite retaliation. U.S.,
                        he felt, would be deterred from nuclear retaliation by European allies. It

                        it destroyed. He said explanations of how U.S. would come to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> aid left him “unconsoled”.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I return to my Far Eastern cable traffic with some thoughts on China policy
                        that may well derive from the heady brew of speech-writing for an optimist.
                        I pass them on to you not because they are particularly original, but
                        because recent events seem to me to give them new validity.</p>
                    <p>To begin with, I am struck by the quantity of the U.S. Government's time,
                        energy, and resources now focused on South Vietnam/Laos, as against all the
                        rest of Asia. This is perhaps an inevitable consequence of our preoccupation
                        with the major Communist challenge at hand. But the fact of our
                        concentration on the tail of the dog, rather than the dog itself, has been
                        dramatized anew by recent developments. (I might add that I am not even sure
                        that this tail belongs to that particular dog; there is danger in pushing
                        too far the thesis of Peking's responsibility for the South Vietnam
                        crisis.)</p>
                    <p>Given the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> nuclear blast, the new
                        Soviet leadership, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, Wilson,
                        et al, we are now moving into a period when Communist China's world position
                        will probably change quite rapidly, regardless of what we do. To what extent
                        can we influence these changes so as to minimize the damage to our security?
                        Also, to what extent can we preserve appearances—i.e., not seem to lose our
                        shirts in the process of these changes?</p>
                    <p>I have in mind, of course, two virtual certainties: that Communist China will
                        be voted into the United Nations sometime during the life of the new
                        Administration—probably not this year (although that still seems to me an
                        open question), but very probably next year; and that Communist China will
                        soon—one way or another—be brought into international negotiations regarding
                        the control of nuclear weapons. I also have in mind the fact of fast
                        increasing free world trade and travel contacts with mainland China.</p>
                    <p>Faced with these developments, we can either sit tight in increasingly lonely
                        isolation; or we can seek ways to cut our losses.</p>
                    <p>So far, we have chosen to sit tight, waiting for Peking to “shape up.” The
                        Kennedy Press conference response of last November 14 and the <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0152"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> China speech of December 13
                        are the clearest articulation of this approach at its best. During 1963–4,
                        our gradual detente with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> certainly
                        gave it added impetus; our Kremlinologists have urged us not to rock the
                        boat.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me increasingly clear, however, that our present approach
                        actually serves Peking's interests—and that Peking has no intention of
                        “shaping up" in terms of taking tension-relieving initiatives with us,
                        either now or in the foreseeable future. On the contrary, Peking is
                        seriously intent on isolating us—while we, in turn, are generally blamed for
                        trying (unsuccessfully) to isolate Peking.</p>
                    <p>I would therefore urge consideration of a different approach—one designed to
                        cut our losses, to reduce our isolation, and to improve our look as a
                        confident, realistic, and responsible world power.</p>
                    <p>My objective would be to try to bring our China policy into line with both
                        reality and our long-term interests. Our aim has always been the
                        “domestication" of Communist China. A strategy of containment plus moral
                        preachment has achieved little success in this regard. So why not try
                        modified containment—plus subversion? By the latter, I simply mean the
                        careful use of free world goods, people, and ideas—instruments which have
                        proven their long-term corrosive value in our relations with other
                        totalitarian societies.</p>
                    <p>The following ingredients seem to me appropriate to a revised China policy
                        over the next several months: <list>

                                Taiwan. (Our aim would be to hold the line on Chirep during the
                                present session but to prepare for acquiescence in a “one-China

                            <item>Sometime in January the Secretary of State should find an
                                occasion, ideally during a press conference, to note casually that
                                “of course, the United States has accorded de facto recognition to
                                the Peiping regime ever since President Eisenhower authorized the
                                Geneva and Warsaw conversations of 1954–5; our real problem,
                                however, is Communist China's continuing threat to Formosa and to
                                its neighbors.” Such a low-key remark would move us toward
                                “one-China one-Taiwan" without igniting public concern over imminent
                                de jure recognition of Peking (a move that I would regard as of
                                little value and of very low priority as long as we maintain our
                                commitments to the security and independence of Taiwan).</item>

                            <item>Early in the year, the Department of State should announce revised

                                nations we do not recognize, on the understanding that the U.S.
                                Government cannot provide protection for such travellers. (As you
                                know, this travel package was cleared through State last January;
                                the one chief difficulty seems to relate to Cuba, a point on which I

                                China on the same basis as our trade with the Soviet Union.</item>

                            <item>At the time of the next <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
                                meeting in the autumn of 1965, we should focus our energies on the
                                retention of Taiwan's seat in the General Assembly (and perhaps on
                                preventing Peking from occupying a seat in the Security Council). If
                                we play our cards right—and if the Chinats don't commit political
                                suicide—we might even succeed in shifting the onus for Peking's
                                continued exclusion to the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time that we take the above moves, we should maintain all aspects
                        of our present <hi rend="italic">military containment</hi> of Communist
                        China—our assistance to Vietnam, Laos, India, and other nations of the
                        region; also, our resistance to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>
                        activities in Africa, etc. In other words, we should move toward treating
                        the Chinese much as we treat the Russians: an appropriately tough response
                        wherever or whenever they seriously cause us harm; but otherwise, a groping
                        toward coexistence on the basis of mutual self-interest.</p>
                    <p>I am under no illusion that the above moves would produce a change in
                        Communist China's behavior or its view of the United States. I strongly
                        believe, however, that these moves would give us a greater look of maturity
                        and self-confidence, far greater rapport with our major allies, increased
                        respect from the “third world,” a greater degree of maneuverability, and the
                        basis for long-term leverage with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s. We would also have less the look of a defeated
                        obstructionist by the end of 1965.</p>
                    <p>I would argue, in addition, that the U.S. political climate can bear the
                        weight of such moves—particularly if the President wins big next week.
                        (Press and Congressional reaction to the <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> China speech last year revealed a dramatic ebbing of
                        passions on the China issue over the past decade.)</p>
                    <p>I might add that I am well aware that much of this strategy is dependent upon
                        early decisions that must be taken with regard to the situation in South
                        Vietnam. I assume that we will have to choose roughly between escalation
                        towards negotiation on the one hand, and a muddle-through towards
                        negotiation on the other.</p>
                    <p>Even if we were to elect the first alternative, my China suggestions might
                        still make sense. On the basis of my own limited knowledge of the Vietnam
                        situation, however, I would hope that our choice would be the <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0154"/>second alternative. If so, my suggestions
                        would hardly run counter to this strategy.</p>

                        <p>There is a good deal of talk these days about the erosion of support for
                            excluding the Chinese Communists from the United Nations, and <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0155"/>about the related problem of
                            how to accomplish U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia. On both situations
                            we are in something of a box. This paper will argue that the same box
                            contains both problems; and while it is something of a Chinese puzzle,
                            we can escape from the box we are in.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Erosion and Opportunity</p>
                        <p>Contrary to widespread belief, the central problem in the Far East is the
                            military and political behavior of the Chinese Communists, not our
                            military and political response to that behavior.</p>
                        <p>On the military side we are doing what we can to contain <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> power without expanding the
                            Southeast Asian war or unleashing the Chinese Nationalists for an
                            invasion of the Chinese mainland. We have created something close to a
                            stalemate around the whole periphery of Chinese power from Korea to
                            India. But the Viet Nam salient of that stalemate is precarious in the
                            extreme.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s do not yet have reason to
                            believe they cannot win in Southeast Asia by applying patience,
                            pressure, and the principles of indirect aggression. They know how
                            fragile the Saigon government is—they are helping make it that way. And
                            they hear vocal elements in American politics proposing that we get out
                            of Vietnam, and get the United Nations in.</p>
                        <p>On the political side, the most recent soundings place the vote on
                            Chinese representation in the 19th General Assembly on the ragged edge
                            of losing by simple majority. Of our friends in this battle we can say
                            only, as Thurber said of his early colleagues at <hi rend="italic">The
                                New Yorker</hi>, that “some of them helped, with left hand and
                            tongue in cheek.”</p>
                        <p>Canada, Italy and many others are impatient to get on some new track that
                            is not vulnerable to the political charge they are “ignoring" the
                            world's most populous nation. The Africans are increasingly wobbly. The
                            French are increasingly unhelpful. Even so strong an opponent of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> admission as Paul-Henri Spaak has
                            now told us this Assembly is the last time around for him in the face of
                            mounting public and parliamentary pressure at home.</p>
                        <p>If we make enough of an issue of it, the British and a few others who
                            recognize Peking will probably stick with us in insisting a two-thirds
                            majority is required to change the representation of China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But at best we can hope to hold the line
                            on the traditional basis only through the present General Assembly. If
                            the line up of power in the Far East remains about the way it is, and we
                            do not change our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> tactics, we face a
                            serious defeat on the issue in the 20th General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Studying these facts, virtually every government in the world now
                            believes that we are gradually losing both the guerilla war in South
                            Viet Nam and the parliamentary trench war in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0156"/>
                        <p>And a growing number of governments now seem convinced (a) that there is
                            a better chance of taming the aggressive behavior of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s if they are admitted to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and subjected to peaceful
                            persuasion in its precincts; and (b) that the rigid posture of the
                            United States is somehow preventing an accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>(The evidence that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s can be
                            tamed by the application of sweetness and light is wholly lacking. They
                            are still mobilizing on India's northern border, stirring up the Pathet
                            Lao, subverting Cambodia, supporting the attack by North Viet Nam on
                            South Viet Nam, and threatening Formosa—and they are still at war with
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself in Korea. They have
                            exploded a nuclear device and will doubtless now add nuclear blackmail
                            to their kit of tools.)</p>
                        <p>This picture of our friends and allies leaving the sinking ship of U.S.
                            policy is not overdrawn; but what it reveals is not their defection from
                            the anti-Communist cause, but their defection from our existing
                            policies. After all, most of the relevant political leaders in the world
                            do not favor Chinese Communist influence; they fear it. They do not want
                            Southeast Asia to become a peninsula of China; they just don't believe
                            we can prevent that outcome in the way we are trying to prevent it. They
                            do not look forward to the day the Chinese enter the United Nations;
                            they merely regard it as historically inevitable.</p>
                        <p>In other words, <hi rend="italic">what is eroding is not the opposition
                                to Communist China's behavior, but the support of our traditional
                                tactics for dealing with it</hi>.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows Section II, “Military Firmness and Political Flexibility,”
                            and the first 9 pages of Section III, “Political Perspective.”]</p>
                        <p>Even to get started on this political escalator would require enormous
                            changes in the attitudes and ambitions of the Chinese Communists. In
                            steps 2 and 4, it would also require far-reaching changes in the
                            attitudes and ambitions of the Government of the Republic of China—in
                            return for the maintenance of its name and identity, and its control
                            over Formosa, it would be abandoning the “return to the Mainland,”
                            liquidation of its own Security Council veto, and acceptance of the
                            People's Republic of China as, in effect, the senior one of the two
                            Chinas.</p>
                        <p>It is not likely that we will have to cross many of these difficult
                            bridges any time soon. Indeed, the danger of getting started down this
                            somewhat slippery road at all is made remote by the implacable hostility
                            of the Chinese Communist leadership. They will surely insist for quite a
                            while that they won't come into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            unless Taipei is thrown out and Peking gets not only the China seat in
                            the General Assembly but the veto in the Security Council as well.
                            Moreover, the Chinese Communist leaders, who are still the veterans of
                            the Long March, have some reason to believe that their kind of toughness
                            pays off: French recognition, Western trade credits, Khrushchev's fall
                            and the political fall out of their own nuclear test all bear
                            witness.</p>
                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0157"/>
                        <p>But if we were to indicate to the world our willingness to move down a
                            peaceful road by negotiated steps at a negotiated speed (while
                            increasing our military pressure to demonstrate that we do not regard
                            fighting and talking as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing
                            policies), we would place on the Chinese Communists, where it belongs,
                            the onus for delaying its own acceptance into the community of nations
                            and the United Nations peace system.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, we should not at first have to do more than (a) insist that
                            changes in Chinese behavior are an essential to an accommodation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s on its relationship to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; and (b) indicate that Laos and
                            the Nuclear Test Ban are the obvious places to start testing China's
                            willingness to be in fact a part of the world community. Later, while
                            the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> item is being discussed in
                            the 19th General Assembly, we could (c) indicate our willingness to join
                            in setting up a “study committee" on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>, to report to the 20th General Assembly in 1964.
                            (Such a tactic was approved for possible use in last year's General
                            Assembly, but was not used since we clearly had the votes to beat the
                            Albanian resolution on its merits.)</p>
                        <p>Clearly the traditional structure of the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> issue, which has (remarkably) served us well for a
                            decade-and-a-half, is eaten away at its very foundations. Our major
                            allies, France and Britain, will not help us maintain it and most of our
                            other significant allies, from Italy and Belgium around to the
                            Philippines and Japan, are hanging on only for fear of what it would do
                            to their relationship with us if they were to let go.</p>
                        <p>Our cue, surely, is to find a way of mobilizing all of the world's
                            nations that oppose the way the Chinese Communists are using their
                            power, in a new strategy that puts the primary stress on future
                            improvements in Chinese behavior.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> began by saying
                        that he had talked with the Canadian Foreign Minister and had been asked by
                        him to convey to the Secretary the Foreign Minister's present thinking on
                        the problem of Chinese representation at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Canadians, on the basis of extensive checking, are of
                        the opinion that on an Albanian-type resolution the General Assembly would
                        vote 53 in favor, 45 against, with 15 abstentions. This possibility argues
                        for taking a long look at the China representation question between now and
                        the beginning of the General Assembly session rather than between the 19th
                        and 20th sessions of the General Assembly, as had been suggested earlier.
                        The Canadians are aware of the importance of America's relations with the
                        free countries of Asia and, of course, recognize domestic sentiment in the
                        United States. They are also aware of domestic considerations in Canada
                        which are more favorable toward the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. Because of these factors, the Canadians feel that they
                        would not oppose an Albanian-type resolution as they had in the past. With
                        respect to the “important question,” Canada would vote affirmatively despite
                        uncertainties that the resolution would carry. The Canadians under the
                        circumstances are considering the possibility of introducing a declaratory
                        resolution which would support a two-China solution at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he would like to speak with the President about the
                        Canadian views and accordingly would withhold full comment until after he
                        could do so. Nevertheless, he thought it should be pointed out that the
                        problem is not so much with the domestic reaction in the United States or
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reaction as it is with Peiping. If the
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s continue on their present
                        aggressive course, there will be war in the Pacific. Unless they realize
                        there is opposition to their present course, <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0159"/>they will conclude that they are doing fine. So far as we
                        know not one of the free world countries represented in Peiping has
                        expressed to the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s criticism of
                        their actions during the past two years. Paradoxically, it is now argued by
                        some that the Chinese explosion of a nuclear device is a reason for
                        admitting them to the United Nations, yet the same voices would loudly
                        condemn the United States and seek to throw us out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had we done so.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> said that the
                        problem in part was based on the mathematics of the vote. The Secretary
                        noted that in this connection Article 19 comes into play since a number of
                        votes counted one way or another by the Canadians “have to be paid for.”
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> gave the Secretary
                        the Canadian analysis of the country-by-country vote. The Secretary said
                        that we would check the Canadian figures against our own for there may be
                        different views on certain ex-French-African countries and others. Our
                        assessments can be compared on November 17 when Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> goes to Ottawa for
                        discussions there. The Secretary again emphasized that the reaction in
                        Peiping was in our view of central importance. Looking ahead we could see
                        the possibility that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw
                        Pact countries could work out their problems without war. We are not so sure
                        about Peiping.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> asked if
                        the views expressed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> reflected the joint Belgian-Italian-Canadian
                        assessment. The Ambassador said that they did not and that, in point of
                        fact, the Canadian view reflected the Minister's present thoughts on the
                        subject rather than a firm policy decision of the Government of Canada.</p>

                        would be irretrievable. The Canadians, for instance, were deserting us for
                        the first time. As of now, we had a slight simple majority on our side, and
                        we might have to revert to asking for a 2/3 majority (“important
                        question”).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> then reminded the President that there was more
                        to it than just what we might do this year: Could we get support for a
                        2-China policy? What was to be done about the seat in the Security Council
                        where the U.S. has the veto? Peiping certainly would not come into the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> unless it got the Security Council
                        seat. This was the matter of seeing how things look that are not going to
                        happen this year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said that unless we start
                        to shift our policy this year, Taiwan would be, at any rate, totally
                        replaced in a few years. We could just allow this to happen or we could
                        begin to shift toward a 2-China policy. The <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s might withdraw on their own initiative. He recalled
                        that the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s refused to accept
                        recognition from France when France recognized Communist China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> thought we must study the
                        alternatives: admit the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and throw
                        the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s out; adopt a 2-China policy;
                        get somebody to propose a study group (which is bitterly opposed on Taiwan
                        as the beginning of the end); get the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s into disarmament talks. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> told the President that we would need guidance as
                        to how to go about it. He did not think we should continue frozen, which
                        would in the near future damage our prestige. We could move toward a 2-China
                        policy, which the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s won't accept
                        anyway.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what would happen to the Security Council seat if
                        Communist China got into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would get it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> reminded the President that we could keep the
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s out by using the veto which
                        was what President Kennedy had said he would do. But the U.S. never had used
                        the veto and did we actually want to use it in the Security Council year
                        after year to keep the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s out.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated to the President that the matter of war and peace lay in
                        the Pacific. If we appeared to falter before the Soviet Union and Communist
                        China this would be interpreted as a reward for the track they have been
                        following, and this would increase the chance of war. If we were to make a
                        move that would signal to Peiping that we were weakening, this would
                        increase our danger. The Secretary agreed with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> that something must be done—perhaps the
                        establishment of a study committee that would allow the matter to fall into
                        complete confusion for an indefinite period.</p>
                    <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0161"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said the sooner we moved
                        the better. He recalled President Kennedy had said that President Eisenhower
                        had told him that “the only thing that will bring me back into politics is
                        to bring China into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that President Kennedy might have been
                        using President Eisenhower's remark as an umbrella for his own policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that it might be necessary for the President to
                        telephone Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> and
                        impress upon him that we must not make a move that will be interpreted as
                        weakness in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President agreed</hi>. He then turned to the
                        Philippines and recalled that there had been offers from the Philippines to
                        give us support in South Vietnam, but that our military leaders had regarded
                        this offer as embarrassing because, if it were accepted, the Chinese would
                        come in. The President recalled that we had been appealing for more flags
                        and more units instead of ambulance units and that this was an offer of what
                        we wanted and the military had turned it down.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> and the Secretary remarked that Max Taylor and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would be very
                        disappointed to hear this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> repeated that the U.S. must
                        be prepared for a loss of prestige unless we were willing to move forward on
                        a 2-China policy in this session—the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would not accept it anyway. To stand fast with people
                        dropping away right and left—especially the French Africans—was not right.
                        We should not stand still and be overwhelmed by the waves. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> noted, however, that the matter
                        would not come before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> until
                        January.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s remarks impressed him; that perhaps
                        better than abandoning our policy and inviting strong partisanship in
                        Congress, the President said that what gave him pause was Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement that to change
                        would be a pay-off for the Soviet and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> hard line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said that he and others had
                        felt for a long time that we should get the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s into the community of nations—then you could manage
                        them better.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted that he did not pay the
                        foreigners at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to advise him on foreign
                        policy, but that he did pay <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
                        that he was inclined to listen to him.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that there was no real basis for some of our allies
                        wanting to get the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There had been no effort on the part of our
                        friends to level off with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s on
                        the problems that we jointly faced with Peiping. There had been no effort on
                        the part of the French, for instance, to get at the heart of the matter.</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0162"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said that nevertheless
                        there were 700 million people not represented in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as against a few million of the Kuomintang on Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> pointed out that, while it
                        was true that our position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                        eroding, it was important to remember that it had lasted for fifteen years.
                        The Secretary said this was correct; that he had invented it fifteen years
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> thought one approach we
                        should make would be to go to those who favor admission and emphasize the
                        behavior of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s on the
                        international scene and say, in effect, “unless your behavior is better, you
                        can't get in.” Many <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members say we are
                        standing in the way of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> admission
                        but it is the Chinese Communists themselves.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> remarked that it was just as we are
                        being blamed now for denying the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> its
                        vote in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that this would
                        be the last General Assembly in which we could use the standing tactic on
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> thought we could succeed
                        this year only if we indicated that there was movement in some way toward a
                        new approach.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> wondered why
                            <persName>Martin</persName> would wish to change the Canadian vote. Both
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> said it was because it would be politically
                        popular.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said that he had travelled
                        into nine states during the fall and that he had found the people far ahead
                        of the Congress on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought it a far less domestic problem
                        than an international one. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>
                        said that, as he travelled through the country, the people asked him about
                        Article 19 and <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>. He said it was
                        difficult to give out all the old answers—there were often bad editorials.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> recalled that there had
                        been movement on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> under President
                        Kennedy when he agreed to abandon the Eisenhower position of a moratorium
                        and, instead, to discuss the problem—this had been a step forward. He said
                        he did not know how much longer we could hold the line.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> Thoughts</hi>. The real
                        problem we face on <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> policy is far
                        less one of substance than of tactics.</p>
                    <p>Most people agree that, after 15 years of sustaining a rigid policy against
                        Peking (and rather successfully at that), the erosion of our position is
                        forcing us to take a different tack. Even the general nature of this tack is
                        not really at issue—we want to retreat gracefully from an increasingly
                        isolated position toward a stance which puts the onus for continued friction
                        more on Peiping and less on us. In effect, we want to make our <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> policy more like that toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—tough where they push us but
                        flexible where there's something to be gained, if only in terms of
                        willingness to talk.</p>
                    <p>So the real question is no longer whether to disengage from the more rigid
                        aspects of our China policy but how and when. On this essentially tactical
                        question, the two extremes are either to take the initiative ourselves in
                        order to minimize the loss and maximize our control over the consequences,
                        or to let ourselves be pushed reluctantly by the pressures of the
                        international community. By and large, however, it is simply unrealistic to
                        expect us to say boldly we were wrong about our China policy. This isn't
                        good domestic politics, and great nations don't win kudos abroad by
                        admitting mistakes and saying mea culpa. So our posture must be one of
                        saying that, although we haven't changed our views on the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> threat, we reluctantly accept the
                        verdict of the international community that China should be admitted to the
                        club. Even so, we're still confronted with the question of how long to hold
                        out before confessing, and what terms, if any, we can exact in return. Our
                        decision on this when and how should take into account a whole series of
                        factors, including those discussed below.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>

                                <hi rend="italic">How much domestic backlash</hi>? I'm one of those
                                who feel that the China question has tended to become de-politicized
                                with time. It's hard to tell how much residual emotion it can yet
                                arouse, or how much the Republicans could exploit it. Not only does
                                the President's new mandate <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0165"/>itself give him some room to maneuver, but this mandate was partly
                                a vote for cautious responsibility in a nuclear world. So what the
                                President does under the “peace" rubric generally nets out at a big
                                plus. In this sense Peiping's nuclear test actually serves as a
                                reason why we should enter into a dialogue with Peiping on such
                                issues as arms control.</p>
                            <p>Peiping's test also dramatically underlines that <hi rend="italic">Red China is here to stay</hi>. It destroys what's left of the
                                Gimo's thesis that the civil war is still on (he knows it, too, poor
                                man). Even <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> has read this lesson.
                                Moreover, the Sino-Soviet split (which will continue even if in
                                muted form) provides further public justification for dealing with
                                both Communist centers, not only one.</p>
                            <p>Despite all this, however, there's no blinking the fact that <hi rend="italic">a shift in our policy will look like a
                                defeat</hi>—whenever it occurs. This is the price we have to pay for
                                having successfully maintained a fixed position for so long. Peiping
                                is wholly unlikely to change its spots sufficiently to justify our
                                shift on these grounds. To the contrary, one of the best arguments
                                for shifting our policy is to pin the onus for its own intransigence
                                more squarely on Peiping.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">So the real issue is when and how to shift our China
                                policy in a way which will minimize our losses—both domestically and
                                abroad</hi>. And the real argument against doing so is that we can't
                            afford it when we face a crunch with Peiping over Vietnam. To me, this
                            was the central point in LBJ's 18 November talk with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            argument was that easing up on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>
                            now would make us appear to “falter" in the Pacific at just the wrong

                                <hi rend="italic">Thus our decision on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>, etc. turns largely on how we play
                                    Vietnam</hi>. If we appear to cut and run or to be losing, it
                                will be domestically and internationally impossible to “make
                                concessions" on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> too. Nor
                                would it be possible if we were “negotiating" (except theoretically
                                as additional frosting on a negotiated settlement). But isn't the
                                corollary also true? If we take a tougher stance in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>, if there is widespread fear abroad
                                of US escalation—it can hardly be taken as a sign of undue weakness
                                to be flexible on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>. In
                                fact, we could use this counterpoint as a justification for our
                                    <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> policy; it would demonstrate
                                that while we were determined to resist Communist aggression, we
                                were simultaneously prepared to deal with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s wherever there was some
                                peaceful purpose to be served.</p>
                            <p>In effect, I see increased pressure in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> as permitting greater flexibility on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>—as supporting our contention
                                that we don't seek a US/<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                                war, and even that we are “escalating to negotiate.” Paradoxical as
                                it might seem, we could walk both sides of the street, thus helping
                                to protect ourselves both from accusations we're seeking to do in
                                Peiping and from complaints we're faltering in the face of the
                                enemy.</p>

                            among the neutralists), we will have started off the 19th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> with a crashing victory. To a degree at
                            least, this too would provide a shield behind which we could be more

                            falter. Indeed, the bigger our Article 19 victory, the more the

                            <hi rend="italic">How do we best preserve the position of Taiwan</hi>?
                            To be coldly realistic, Taiwan is our ultimate card in any eventual
                            modus vivendi with Peiping, and by the same token the bargaining counter
                            to be preserved at all costs. But we can no longer tell ourselves with
                            any conviction that trying to ostracize Red China is the best way to
                            protect Taiwan. To the contrary, the longer we insist on an “either-or"
                            choice, the more we will force the wrong choice from our point of view.
                            What we need to do is to stem the rapid erosion of Taiwan's
                            international position by getting it internationally recognized that
                            China is a divided country (like Germany, Korea, and Vietnam). To do
                            this we have to pay the price. I'm not suggesting we opt for “Two
                            Chinas" yet;<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">The word “yet" is a handwritten
                                insertion on the source text.</note> what we want to do is to get
                            others on a “Two China" kick as the tacit price for our ostensible
                            willingness to let Peiping into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            It's the only real counter to an Albanian-type resolution.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Peiping has recently made clear again that it won't come in unless Taiwan
                        goes out. Fine—this will buy us another few years of maneuvering room if
                        only Taipei will play it smart and not withdraw. I'm not optimistic,
                        however, as the Gimo (at his advanced age) is more interested in face than
                        in practical politics. So appealing to <persName>Chiang</persName>'s finer
                        sensibilities would get us exactly nowhere. Ergo, once we decided to move,
                        I'd put it hard and cold to the Gimo—if he pulled out of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, we'd regard ourselves as relieved of our
                        commitment to veto <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> admission to
                        the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The above doesn't really get to the tactics of when and how to alter our
                        China policy. It merely gives my slant on some of the key variables. I have
                        some thoughts on tactics and timing but I'll not overload the circuit for
                        the moment. My main point is that our ability to be flexible on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> may well turn largely on our
                        decisions re Vietnam. Since the latter will almost certainly be upon us
                        first, time enough for the latter later.</p>

                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> handed the
                        attached long rambling letter<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">Telegram 452 from
                            Taipei, November 23, transmitted the text of the letter. Telegram 456,
                            November 24, reported <persName>Chiang</persName>'s comments to Wright
                            when he gave him the letter. Both are attached to the source text.

                        Ambassador he asked that you be told of his feeling that with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> test the situation in Asia had
                        entered a critical stage—more critical than at any previous time.</p>
                    <p>The gist of the letter itself is that (1) the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, not the Soviets, are the greatest threat today; (2)
                        they are engaged in a protracted war of attrition in Southeast Asia, the
                        only answer to which is a quick US victory; and (3) the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear test poses a new dimension of
                        threat, chiefly to the morale of Free Asians.</p>
                    <p>The Gimo then calls on the US to: (1) urgently develop a strategy for quickly
                        winning the war in Vietnam; (2) take leadership in developing an “overall
                        plan" for concerted action by the Free Asian peoples themselves to overthrow
                        the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s before it is too late (e.g.
                        equip and unleash the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>); and (3) if this
                        is not possible just now, immediately give the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> the wherewithal to destroy the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear installations. He asks for an urgent reply.</p>
                    <p>We see this letter as essentially aimed at reminding you of the Gimo's
                        well-known views at a time when he senses we must be rethinking our China
                        policy. While he couches his letter in terms of a series of proposals he
                        knows we can't accept, his chief aim is probably to forestall any weakening
                        of our position on the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> issue in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. State will draft a proposed
                        answer.</p>

                            area. I expressed interest in this statement, and said we would be glad
                            conform meticulously to these agreements if only others would do
                            same.</item>

                        <item>I took liberty some omissions and some changes in guidance for opening
                            statement, partly because I wanted emphasize absence polemics and desire
                            for constructive proposals and partly because we could not find
                            references for some of quotes paragraph 1, and feared
                                <persName>Wang</persName> might ask who said them and when. Hope
                            Department can give documentation all quotes in subsequent
                            guidance.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> obviously unprepared for moderate tone my
                            opening statement, since he misquoted me three times in his response,
                            assuming that I would naturally say things which in fact I did not say.
                            He paid no attention to my plea for no polemics.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>As for next meeting, I see no value in lengthy and sterile polemics. I
                            think both sides really know the score, so there is little to gain in
                            propagandizing each others home offices—ostensibly our only audiences
                            until the historians come in. Since two sides differ so basically on so
                            many issues this admittedly leaves little room on constructive side of
                            ledger. Hence if Department agrees, I would propose simply give somewhat
                            shorter responses than has been our habit, adequate to keep record
                            straight, but leaving lengthy preachments up to
                                <persName>Wang</persName> (he enjoys them so). This would preserve
                            inherent value of holding talks per se, and retain them for time when
                            they can again serve specific useful purpose. For present, Chinese
                            clearly interested in talks only as propaganda forum.</item>

                    <p>Minister <persName>Martin</persName> said that, although he opposed a
                        postponement of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> over Article 19,
                        he would be happy to see a postponement to delay a showdown on the Chinese
                        question. The Secretary said he could see some advantage from that point of
                        view and also to let certain aspects of the Congo question cool off. With
                        regard to the Hanoi-Peiping situation, we will see what the other side is up
                        to in the coming dry season. We feel strongly that anything that causes the
                        Chinese Communists to think they are on the right track is a step toward
                        war.</p>
                    <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0172"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> said he understood the Secretary's feelings and,
                        because they get along well, they can be frank with each other. The Chinese
                        issue has gone beyond the point where he could do anything to turn back his
                        government. The Canadians are, however, resolved not to do anything without
                        the fullest disclosure and consultation. Although their talks with the
                        Belgians and the Italians have been serious, these are not at all as
                        thorough as they undertake to carry on with the United States.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> said they would not be honest if they did
                        not say they had reached the point where they must speak out. They cannot
                        delay action any longer.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what action could not be delayed. We certainly want to
                        delay a war with China if possible. <persName>Martin</persName> agreed. The
                        Secretary said something that deeply distresses us but which may have the
                        seeds of a suggestion is the fact that in the past two years apparently no
                        country with relations with China has expressed concern to Peiping over its
                        policies in Southeast Asia. Perhaps when Canadian diplomats are in touch
                        with Communist Chinese, they could express the Canadian attitude toward
                        Chinese aggression. When the Chinese react negatively, the Canadian
                        Government could draw the obvious conclusions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> said his government had no contact at all with
                        Peiping, which is symptomatic of the unreality of the present situation.
                        When the Canadian Broadcasting Company planned to do a series on China,
                            <persName>Martin</persName> asked the <gloss target="#t_CBC1">CBC</gloss> representative to pass on unofficially some thoughts to the
                        Chinese leaders. The man saw <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou
                            En-Lai</persName> three times and told him forcefully that the Canadians
                        hoped the Chinese attitude on Indochina would enable Canada to do what it
                        believed right in the interests of universality in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>
                        replied that this was an old argument, that no one is taking over Indochina,
                        but that no one could stop the march of events; in any case, Canada is
                        merely a satellite of the United States and will do nothing without the US
                        approval. Members of the wheat mission to China had also tried to talk to
                        the ChiComs but the latter said they did not want to talk politics with
                        wheat experts. This illustrates that the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                        has done what it can to convey its views to Chinese leaders.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> said that, speaking as a friend, he must say
                        that if the Chinese question comes up at this <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and if the vote on substance is close, within perhaps two
                        votes of a majority, the Canadian position as a nation would be impaired for
                        a long time if it did not vote favorably. On the Important Question, Canada
                        would be with the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> had been in Ottawa when Conservative MPs had asked
                        why the government did not act on China, and if the government was afraid of
                        the United States. <persName>Martin</persName> had talked with Barbara Ward,
                        who reflected State Department thinking on this issue. She, however, seemed
                        to see something in a parity proposal to protect Formosa's position. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> recognizes the difficulties in
                        making any such proposal but feels that if the Chinese question comes up
                        Canada should <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0173"/>say something to
                        protect the rights of Formosa. <persName>Martin</persName> recalled in this
                        regard that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had asked
                        in a television speech what should be done for Formosa and whether it was to
                        be thrown to the wolves. The Secretary commented that if Canada maintained
                        diplomatic relations with Formosa, Peiping would not allow Canada to
                        establish relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> said that his government's assessment of the
                        voting alignment in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> on ChiRep is not
                        good. The Secretary asked what Canada would like to see in Southeast Asia
                        and on the western rim of the Pacific. <persName>Martin</persName> replied
                        that Canada would naturally want to see peace all over the world, but none
                        of us can avoid recognizing that the Chinese will exert increasing
                        influence. This is not in Canada's interest, nor is it in Canada's interest
                        to have a Communist regime in Russia. But there it is. To make an
                        ideological identification of one's enemies is not the right approach.
                        Coming into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will not alter the
                        aggressive tendencies of any state, but it will provide that much more
                        contact. The Secretary commented that inclusion in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might confirm the aggressive tendencies of
                        Peiping. He could understand, however, if Canada helped the ChiComs in this
                        way if they were willing to put a division into Southeast Asia to help
                        contain Peiping's expansion. <persName>Martin</persName> said this was an
                        unfair argument to use with “little fellows" such as Canada that could not
                        put its troops in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Cyprus and
                        everywhere else. If there should be a war, it is axiomatic that Canada would
                        be alongside the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> said he had recently asked the Russian
                        Ambassador to Canada what the Soviets would do if the Canadians supported
                        admission of China, and had commented that Chinese admission would pose some
                        difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Ambassador
                        had nodded at this statement.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Soviet attitude, the Secretary said that if the Russians
                        had become more cautious lately, it was not because of their contacts in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but because of their direct contacts
                        with the United States, and because <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        solidarity had convinced them that they must stop pressing. In addition,
                        since the beginning of the cold war the U.S. defense budget had totalled
                        some 700 billion dollars. With regard to China, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he was disturbed by the view that
                        Chinese domination of Southeast Asia is unavoidable. Would
                            <persName>Martin</persName> say this was equally true of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Iran? <persName>Martin</persName>
                        said that it was inconceivable that a nation of 700 million people would not
                        share the authority and influence of Japan and India in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the same relationship held between the United
                        States and Canada. <persName>Martin</persName> said it did indeed, so much
                        so that he had hesitated to speak in this frank way despite his great
                        personal esteem for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.
                        The Secretary commented that we would never object to a relationship between
                        China and Southeast Asia along the lines of the United States-Canadian
                        relationship.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary asked what the public reaction in Canada would be if the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> published an account of what the <gloss target="#t_CBC1">CBC</gloss> man had reported of his conversation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>. Secretary
                            <persName>Martin</persName> said that this would make no difference.
                        People in Canada would tell the government to show that Canada is not a
                        satellite.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would be in touch further on the subject and it would
                        certainly be discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It would be
                        of some importance to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> since US
                        interests could easily swing to the Pacific if the situation there grows
                        more serious. He would also be giving <persName>Martin</persName> data on
                        increased infiltration in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> recalled that Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had told him that the situation
                        in South Vietnam could go on a thousand years. He could not believe it.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we certainly
                        believe our contribution to security in Europe might have to go on a
                        thousand years, or as long as it is needed. We see no terminal date for it.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> said that he had suggested to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName>, as he could not suggest to a
                        Secretary of State, that he should not use such arguments because they do
                        not touch reality. Bringing China into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        would not affect these issues one way or the other. They would affect many
                        people in Southeast Asia; for example, Catholics would be offended beyond
                        words, but this would be temporary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he appreciated Minister <persName>Martin</persName>'s
                        frankness. It should be quite clear, however, that if all of our allies in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> do not feel deeply concerned about
                        how China may be turned away from aggression, there could be bad results in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as we are forced to turn to
                        problems of the Pacific. <persName>Martin</persName> said that the
                        difficulty for the Canadians is that they do not believe entry into the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would affect this situation. It would
                        be a long process, but it cannot start until we “mingle.” He had talked with
                        Ikeda six weeks ago in Tokyo. The Japanese want to take part when the
                        Chinese question is resolved, although perhaps the new government will have
                        a different idea on timing. He had also talked with Spaak recently who does
                        not go quite as far as the Canadians but feels that resolution of the
                        Chinese question cannot be delayed much longer. The Canadians are not much
                        concerned about the recognition issue, but would want to overcome this at
                        the same time as ChiRep. They would probably regard <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> admission as constituting recognition.</p>

                        islands and China shipping. He asked that I recommend speeded delivery of

                            delivery of Bullpup missiles was therefore not warranted; it recommended

                    </p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much for your letter of November 23 and for your
                        congratulations on my election. I greatly value your views on the present
                        situation in Asia and have given them close attention.</p>
                    <p>The aggressive policies being pursued by the Chinese Communists are indeed a
                        grave menace to all free nations. As both our countries have learned through
                        the years, they are a menace which has many facets—psychological and
                        political as well as military—assuming different forms and dimensions in
                        different parts of the world. Our task must be to bring about the highest
                        possible degree of Free World vigilance and solidarity in defense against
                        the Communists' designs.</p>
                    <p>The United States is fully alive to the Chinese Communists' aggressive
                        designs against Taiwan. You may be assured that the American people regard
                        their Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China as one of their basic
                        international commitments, and that their determination to stand by it would
                        in no way be weakened by Chinese Communist development of nuclear weapons. I
                        believe that the continuing strength of our alliance will deter the Chinese
                        Communists from any thought of a nuclear attack on Taiwan, as the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance has deterred the Soviet Union
                        from an attack on Western Europe. We are considering the deployment of
                        additional fighter aircraft to Taiwan from time to time to enhance the
                        strength of our defense posture, if you agree this would be of value.</p>
                    <p>The United States is fully conscious of the Chinese Communists' plan to
                        deprive the Republic of China of its place in the United Nations, to destroy
                        the Republic of China and to seize Taiwan. Against these <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0177"/>threats too the United States will continue
                        to give your Government full support.</p>
                    <p>I greatly appreciate your sharing with me your thoughts as to actions we
                        might take to meet the Communist threat. So far as the objective of
                        restoring the mainland of China to freedom is concerned, I believe we should
                        continue to be guided by the principles you and the late Secretary Dulles
                        set forth in the communique of October 23, 1958. As was agreed then, success
                        against the Communists is to be won principally by political means, not by
                        force. The United States Government has no evidence of increased popular
                        restiveness on the mainland or of a weakening of the Communists' internal
                        controls; and it doubts that present political conditions favor the taking
                        of military initiatives.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe the United States can presume to assert leadership in Asian
                        affairs; but I agree with you that closer consultation among Asian countries
                        could bring important benefits to the Free World cause. The United States
                        would welcome an Asian initiative for such a purpose. In this regard, the
                        United States, as you know, attaches the highest importance to normalization
                        of relations between Japan and Korea. I greatly appreciate what your
                        Government has done to foster the establishment of friendly relations
                        between these two countries and hope you will continue your efforts.</p>
                    <p>You mention your deep concern for the situation in Southeast Asia. The United
                        States has just ended a review of the situation there and of the policies
                        best suited to frustrate the Communists' aggressive policies. We feel we
                        must take steps to improve the politico-military situation in the area; yet
                        the fragility of political conditions in South Viet-Nam hampers us. As your
                        Government was recently informed in confidence, we are undertaking moderate
                        increases in air activity directed at the infiltration problem and are
                        prepared to take certain other measures in retaliation against Viet Cong
                        actions of any special nature. It is our purpose to impress upon Hanoi that
                        the United States Government is not moving in the direction of retreat but
                        is prepared to respond to Communist pressures by stepping up the level of
                        its activity in Viet-Nam. The United States is of course looking beyond the
                        immediate future, but we must bear in mind that additional actions in
                        Viet-Nam must be based upon a reasonably secure situation in the south of
                        that country.</p>
                    <p>In the years ahead I look forward to a further strengthening of the
                        friendship between the Republic of China and the United States and to many
                        future exchanges of views between us.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName>Johnson</persName> joins me in sending our warm regards to you
                        and Madam Chiang for Christmas and the New Year. Sincerely yours,</p>

                                <item>There is no military requirement to modify US commitments at
                                    this time. The present ChiCom nuclear capability has not
                                    materially affected the existing balance of military power
                                    between the United States and Communist China; however, the
                                    expansion of this capability will pose difficult problems in the
                                    future. Maintaining and using in forward areas, as appropriate,
                                    flexible forces with both a conventional and nuclear capability
                                    becomes most important to provide visible evidence to our
                                    allies, as well as to the ChiComs, that the US defense
                                    commitment is firm. We should anticipate pressures which would
                                    result in requests by threatened countries for more definitive
                                    guarantees, including increased nuclear support.</item>

                                    World nations in Asia cannot develop a capability for defending
                                    themselves without US support. Japan should be encouraged to
                                    increase its defense efforts, providing improved conventional
                                    forces for use in the common defense of Asia and providing
                                    military assistance to other nations in Asia. Asian nations
                                    should continue to provide conventional forces.</item>

                                <item>Should pressures build up to the point that our Asian allies
                                    believe the development of a national nuclear capability to be
                                    clearly in their national interest, refusal to provide some form
                                    of nuclear assistance would put the United States in a position
                                    of denying to valued allies a nuclear capability possessed by
                                    the common enemy. The United States, therefore, should not rule
                                    out the possibility of increased nuclear support including some
                                    form of nuclear sharing with our allies in Asia when such is

                        <item>Communist China's first nuclear test on 16 October 1964 was of an
                            implosion fission device with <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 as the
                            fissionable material [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>]. We cannot estimate with confidence its
                            weight or dimensions but believe it was relatively large and heavy. The
                            most likely source of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 was
                            uranium first brought to partial enrichment in the gaseous diffusion
                            facility at Lanchou and then further enriched by the electromagnetic
                            process. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 was of Soviet or other non-Chinese
                            origin though we believe this to be highly unlikely.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Although we have no good basis for estimating the current level of
                            production of fissionable material, we believe that the Chinese will
                            have enough material during the next two years to conduct a test
                            program, with enough left over to stockpile at least a few bombs. The
                            Chinese could now build bombs based on the results of their first test
                            which could be carried by their two TU–16 medium jet bombers or their 12
                            or so TU–4s.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The evidence leads us to estimate that the Chinese Communists are
                            developing a medium-range ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>). We believe this system is essentially a Soviet
                            design, probably the SS–4, perhaps with some Chinese modifications. It
                            is possible that the Chinese could have a few <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s ready for deployment with compatible fission warheads
                            in 1967 or 1968. A weapon in bomb configuration could be available
                            somewhat earlier and could be delivered by the Chinese air force's light
                            jet IL–28 bombers of which they have about 290.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>The Chinese have a submarine closely similar in outward appearance to
                            the Soviet G-class submarine which is designed to launch 350 n.m.
                            ballistic missiles while surfaced. We do not know whether the Chinese
                            built this submarine or assembled components supplied by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or what missile they expect to put
                            in it. We have no evidence that the Chinese are constructing any more of
                            this type submarine and it would be at least several years before any
                            units could be operational with Chinese-produced missiles.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets provided the Chinese with some surface-to-air missiles
                                (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s) by mid-1960. We have no
                            evidence to confirm or deny that the Soviets have furnished any more
                            since then and we do not know how <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0182"/>many such missiles are now in China. The Chinese have
                            an urgent requirement for <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s and we
                            believe are working hard on a production program. There are indications
                            that the Chinese are now producing some kind of surface-to-air missile,
                            either Soviet-type <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s or prototypes of
                            a Chinese version. The evidence is not sufficient to permit a firm
                            judgment but we think it highly unlikely that either will be produced on
                            a large scale for two or three years.</item>
                        <label>F.</label>
                        <item>It is unlikely that the Chinese will develop a deliverable
                            thermonuclear weapon for several years, and there is little chance of an
                            intercontinental capability until after 1970.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> opened saying because of defeats suffered in
                            Viet-nam we had recently sent planes to raid North Viet-nam, against the
                            Geneva Agreements and thereby spreading the war. These criminal actions
                            jeopardize peace, arousing condemnation all peace-loving peoples of the
                            world. The Chinese Government made two statements on February 9 and 13
                            which make clear action against Viet-nam is action against China. U.S.
                            defeat in South Viet-nam is foregone conclusion. Outcome Viet-nam war
                            must be decided on the ground. In Chinese view long as U.S. continues
                            present course Viet-nam people will continue deal heavier and heavier
                            blows until U.S. is kicked out. It is U.S. which has invaded South
                            Viet-nam and taken the lead in breaking up the demarcation line. Only
                            one way out for U.S.: withdraw and let the people of Indochina settle
                                <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0183"/>their own problems. Up to
                            U.S. to decide road to be taken. <persName>Wang</persName> said the more
                            we go on expanding war, the surer is our defeat.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> continued, claiming tension Far East is caused
                            by U.S. occupation Taiwan, mentioning Polaris subs in Asian waters and
                            aircraft capable carrying nuclear weapons in area. Said press was saying
                            purpose was destroy all main cities of China. Chinese Government has
                            long pointed out nuclear blackmail will not intimidate Chinese people.
                            Mentioned serious warnings since last meeting and “spy planes" shot
                            down. Said seven groups comprising 196 men of the
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> clique had raided mainland and no good
                            could come from our support such actions.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> said my statement was prevarication to cover
                            up our aggressive acts. Everyone could see we had violated Geneva
                            Agreements in moving U.S. troops to South Viet-nam and spreading flames
                            of war so as to carry out armed aggression to slaughter large numbers
                            Vietnamese people. Facts cannot be covered by pretext. Said we claimed
                            Hanoi was masterminding. This is nonsense. Obviously aggression will
                            cause struggle against aggression. It is United States who forced people
                            South Viet-nam to take up arms. Only correct way to settle this question
                            is for U.S. to implement Geneva Agreements in good faith. U.S. must
                            immediately stop war of aggression, withdraw troops and armament, and
                            let South Vietnamese people settle own problems by selves. Said we lied
                            in saying we came into South Viet-nam to protect freedom and have no
                            selfish aims.</item>
                        <label>(5)</label>
                        <item>I said <persName>Wang</persName> knew as well as I what he said untrue
                            and I had stated true U.S. position. U.S. clearly prepared observe
                            Geneva Agreements if others would. Reminded <persName>Wang</persName>
                            had spoken of closeness between China and North Viet-nam and in such
                            case believed could not avoid all responsibility for what was going on.
                            Problem could be simply resolved if North Viet-nam authorities called
                            off their aggression. We cannot abandon South Viet-nam. We willing leave
                            South Viet-nam if North Viet-nam would stop interfering in South
                            Viet-nam.</item>
                        <label>(6)</label>
                        <item>
                            <persName>Wang</persName> said China and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> are fraternal countries and at same time close
                            neighbors and rely on each other. Therefore U.S. aggression against
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is just like aggression against
                            China. Said if we insist on spreading war flames to North Viet-nam,
                            China will definitely not sit idly by. China does not want war but must
                            make clear its determination. If U.S. continues its aggression China is
                            prepared to carry on to the end. If U.S. really means to abide by Geneva
                            Accords it must first withdraw its troops.</item>

                            views. Said we blamed North Viet-nam for fighting in both Viet-nam and
                            Laos and asked what we were doing in Laos. Asked what is the reason U.S.
                            launched attacks in Cambodia. Is this also fault North Viet-nam. Said
                            that we had spread war to North Viet-nam. North Viet-nam has right to
                            strike back and signatories Geneva Agreements also have right to act
                            against United States aggression. The situation really grave now and if
                            U.S. refuses withdraw it will be held fully responsible for all the

                            right for them to pursue so-called wars of liberation but not right for

                            developed with scale of U.S. aggression there. <persName>Wang</persName>
                            said it was our usual practice to call all revolutionary movements
                            Communist-backed, but this is simply attempt cover up our own
                            aggression. Only way out is to withdraw troops from South Viet-nam. Said
                            only practical thing was for countries having nuclear capability to
                            agree not to use it on each other.</item>

                        Talk with Chinese Ambassador <persName>Wang</persName> in Warsaw
                        yesterday:</p>
                    <p>In the one hour and forty minute meeting nothing new of significance was
                        noted. In both content and delivery, <persName>Wang</persName>'s statements
                        were less heated than they might have been expected to be under the
                        circumstances—less, for instance, than after the Tonkin Gulf incidents.</p>
                    <p>Still, he claimed that an attack on North Vietnam was the same as an attack
                        on China and made it clear, as he had previously, that China supports “wars
                        of liberation,” including this one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> did use some intemperate language, such as at one
                        point, he called what I said re US policy in Vietnam “lies.” In view of my
                        guidance, I did not respond in kind to the degree I might have otherwise.
                        Also, in view of the tenor of the guidance, I conformed this time to its
                        wording almost verbatim.</p>
                    <p>In this meeting, <persName>Wang</persName> predictably put on record Chinese
                        views designed to justify intervention in case of future need. (In addition
                        to the above, his claim is that we have now destroyed the demarcation line,
                        and our bombing of North Vietnam has legitimized retaliation by the
                        signatories of the Geneva agreements.)</p>
                    <p>I scarcely think his statement indicated that intervention is planned for the
                        moment, at least. In fact, the most notable feature of the meeting was the
                        relative lack of bluster or any show of confidence.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> did not even attempt to prolong the meeting as
                        he has done in the past, presumably to cause press speculation he had read
                        the riot act to us. Upon entering the meeting room, too,
                            <persName>Wang</persName> was, if anything, a little more friendly than
                        usual.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese immediately accepted the April 21 date.</p>

                        range of questions pertaining to Communist China's military establishment.
                        The Chinese Communist regime's intensive and highly effective security
                        measures make China, in general, a difficult intelligence target. Estimating
                        the nature and scope of the Chinese military production effort is made more
                        difficult because much of the program is still in the developmental and
                        factory construction stages. We are thus unable to make confident judgments
                        on many important matters concerning the nature, scope, and prospects of
                        Chinese Communist military developments and this paper should be read in the
                        light of this general caution.</p>

                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>Communist Party influence permeates all levels of the Peoples
                            Liberation Army (the entire Chinese Communist military establishment).
                            The senior political and military leaders are united by ties of
                            comradeship in a long revolutionary war. Political commissars are
                            assigned to every command down to company level. Although the troops are
                            conscripts, they are selected for political reliability and receive
                            constant political indoctrination. (Paras. 12–13, and para. 1 of Annex
                            B)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The Chinese Communists continue to proclaim the military doctrine of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> which stresses
                            self-reliance, the dominance of men and politics over weaponry, and the
                            concept of a protracted “people's war.” This doctrine, deemed applicable
                            to “wars of national liberation,” <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0187"/>is also applied to a potential conflict with the US.
                            Communist China is apprehensive regarding the possibility of a US
                            nuclear attack followed by a large-scale invasion, but holds that in
                            such a case China could accept nuclear devastation and still overwhelm
                            the invaders in a protracted “people's war.” The Chinese leaders hope
                            that this prospect will deter the US. (Paras. 6–10)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The Chinese leaders, however, cannot derive much comfort from this
                            rationalization of their present strategic situation. Since coming to
                            power in 1949, they have steadily sought to modernize their military
                            establishment. They have considered it a matter of first importance to
                            develop an independent nuclear capability. (Paras. 1, 11)</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>Communist China's military power derives primarily from the numerical
                            strength of the Chinese Communist Army (<gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss>), some 2.3 million men, and tremendous reserves of
                            manpower. Although the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> is
                            essentially an infantry force, its capabilities for combat are
                            formidable. In open warfare against modern opposition, it would be
                            hampered by shortages of armored equipment, heavy ordnance, mechanical
                            transport and <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>. In mountainous or
                            jungle terrain, these shortages would be of less importance. In 1961,
                            many Chinese units had serious shortages of equipment and were
                            understrength. The Chinese have sought to ameliorate this situation by
                            bringing up to strength and fully equipping selected divisions. We
                            estimate that as many as one-third of the combat divisions have been so
                            improved, and are distributed throughout most of China's military
                            regions. We lack the information to make any confident estimates of
                            present production rates of specific items of army equipment, but
                            Communist China has sizable facilities for the production of such
                            materiel. We believe that the production at land armaments plants has
                            increased over the low 1960–1963 level and that it will continue to
                            increase. (Paras. 15–17, 28, 38, and paras. 1–10 of Annex B)</item>

                        <item>The mainstay of the Chinese Communist fighter force in the air force
                            and navy is the some 1,600 <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-15s and
                                <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17s. There are also about 150
                                <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19s and 25 to 35 <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s. Except for the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s, these aircraft are obsolescent and
                            probably less than 10 percent of these fighters have airborne intercept
                            equipment. The backbone of China's air offense would be the 270 or so
                            IL–28 jet light bombers. They also have 12 or so TU–16 medium bombers
                            capable of carrying a bulky nuclear weapon. Attrition has taken its toll
                            of aircraft in service and the Chinese aircraft industry is only now
                            approaching the capability to arrest this decline. The Chinese have been
                            adding to all of their aircraft development and production centers, and
                            there are indications that they are getting ready to produce the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19, or the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21 and may, indeed be in the early stages of
                            production. We believe the chances are less than even that production of
                            bombers will begin during the next two or three years. (Paras. 22, 27,
                            41–43, and paras. 1–7 of Annex A)</item>

                        <label>F.</label>
                        <item>The primary mission of the Chinese Communist Navy (<gloss target="#t_CCN1">CCN</gloss>) is coastal defense. Its major
                            combatant units are 21 operational W-class submarines, 4 Gordy-class
                            destroyers, 4 Riga-class destroyer escorts, and 14 patrol escorts. The
                                <gloss target="#t_CCN1">CCN</gloss> also has about 155 motor torpedo
                            boats. The capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_CCN1">CCN</gloss>
                            against modern opposition would be limited by obsolescent equipment and
                            probably by substandard combat proficiency of its crews. We believe the
                            Chinese have placed a high priority on construction of submarines. We
                            estimate that by mid-1966 the Chinese Communist naval order of battle
                            will include 25 W-class submarines. (Paras. 15, 25, 44, and paras. 8–11

                        <label>G.</label>
                        <item>The Chinese have given top priority to their nuclear weapons and
                            missile programs. On the basis of our scanty evidence, we estimate that
                            the Chinese, over the next two years, will be able to carry out a
                            nuclear test program and stockpile about 10 bombs. In the ballistic
                            missile field, we believe the Chinese are developing a medium-range
                            missile (1,000 n.m.) modeled on the Soviet SS–4. It is possible that by
                            1967 or 1968 the Chinese could have a few such missiles with compatible
                            fission warheads. The Chinese almost certainly are determined to develop
                            a nuclear strike capability against US territory. This determination
                            could be reflected in the initiation of programs in the near future
                            looking toward longer run development of a limited number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and the construction of a small
                            fleet of missile carrying submarines. Even if the Chinese have already
                            begun work on such programs, we believe that they could not pose a
                            threat to the US until sometime after 1970. (Paras. 51–52, 56)</item>

                            revive from the severe setbacks it suffered when the Great Leap Forward
                            collapsed and the Soviets withdrew most of their assistance in 1960. We
                            believe the Chinese leaders will sustain substantial military production
                            even at the risk of serious economic difficulty. However, China's
                            economy will not be able to support anything approaching a maximum
                            production effort by all sectors of military industry and in coming
                            years the Chinese will have to make a number of difficult decisions
                            regarding priorities. We cannot predict in what quantities Peiping may
                            decide to turn out the various items of equipment, and there is a good
                            chance that the Chinese themselves do not yet see their way clearly.

                        <item>Nevertheless, barring some major setback, Communist China's military
                            power will gradually grow and this growing power will almost certainly
                            increase Peiping's political leverage against its Asian
                            neighbors—whether or not Chinese Communist leaders actually engage in
                            direct hostilities or commit armed forces abroad. (Paras. 53, 55)</item>

                    <p>869. On March 20 President <persName>Chiang</persName> held special meeting
                        for discussion <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and requested Ambassador
                        to attend. Present were Admiral Gentner, <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss>; General Sanborn, <gloss target="#t_CHMAAG1">CHMAAG</gloss>; General Peng, Chief of General Staff; Minister of
                        National Defense <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> and
                        Major General Hu, liaison.</p>
                    <p>This message in three parts. First deals with possible second nuclear
                        explosion and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> concern of shortage of ADC
                        equipment. Second part (<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs,
                        priorities and deliveries). Third part—conclusions.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>
                            <p>Part 1. President stated all intelligence indications are that second
                                atomic blast by ChiComs is about to take place. It is possible that
                                this will be delivered from the air. This possibility brings our
                                attention to area of air defense. President indicated ChiComs have
                                15 TU4 aircraft. Our air defense system just cannot afford even one
                                of them to come through and deliver the weapon. After looking into
                                present status of missiles, President not satisfied with number of
                                missiles (Nike-Hercules and Hawk) on hand. President noted that at
                                present we have only a few missiles per launcher. This certainly
                                will not be adequate. Fortunately this fact is not known to general
                                public. If it were it would cause feeling of panic among general
                                public to know that we only have a small number of missiles on hand.
                                Therefore, President requests that ground-to-air missiles
                                (Nike-Hercules and Hawk) which are already programmed be delivered
                                expeditiously. If possible we would like to have some extra missiles
                                stored here in reserve. President also mentioned need for more
                                air-to-air Sidewinder missiles.</p>
                            <p>In addition to missiles the President also mentioned the importance
                                of maintaining aircraft support. He referred particularly to spare
                                parts program. Some of them, he stated are at very low stock
                                level.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <p>Part 2. President referred to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>65
                                Military Aid Program. He mentioned some of the items, funds for
                                which have already been approved and their delivery has been
                                programmed, such as Bull Pup missiles and F 100 modification kits,
                                M113 (<gloss target="#t_APD1">APD</gloss>), and M 41 tanks.
                                President feels that these items, since they are already programmed
                                should be delivered with the highest priority.</p>
                            <p>President hopes thorough review be held with regard to equipment and
                                weapons status of 15 forward look divisions in the five-year
                                program.</p>

                        <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0190"/>
                        <item>Part 3. In conclusion, President mentioned during the past he has
                            asked the Ministers and Agencies to discuss problems of economic aid and
                            military aid with American counterparts and he has not previously
                            discussed these with Ambassador himself. He is not satisfied with
                            attention given Military Aid Program in Washington. He does not
                            understand why items already appropriated for and programmed have not
                            been delivered. <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> should receive
                            highest priority in military aid next after South Vietnam. President
                            feels Military Aid Program is critical and US Govt has not, so far,
                            given <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> enough priority in delivery of
                            military priority items. He urged Ambassador to convey his view to US
                            Govt.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>First meeting with Defense Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> took place
                        Monday, March 22, to discuss shortages mentioned by President and get into
                        priorities for 15 forward look divisions. Will be reported through military
                        channels.</p>
                    <p>Comment: Following should be noted: First, that these are view of President
                        not subscribed to by US Embassy or military commanders. Second, this is
                        first time detailed military requirements have been placed on echelon of
                        President to Ambassador. Third, we believe that President is concerned with
                        what he considers deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. His greatest
                        concern, however, is with propaganda effect of prospective second ccne,
                        particularly if it is an air drop.</p>
                    <p>Specific comment on part 1: We have on several previous occasions emphasized
                        to President and his principal supporters that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s best air defense is US nuclear deterrent. However,
                        President has consistently downplayed its effectiveness against ChiCom
                        probable intentions, particularly toward <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. He states need for a military air defense system as only
                        defense his people will understand. We believe US deterrent is better
                        understood and appreciated by his principal subordinates, political and
                        military.</p>
                    <p>President states desire for more ground-to-air missiles although he has a
                        full battalion allowance. They do not have trained personnel to handle more
                        at present.</p>
                    <p>Parts 2 and 3: It is obvious President has not been kept up to date by his
                        subordinates on details of programs and deliveries, although <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has made all pertinent information
                        available to them. The five-year program is under constant review and
                        discussion by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> representatives.</p>
                    <p>Recommendations: It is obvious that we must continue our efforts to sell
                        President on US nuclear deterrent as his best air defense, emphasizing our
                        defensive commitment to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which is as
                        strong as that to any other free nation. We cannot provide complete air
                        defense for all nations liable to nuclear attack.</p>
                    <p>With respect to remaining points on shortages and delays in delivery, I have
                        directed <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to prepare detailed
                        presentation of present <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0191"/>status all
                        items, which will be delivered direct to President. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will contact Dept of Defense for up-to-minute
                        information.</p>
                    <p>A special <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>-US committee will be
                        established in <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> to study Communist
                        nuclear threat and how best to meet it. <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss> will coordinate US participation. Any recommendations
                        which committee may produce as to accelerated deliveries will be forwarded
                        through military channels.</p>
                    <p>Unless Dept desires action different from above or has amplifying information
                        not available here, I do not see any instructions needed in addition to
                        current <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs. Would appreciate any
                        views Department may wish to convey to President in addition to above,
                        particularly with respect to his comments on Washington policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">Telegram 927 to Taipei, March 25, replied that the

                    </list>
                    <p>On Friday, April 9, I had the following at the Residence for lunch: the
                        Minister of Defense, General <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName>; Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                        General Sanborn; CG 13th Air Force General Wilson; and interpreter S.K. Hu.
                        The purpose of the lunch was to discuss certain important military matters
                        with the Defense Minister.</p>
                    <p>I stated that at our March 20 meeting with the President he had expressed
                        very grave concern over the condition and capabilities of the <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0192"/>Republic of China's air defense. I said the
                        President had stated the Communists had 14 TU4's and when they had developed
                        a nuclear weapon these 14 planes could be used for an attack on Taiwan. The
                        President stated that with the current state of air defenses it would be
                        impossible to assure that at least one of these planes would not penetrate
                        the air defense net for a nuclear attack on the Island. The President had
                        asked that a missile allowance be increased to guard against this
                        contingency and that the current status of aircraft spares be increased to
                        provide more effective employment of intercept aircraft. The President had
                        requested also that the Republic of China be given high priority in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> allocations, particularly in air defense.
                        The President had stated that his principal concern was public consciousness
                        of the vulnerability of air defenses and their apprehension about air
                        defense weaknesses if the present shortages of equipment were publicly
                        known.</p>
                    <p>I told the Minister of Defense that we appreciated the President's thoughts
                        in this matter. I said that no air defense system, however elaborate, could
                        guarantee against the penetration of a small number of planes. I stated that
                        even the air defense system of the United States was inadequate to give this
                        assurance. I stated also that having no anti-missile capability, U.S.
                        defense against a missile attack was probably non-existent. I stated that in
                        realization of this fact the United States had placed the maximum air
                        defense reliance on the Strategic Air Command and that retaliatory
                        capability of this organization was the principal contributing factor to our
                        deterrence against such a nuclear attack against the United States. I stated
                        that by far the largest component of our military expenditures in the air
                        defense field were allocated to the Strategic Air Command.</p>
                    <p>I stated also that the deterrent effect of this nuclear capability was
                        equally applicable and effective in the air defense of Free World nations
                        which were associated with or allied with us in opposition to the Communist
                        threat. I stated that our strong defensive alliance with the Republic of
                        China has certainly placed them in this category and that the entire
                        retaliatory capability of our nuclear forces would be equally effective in
                        deterring an attack against Taiwan. Recognizing the possibility of
                        penetration of Taiwan air defenses by Chicom aircraft, I said that this was
                        most unlikely in the face of the probability of large-scale U.S. retaliation
                        against the Communist mainland.</p>
                    <p>I stated that I shared the President's concern in the ability to convince his
                        people of the strong defensive potential of our retaliatory forces and that
                        I would do anything I could along these lines to assist him in informing and
                        educating his people of the unlikelihood of any nuclear attack on Taiwan
                        against the possibility of retaliation by the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0193"/>
                    <p>Generals Sanborn and Wilson seconded my thoughts and, in addition, added the
                        thought that Chinese defense systems as they were were in excellent shape
                        and although many more forces could be used, those which we had would make a
                        good showing for themselves in the event of an attack. Both emphasized the
                        need for good organization and coordination with the forces and facilities
                        which the United States might make available.</p>
                    <p>The Minister expressed appreciation for our thoughts and said that the
                        President was principally concerned with the factors of time and space. He
                        said the Formosa Strait was a very narrow body of water and therefore the
                        time interval in which an attack could be conducted was extremely short. He
                        said it was his opinion an active joint study should be conducted which
                        would develop the maximum coordination of Chinese and United States efforts
                        in the matter of air defense.</p>
                    <p>I replied that the committee recently established and consisting of the
                        Minister, Admiral Gentner, General Sanborn and their respective assistants
                        had been charged with a detailed study on air defense matters and that the
                        findings of this committee would be available to both our governments. I
                        assured him that the United States would give very careful consideration to
                        anything this committee might propose.</p>
                    <p>Comment: I think the meeting was extremely useful in bringing to an important
                        member of the Government and a close associate of the President our thoughts
                        on the value of our nuclear capability in deterring an attack on Taiwan. In
                        our previous contacts with the President he has tended to ignore this
                        deterrent and has concentrated on getting more military hardware for air
                        defense. We will continue to keep the facts of air defense life before both
                        the President and all of his principal military and political advisors with
                        the hopes of generating a greater appreciation of the unlikelihood of Chicom
                        nuclear attack on Taiwan against the likelihood of United States
                        retaliation.</p>
                    <p>I then raised the question of the 20 per cent increase in the military
                        budget. I stated that the military budget was a matter entirely internal to
                        the Republic of China. I stated, however, that an increase in the budget
                        must be at the expense of funds available for the economy. We of the United
                        States sincerely hoped that the economy could continue to grow at the rate
                        which over the past two years has made such a tremendous impression on the
                        outside world and be of such enormous benefit to the people of the Republic
                        of China. I said any slow-down in economic growth of the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> would be sure to have an adverse effect in
                        their world position, both politically and commercially, and particularly
                        would affect their ability to borrow needed funds in the international money
                        market. I sincerely hoped, speaking for the U.S. Government, that military
                        expenditure would not prevent a continuation of this very satisfactory
                        economic growth.</p>
                    <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0194"/>
                    <p>The Minister of National Defense stated that he appreciated my thoughts on
                        the matter and that the effect on the economy of the increased military
                        budget had been carefully considered by the economic branches of the
                        Government. It has been decided that the effect would not be damaging.</p>
                    <p>Comment: In the minds of myself and my assistants I believe it is inevitable
                        that there will be increased inroads into funds otherwise available for
                        economic growth in order to meet the demands of the military establishment,
                        particularly in those fields in which U.S. military aid is being reduced. We
                        will continue to observe this important matter and bring it up with the
                        higher echelons of the government as necessity and occasion arise.</p>

                    <p>As a follow-up to my preliminary travel report of March 29,<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">In his March 29 memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported briefly on a 2-week trip to the

                                <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName> Memos)</note> I
                        offer the following comments and recommendations on the situation in Taiwan.
                        I must stress that these views reflect only a 48–hour visit; they also
                        reflect, however, extensive conversations in Washington and elsewhere in the
                        field, both before and after my trip.</p>
                    <p>The key word in Taiwan's present apparent health and longer-term sickness is
                        “stability”. Most of our current actions—and all of our current <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0195"/>inaction—are explained in terms of the
                        maintenance of stability. Where, one is asked, can one find a more stable
                        nation in all East and Southeast Asia than the Republic of China? Why upset
                        the apple cart?</p>
                    <p>The problem is that underneath the surface lie major factors of instability.
                        As long as we minimize them or pretend that they don't exist—and as long as
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> does the same—we are courting bad
                        trouble in the very near future.</p>
                    <p>I identify three chief problem areas, all of which are interrelated:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>From both Chinese and Americans (I talked to no Taiwanese) I developed a
                        disturbing impression of a severe and deepening crisis of morale on the part
                        of most elements of the island's population. It is a new and particularly
                        significant factor among the mainlanders. Its ingredients appear to be: <list>

                            <item>The growing awareness, on the part of most of the emigres, that a
                                return to the mainland is simply not in the cards. It is probable
                                that a good many have doubted the feasibility of return for sometime
                                now; but the Chicom nuclear explosion has confirmed their
                                doubts.</item>

                            <item>Poverty and corruption. The present low ceiling on civil service
                                salaries cuts across the bureaucracy, the military and all teachers,
                                thereby forcing educated mainlanders to scrape along at
                                below-subsistence levels of income. For officials, this makes
                                corruption essential to survival. My Chinese informants tell me that
                                corruption has spiraled over the past two years, and there is no end
                                in sight. To quote one fortunate mainlander, whose salary is double
                                the civil service norm because he works for a joint Sino-American
                                outfit: “All my friends in the bureaucracy are doing it; and if I
                                were in their place, I would be doing exactly the same thing.” As
                                for academics, they have had to support themselves by holding down
                                two and three jobs simultaneously for some years now. One additional
                                by-product of low civil service salaries is inadequate police pay,
                                hence poor police protection and a very high rate of petty
                                crimes.</item>

                                heavy hand of the party is an obstruction to creative talent in the
                                bureaucracy; the big black limousines and the 30-course feasts of
                                the party bigwigs add to the demoralization of their impoverished
                                underlings. Although the Generalissimo continues to live and preach
                                austerity, his retinue are prime offenders (and have outdone

                                political docility of the Taiwanese is a result of the relative
                                prosperity of the farmers and businessmen as well as their sense of
                                the futility of political action; it is not a result of increased

                    </p>
                    <p>In our own diplomatic establishment we face a classically dangerous
                        situation. I talked at length with seven of the younger Embassy and Agency
                        China specialists. They were all bright and articulate, largely free of
                        visionary zeal. They were unanimous in their bitter complaint: that the
                        upper echelons of the Embassy will not permit reporting of the facts of life
                        in Taiwan. When I pressed them to clarify their meaning, I was told that
                        reporting which tends to contradict the current U.S. “line" on the stability
                        and prosperity of Taiwan is suppressed. In particular, the reporting of
                        group attitudes, as detected by these younger officers—the attitudes of
                        enlisted men, of mainland lesser bureaucrats, of mainland intellectuals, and
                        of various Taiwanese groups—is strongly discouraged, either through the blue
                        pencil or a refusal to pass such papers forward (a “gentleman's agreement"
                        that such things are not helpful to report).</p>
                    <p>I regarded this as a very serious charge and said so; but my informants stood
                        their ground.</p>
                    <p>As far as I can determine, this Embassy gap between young Turks and their
                        seniors has been a Taiwan problem for some years. In its currently acute
                        form, it is largely a reflection of the attitude of the present Ambassador,
                        as implemented by his senior associates. There are also, of course, certain
                        factors endemic to Taiwan: the exploration of group attitudes, particularly
                        among Taiwanese, inevitably causes concern on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> security establishment, and this concern is

                        personnel. If your primary purpose is not to “upset the apple cart”, it is
                        safer to discourage such snooping.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, however, there is a rather more urgent objective to be
                        served: that policy makers in Washington be adequately informed of what
                        underlies the surface stability of Taiwan. That objective is not now being
                        served. The dangers are compounded by the inevitability of political change
                        once <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is removed from
                        the apparatus he has controlled and balanced so skillfully for 35 years—and

                        <hi rend="italic">3. The High Costs of Ambiguity</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I came away from Taiwan deeply disturbed by the debilitating effects on both
                        Chinese and Americans of a non-credible but unquestioned myth: the myth of
                        return to the mainland.</p>
                    <p>On the face of it, the situation is rather eerie: the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> knows that we don't believe it; and we know that they know
                        we don't believe it; and we suspect that some of them don't believe it; but
                        no one says it. The result is that our every relationship is affected by the
                        unmentionable dead cat on the floor.</p>
                    <p>I am most concerned by two costs that are paid out for continued ambiguity:
                        the emotional and intellectual cost, and a more tangible cost in the
                        allocation of economic resources.</p>
                    <p>In the first category, the general effect of any over-riding myth is to make
                        most serious discussion impossible. In the case of Taiwan, the ambiguity is
                        a breeding ground for continuing suspicion of the U.S. and for latent
                        anti-Americanism. As long as we make a pretense, by silence, of sharing
                        their myth, we are subject continually to the charge that we are not true
                        believers—and, by extension, that we are going to betray their interests. In
                        permitting the ambiguity to linger, we hand to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> a considerable instrument of leverage against us: leverage
                        to force us regularly to prove what cannot be proven, i.e., that our hearts
                        are in the right place on this issue. To assuage our guilt and sustain the
                        ambiguity, we have to keep offering up bits and pieces of concessions.
                        Finally, I might add, ambiguity permits some U.S. officials to begin to
                        believe in the myth.</p>
                    <p>The second category of cost relates to the first. As long as the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is tacitly encouraged to honor the myth,
                        its economic planning will be geared to implementing that myth through the
                        maintenance of a foolishly massive defense establishment. One of the
                        tragedies of Taiwan is the fact that the resources do indeed exist to make
                        it a “garden spot”, a “beacon of free Chinese development”, and a “showcase"
                        for the mainland and the rest of Asia. As one Chinese friend told me, “This
                        place is obviously a paradise relative to the mainland; but the tragedy is
                        that it could have been and could be so much more—a free, dynamic and
                        prosperous alternative to the mainland.”</p>

                    <p rend="center">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the foregoing analysis, I would conclude that the U.S. has a
                        major interest in assuring that Taiwan's apparent stability and prosperity
                        become real stability and prosperity. I would also conclude that we have
                        certain instruments to achieve this result which we are not now using.
                        Specifically, I suggest the following actions: <list>

                                the Embassy's present malaise or of moving with skill and swiftness
                                in the fluid situation that may develop after the Generalissimo's

                                by 15 percent next year; but this is clearly inadequate in terms of

                            learned about the President's speech. Said we claimed be ready for
                            unconditional discussions for peaceful settlement but he thought this
                            was simply a swindle. Said we had torn up Geneva Agreements and launched
                            aggression and were now trying to play with peace hopes to save
                            ourselves from defeat, but this impossible. When we were bombing day and
                            night, how can we claim to be ready for peaceful negotiations. President
                            said US must be prepared for long conflict. 24 hours after President's
                            speech there was large-scale bombing. In week following there were new
                            landings of forces and more planned. <persName>Wang</persName> claimed
                            President actually laid down three preconditions, according to what I

                                    would not withdraw under the cloak of meaningless agreement.
                                        <persName>Wang</persName> said this was aimed at legalizing
                                    our aggressive actions; also aimed at forcing Viet-nam people
                                    recognize we have right to act as we please, that is, US demands
                                    equal unconditional surrender to which we would never get
                                    agreement. Also claimed US plan spend $1 billion was gross
                                    insult. US would meet with failure attempting to buy over people
                                    with a few stinking dollars. US should listen carefully to the
                                    voice of Vietnamese people who determined fight to the end if US

                            <persName>Wang</persName> spoke of air engagement Hainan, calling it act
                            of direct military provocation against China. Said he would like launch
                            strongest protest. Said when engagement made public US Defense
                            Department had guilty conscience and tried to hide true meaning.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> handed to me two photos as evidence of
                            “crime.” These showed alleged wreckage downed US plane (forwarded with
                            verbatim text). But this was not only case of military provocation
                            against China. Since last meeting 365th through 377th serious warnings
                            issued, indicating US had stepped up its provocations. Had intruded
                            several times into airspace Hainan Island, fired on Chinese fishing
                            boats near Hainan and given pursuit into territorial waters. US had
                            repeatedly sent spy planes over China and <persName>Wang</persName> made
                            strongest protest, demanding US put immediate end to military

                            joint maneuvers, delivery newest weapons, and visits of brass to Taiwan.
                            Said US even had plans let Chiang gang occupy Hainan Island and brag
                            about breaking through Chinese coastal defenses. Said If US linked up
                            Chinese civil war with its war of aggression, more disastrous
                            developments were in store for US.</item>

                            Said at same time we made clear what we expected get out of discussions
                            but these were not conditions. I stressed firmness American purpose wage
                            war for sake of people South Viet-nam. I suggested lesson of Germany and
                            Japan could apply Wang's side if they continued present policies. Re
                            Hainan engagement, I quoted Sylvester press replies with additional
                            sentence from guidance telegram. Then spoke of American prisoners as
                            instructed. Again stressed importance of 17-nation appeal, asking when
                            Chinese reply could be expected.</item>

                            negotiations my remarks indicated we would continue war at any cost or
                            risk; US attempting intimidate peoples by war threats but this would not
                            succeed. Repeated favorite phrase about Viet-nam and China being
                            interdependent and close as teeth and lips; two peoples were brothers
                            sharing same weal or woe, and aggression against North Viet-nam was
                            aggression against China. China as one of signatories Geneva Agreements
                            had right to safeguard them. US has torn them up.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> followed with long description of US
                            alleged aggression in South Viet-nam over past years. Said recently we
                            had carried out all manner atrocities including burning people alive and
                            taking out their internal organs. We are not <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0201"/>only using conventional weapons but poison gas and
                            napalm. Said US more cruel than Hitler. These acts could not be
                            permitted by Vietnam, China and world's people. Root cause of war was US
                            aggression and futile try shift blame on others. Only way settle problem
                            was withdrawal US troops from South Viet-nam. If aggression continued
                            debt of blood must be repaid in blood. U–2 and pilotless planes often
                            intrude Chinese airspace and three of them shot down were now on display
                            in Peking. Warned once again if US did not end violation Chinese
                            sovereignty it would certainly be punished. US also had sole
                            responsibility for acts of <persName>Chiang</persName> clique.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> said “we do not fear you.” Added if

                            that <persName>Wang</persName> claimed Chinese entirely approved North
                            Vietnamese response but I had not seen text of that and did not wish

                            then spoke at some length of chronology aggression in Southeast Asia,
                            saying our support to South Vietnamese had come long after North
                            Vietnamese had aggressed against South, which proceeded even before ink

                            imperialistic policies of US.” Said even in Washington large number of
                            people had risen up against our policies demonstrating before the White
                            House. <persName>Wang</persName> listed number of alleged violations
                            Geneva Agreements on our part but these have all been covered before.
                            Claimed we had turned South Viet-nam into experimental ground for
                            practicing special warfare. Re American prisoners said they had offended
                            Chinese law and of course must receive sanctions of that law. This was
                            question Chinese sovereignty. Said exchange newsmen had always been

                                <persName>Wang</persName> again accused US of being world's
                            gendarmes, of using gangster's logic in our policies.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> said Chinese never engaged in subversive
                            activities in other countries but certainly would support liberation
                            movements which were just, because people of world had had enough of <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0202"/>imperialistic oppression and

                            Chinese government had ever recognized McMahon line and China had not
                            made single step outside its legal territory. It was futile for US use
                            India as base from which launch attacks on China. Said Chinese did not
                            like to make relations between China and US tense, but if US compelled
                            them they had no other way out.</item>

                            for us meet earlier. <persName>Wang</persName> then suggested June 30. I
                            replied while I was aware it was Chinese turn to set date, I would still
                            prefer a much earlier date than that suggested.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> said he still would like to plan for June

                            time, meeting could always be called by either side. I said with that
                            provision I would accept date on which he was insisting. (I shall of

                        <item>We believe that the principal aims of Chinese Communist foreign policy
                            over the next few years will be as follows: (a) to eject the West,
                            especially the US, from Asia and to diminish US and Western influence
                            throughout the world; (b) to increase the influence of Communist China
                            in Asia; (c) to increase the influence of Communist China throughout the
                            underdeveloped areas of the world; and (d) to supplant the influence of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the world at large,
                            especially in the presently disunited Communist movement. (Para.

                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>These objectives, and the method and style with which they are
                            pursued, are shaped by ideology, by Chinese tradition, by the apparatus
                            of power which the present Chinese Communist leaders can bring to bear
                            to achieve their ends, and by the personalities and experience of these
                            leaders. As a result, their foreign policy in some ways resembles an
                            international guerrilla struggle which attempts to wear down the enemy's
                            strength by attacking the weak points. (Paras. 2–16)</item>

                        <item>For both ideological and nationalistic reasons, China regards the US
                            as its primary enemy. Peiping's immediate security interest and the
                            short reach of its military power lead it to concentrate its main
                            foreign policy efforts on undermining the US position in the Far East,
                            though in other parts of the world the Chinese Communists are also using
                            such means as they have to weaken the US. Among other “capitalistic"
                            nations, which Peiping sees as in some sense victims of US exploitation,
                            Peiping tries simultaneously to build up recognition of China as a major
                            power and to weaken the US position of leadership. (Paras. 17–20)</item>

                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has come increasingly to
                            rival the US as a dominant problem for Chinese foreign policy. China
                            recognizes the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a pioneer
                            Communist nation and as the most powerful member of the Communist camp.
                            Yet nationalistic and ideological factors join to create a strong
                            enmity. The Chinese leaders will continue to seek the overthrow of the
                            present Soviet leadership, but without great hope of seeing the
                            emergence of new men who would follow the Peiping line. Elsewhere in the
                            Communist world, Peiping will seek to dilute or supplant Soviet
                            influence and to win over or split Communist parties and front
                            movements. (Paras. 21–24)</item>

                        <item>Peiping has chosen the underdeveloped, ex-colonial world as its most
                            advantageous arena of conflict. In this “Third World,” the Chinese not
                            only aim to erode US strength but to displace Soviet influence; they
                            seek to establish themselves as the champions and mentors of the
                            underdeveloped nations. The greatest impact of Peiping's policy is felt
                            in Southeast Asia. The theater of primary interest is Indochina, where
                            Pei-ping is seeking a decisive and humiliating defeat of the US. To
                            date, the Chinese leaders have not made risky countermoves to the
                            limited US attacks in North Vietnam, and they almost certainly seek to
                            avoid a wider <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0204"/>war.
                            Nevertheless, they have been making preparations for at least limited
                            engagement, and we believe that they would be prepared to risk a major
                            military conflict with the US should they feel China's vital security
                            interests threatened by US actions. (Paras. 25–28)</item>

                        <item>In the rest of Southeast Asia, unless the situation alters sharply,
                            Peiping is likely to support policies designed to maintain and increase
                            pressure against the US. Peiping seems to look on Africa as a second
                            great area of opportunity and is likely to increase both its overt and
                            subversive efforts on that continent. (Paras. 29–33)</item>

                            likely to be well beyond the period of this estimate, Peiping's dynamic
                            and aggressive attitudes will persist. Moreover, though we have little
                            information concerning the next generation of leaders, there are many
                            reasons to believe that China's foreign policy will be assertive and
                            uncompromising for a long time to come. (Para. 39)</item>

                        without US technical assistance. Any larger scale action would require US
                        support. Hainan is far beyond range of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>

                    <p>Possibility remains that ChiComs might be misled by statements in Taiwan

                        demarche considered necessary for this reason, it be directed toward
                        discouraging press statements and those small-scale actions which <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> capable of taking on its own. We would not
                        say to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> there may be virtue in keeping

                        and thus provoking undesirable ChiCom reaction toward Vietnam. If such
                        demarche is made while bombing of North Vietnam suspended, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> likely to attribute significance to timing.
                        We cannot judge here whether this desirable or not and request further

                    </list>
                    <p>On May 14th the Zablocki (Far East) Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs
                        Committee issued a report on the Sino-Soviet conflict which includes, inter
                        alia, the following recommendations: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The United States should give, at an appropriate time, consideration
                                to the initiation of limited but direct contact with Red China <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0206"/>through cultural exchange
                                activities with emphasis on scholars and journalists;“</p>
                            <p>and,</p>
                            <p>“The recognition of Outer Mongolia should be considered.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>These two thoughts are tired old chestnuts that have been kicked around in
                        the Government since at least the first months of the Kennedy
                        Administration. As you know, inter-agency agreement has been achieved more
                        than once on a lifting of the travel ban (either specifically for Red China,
                        or across the boards; also, either for special groups—scholars, etc.—or for
                        all citizens). Similar agreement has been reached more than once on
                        recognition of Mongolia. But both proposals have foundered because “now is
                        not the time.”</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that “now" is never going to be the right time—and that right
                        now is actually as good a time as we may ever find for making one or perhaps
                        even both moves.</p>
                    <p>This conclusion was reinforced by my Far East trip in March. At Baguio, in
                        Hong Kong, in Taiwan and in Japan I discussed possible U.S. initiatives
                        towards Communist China and Mongolia with many of our leading State and
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> specialists. In all cases there was
                        general agreement—as there has been in the U.S. Government since 1961—that
                        our national interest would be served by recognition of Mongolia and by a
                        unilateral freeing of U.S. travel to Communist China. More important, I also
                        found general agreement that the present climate of U.S. firmness in
                        Asia—our Vietnam air strikes, the dispatch of ground forces, etc.—was ideal
                        for such moves that might be judged superficially to be “soft”. (Typically,
                        such proposals had not been sent to Washington by any of the people with
                        whom I talked; the fact of the matter is that no post abroad considers
                        itself an “action desk" for U.S. relations with Communist China—a situation
                        that is costly to our Government, I fear.)</p>
                    <p>In the weeks since my return to Washington, I have found similar views here
                        at the working levels of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on
                        the conduciveness of the present climate to such initiatives.</p>
                    <p>Now, to my great interest, we have fresh support for such moves, not only
                        from the Zablocki Subcommittee, but also in part from the U.S. Chamber of
                        Commerce in its 1965 Annual Meeting (it urged us to “open channels of
                        communication with the people of Mainland China”). In addition, I have just
                        talked to our Taipei <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, who assures me
                        that the necessary advance consultations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on both of these matters would go far more easily in the
                        present climate and would be successful.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that our Asian posture is tougher than ever before, that
                        the Congress has given us a gentle boost, that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is judged to be persuadable, and that we face no election
                        this autumn, I would strongly urge that we get moving on both these items at
                        long last.</p>

                            very important annex on Chinese Communist policy toward Vietnam, but
                            they did not make it wholly clear that this account was part of a direct

                            that I think you will want to read it yourself in the British telegrams

                                The former summarized a meeting with Foreign Minister Ch'en Yi,
                                largely about Vietnam, in which he asked the British to deliver the

                        <item>Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s first impression is
                            that this is a relatively defensive message.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Telegram 720 stated that Ch'en said <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> had asked Pakistan President Ayub Khan,
                                when he visited Peking in March, to give a message to the U.S.
                                Government, but since Ayub's visit to the United States had been
                                postponed, the message might not have been delivered. Ch'en
                                therefore asked if the British would pass on the message. The
                                message reads as follows: “(I) China will not provoke war with
                                United States; (II) what China says counts; (III) China is prepared;
                                and (IV) if United States bombs China that wd mean war and there wd
                                be no limits to the war.”</note> My own feeling is more mixed. The
                            basic trouble with the message is that it does not tell us at all at
                            what point the Chinese might move in Vietnam itself in a way which would
                            force us to act against China. And that of course is the $64
                            question.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>The time appears to be at hand to broaden somewhat the categories of
                        Americans entitled to travel to Communist China. I believe we should <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0209"/>broaden the categories to include
                        scholars and graduate students with a legitimate professional requirement to
                        visit the area.</p>
                    <p>We have an unusual opportunity here to put the Chinese Communists on the
                        defensive and to nullify domestic criticism of both the right and the left.
                        Given our stand in Viet-Nam, our critics on the right can hardly accuse us
                        of going soft on Communist China. Since the Chinese Communists will probably
                        not permit any increase in travel at this time, we can demonstrate that we
                        are acting out of boldness, not timidity, and that it is the Chinese
                        Communists rather than ourselves who fear the exchange of ideas. On the
                        other hand, there are few gestures which would better serve both to further
                        our own policy interests and to reassure the academic community that we are
                        interested in the flow of information to and from Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Even if the Chinese in the future should allow some scholars to enter China,
                        we do not believe there is a significant chance of adverse incidents or
                        ill-treatment of these Americans. We would continue to warn of the inability
                        of the government to provide protection, and to make clear that we are
                        removing restrictions on, rather than promoting, such travel.</p>
                    <p>Further, a relaxation of certain travel restrictions will show that the
                        Department is exercising the authority, upheld in the Zemel case, in a
                        reasonable and responsible manner.</p>
                    <p>We have had recommendations for increased efforts at contact from various
                        quarters, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Zablocki
                        subcommittee. You may recall that the proposal to authorize scholars' travel
                        to Communist China was made formally to us by the Joint Committee on
                        Contemporary China and was seriously considered in 1962, but was laid aside
                        in favor of the decision to press for a more general relaxation of our
                        travel rules. A proposal for a general relaxation was made to the White
                        House in January 1963, but was not acted upon at that time. We do not
                        believe that the present situation justifies the resurrection of the more
                        general proposal, but to act now on scholars has many advantages, among
                        which is the circumstance that the scholarly community has been largely
                        mollified by the awareness that we were sympathetically considering their
                        interest in a revision of the rules, but this situation cannot be
                        indefinitely extended if we do not take action.</p>
                    <p>If after such consultation with the White House as you deem appropriate you
                        decide to authorize such a broadening, it might be worthwhile at the same
                        time to consider whether the President might take advantage of this move,
                        and make the idea of “improved communication" one of the themes for his
                        forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commemorative speech in San
                        Francisco. If authorized, <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SCA1">SCA</gloss> and L will draw up and issue appropriate
                        Department regulations and notification of the change. In addition, in
                        announcing the change, we might note the existence of the “national
                        interest" category, which we now use, and <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0210"/>explain the terms whereby persons might be eligible to
                        travel in Communist China on the grounds that such travel would be in the
                        national interest. I would propose to cite representatives of bona fide
                        humanitarian, cultural and educational organizations as potential examples
                        of persons entitled to be considered under “national interest"

                                specialists to travel to Communist China is irrelevant and
                                inadequate. It is irrelevant because we have had only two requests
                                in the past several years for validated passports from such types
                                (from Paul Dudley White and the famous ear specialist). In both

                                because it fails to meet our basic 2-fold need on this subject: to
                                shift the onus to the Chinese dramatically, and once and for all,
                                for obstinacy, rigidity and self-isolation; and to be responsive to
                                persistent pressure from bona fide American scholars who for years
                                have patiently accepted State's assurance that the travel ban will
                                be shortly lifted. (These scholars have been very cooperative, but

                                preview of this mouse makes no sense. The Chinese reaction is
                                utterly predictable (they will reject the idea as a pure propaganda
                                ploy). Furthermore, State's request for Presidential decision on
                                this matter today creates a false sense of urgency on a subject
                                whose full dimensions should receive unhurried Presidential
                                consideration.</item>

                        specialists all favor a considerably broader lifting of the travel ban for
                        scholars, scientists and journalists to Red China and Albania. In my view,
                        it would be far better procedure to defer any Presidential action on the
                        present proposal until State can present the President with the full travel
                        picture, including alternatives which the 7th floor has rejected.</p>

                        relatively routine except for occasional outbursts of tough and <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0212"/>intemperate language from
                            <persName>Wang</persName>. Next meeting is scheduled for September 15.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> opened with condemnation U.S. “occupation"
                        Taiwan. He claimed U.S. using Taiwan as “ever-floating aircraft carrier"
                        from which to attack mainland, that U.S. plotting create two Chinas, that
                        U.S. crimes of aggression against Taiwan beyond description. He said Taiwan
                        inalienable part of Chinese territory. Chinese people will strive to end to
                        liberate Taiwan. Claimed U.S., while expanding war in Indo-China, also
                        intensifying efforts make military provocations against China in Taiwan
                        Straits area and that U.S. trying draft Chiang gang into war by ordering
                        them place airfields at U.S. disposal etc. Cited serious warnings 378 to
                        387.</p>
                    <p>Wang said he instructed lodge strong protest April 24 presidential executive
                        order which included Paracel Islands in combat waters.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> said Paracels are Chinese. U.S. Govt must be
                        held responsible for all grave consequences arising therefrom.</p>
                    <p>Second part <persName>Wang</persName>'s opener devoted to U.S. actions
                        Viet-nam. <persName>Wang</persName> stated U.S. openly declaring war on
                        Vietnamese people and embarking on fighting major war. He repeated standard
                        line on 17th parallel and that all Vietnamese people including those in
                        North have right hit back at U.S. aggressors. Since U.S. has sent own and
                        lackey's troops Chinese have secure right to do all in their power to hit
                        back at U.S. aggressors. U.S. attempting cover up crimes by playing peace
                        hoax. All peace talks doomed to failure. U.S. should never be able to get by
                        political deception what U.S. cannot get on battlefield.</p>
                    <p>I responded by strongly refuting <persName>Wang</persName>'s argument on U.S.
                        aggression against Taiwan. Also denied ChiCom claim to Paracel Islands.
                        Followed with text Department's instruction. <persName>Wang</persName>
                        retorted with at times intemperate but familiar attack on U.S. position
                        claiming U.S. on one hand pursuing war and on other giving lip service to
                        peace. He said empty words alone cannot alter atmosphere between our two
                        countries. <persName>Wang</persName> claimed U.S. instead of ending
                        aggressive acts was redoubling aggression. Claimed every time U.S. said
                        prayer for peace we add fagot to fire of aggression.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> said U.S. suffering one defeat after another in
                        war of aggression, hence desire to talk about peaceful settlement. Peace
                        talk plot a vicious one but it impossible pull wool over eyes of people of
                        world. <persName>Wang</persName> gave standard ChiCom position on Indian
                        proposal, 17-nation appeal, and Wilson mission (but for once in more
                        temperate language). Repeated line only way settle Viet-nam problem is for
                        U.S. Govt to stop war of aggression against South Viet-nam, withdraw all
                        U.S. lackey forces from South Viet-nam, stop acts of war against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, implement Geneva Agreements of 1954 and
                        let Vietnamese people settle own affairs. Claimed Front, as true
                        representative South Vietnamese people, <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0213"/>must have decisive voice. Referring to Front's March 22
                        statement as only way settle problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> then became impassioned and, after saying U.S.
                        hands stained with blood South Vietnamese people, he departed from text and
                        referred to our comments that Chinese youth should be steeled in war.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> said “We should deal with your unjust war with
                        a just war. You are not only committing aggression against Viet-nam but are
                        also posing threat to China every day.” He then quickly shifted subject to
                        repetition U.S. aggression against Taiwan. <persName>Wang</persName> said as
                        long as U.S. refuses to give up policy of aggression we will continue have
                        struggle. If this root cause not removed, no way to settle problem. If U.S.
                        has sincere desire for peace, U.S. must immediately withdraw forces and stop
                        aggression. Otherwise, all other talks of peace are useless and nothing but
                        a swindle.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName>Wang</persName> his side had rejected numerous efforts
                        towards peaceful discussions but had offered no suggestions in return.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> made weak retort that Hanoi's four points and
                        Front's March 22 position constituted only basis for settlement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> then discussed standard line on atomic explosion.
                        Accused U.S. of crime in using atomic bombs against Japan.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> repeated at length ChiCom claim to Paracels;
                        gave standard line on Cambodia and Laos conferences (smoke screen to fool
                        peoples of world). <persName>Wang</persName> also recited usual line on U.S.
                        interference in Dominican Republic, Congo, and referred to comments in U.S.
                        press (including Senators Morse and Gruening) critical of U.S. actions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> toward end of meeting stated, “Should you impose
                        war on Chinese people we will fight back. We are not warlike. This is
                        shameless slander. If others wish to impose war on Chinese people we are not
                        afraid to fight a war. We shall resolutely strike back to end. Should anyone
                        dare to extend his tentacles to China we will cut them off.” At another
                        point <persName>Wang</persName> said, “we will not watch U.S. riding
                        roughshod in world, particularly in neighboring countries, without doing
                        anything on our part.”</p>
                    <p>Meeting lasted 2 hours 35 minutes.</p>

                        <item>The Secretary commented that the study appeared not to have taken into
                            account sufficiently the total capability of the other side to react in
                            other areas to a crisis in Southeast Asia. He cited Berlin as an
                            example. In the event of Soviet pressure in Berlin he foresaw a possible
                            worldwide adverse reaction, but particularly on the part of our European
                            allies, on the grounds that the U.S. had precipitated the European
                            crisis. It was pointed out that the consensus in the intelligence
                            community was that the Soviets preferred to handle one crisis at a time
                            in view of the escalatory potential of concurrent widely spaced crises.

                            thought the Soviets would have available a wide range of opportunities
                            to retaliate against the U.S. in Southeast Asia, e.g. against U.S. naval
                            forces, without the same degree of danger that a direct confrontation
                            with the U.S. in Europe would inevitably involve. The Secretary
                            responded that there is considerable latitude with respect to Berlin
                            within which the Soviets could bring pressure before the problem got out
                            of hand.</item>

                        <item>The Secretary indicated his agreement with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that the study tends to
                            underestimate the forces which might impel the Soviets to earlier and
                            more extensive participation in a Southeast Asian crisis. He asked what
                            the reactions of our Ambassadors were to this question, especially that

                        <item>In connection with Far Eastern attitudes, Mr.
                                <persName>Kitchen</persName> cited the view of Ambassador Reischauer
                            that even a prolonged conventional war in Southeast Asia is likely to
                            have an adverse effect on U.S. objectives in Japan. Mr.
                                <persName>Weiss</persName> added that some of our overseas
                            representatives feel that the Japanese are totally out of sympathy with
                            U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. They reason from their own experience in
                            attempting to conquer China that it is a losing proposition. Moreover,
                            the Japanese, as do other Asians, doubt the ability of the Chinese to
                            extend their sovereignty over all of Southeast Asia. They believe the
                            area is too vast and the indigenous populations too hostile to permit
                            this. Thus the Japanese dislike seeing a deepening U.S. involvement. The
                            Secretary responded that it is misleading for the Japanese to argue that
                            their experience was so unsuccessful. At least until Japan made the
                            mistake of attacking the U.S. it was not doing too badly in Asia.</item>

                        <item>Turning to the matter of the longer-range ChiCom study, the Secretary
                            stated that the Study Group should work on alternative hypotheses. This
                            would recognize that some changes are inevitable, e.g., changes in
                            present ChiCom leadership. What happens if China continues to be
                            militant? How do we proceed? On the other hand, what happens if China
                            moves toward peaceful co-existence? Are there other alternatives? In
                            essence, the Secretary believes we should not tie a review of policy to
                            one assumption. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> agreed and commented that we should not
                            overlook the influence of changes in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Secretary went on to cite other variables that
                            need consideration, including the effect of population growth; the
                            ability to arm and feed an increased population; the effect on Chinese
                            policy if attitudes hardened against them, e.g., in Africa or somewhere
                            else; the impingement of Chinese and Japanese policy; and the effect of
                            Sukarno passing from the scene. In concluding these comments, the
                            Secretary asked that he be furnished recent intelligence studies of
                            worldwide Communist party reactions to the <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0216"/>Sino-Soviet split. Finally, the Secretary suggested
                            that the long-range study be checked out with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName>Yager</persName> indicated that he had already been in

                    <p>A personal disappointment in leaving <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> after
                        almost two years has been our inability over that period of time to
                        strengthen and modernize our China policy by lifting restrictions on travel
                        of Americans to Communist China and by taking certain other measures such as
                        easing the administrative application of <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>
                        controls and recognizing Mongolia. We were unable even to include in our
                        last Warsaw instruction the limited suggestion of informing the Chinese
                        representative that we would be authorizing travel of American medical and
                        public health officials to mainland China. This was a small step in the
                        right direction, although it fell far short of what I hoped would be our
                        position by 1965.</p>
                    <p>Attached is a talking paper which <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Lindsey
                            Grant</persName> and I prepared almost two years ago providing the
                        argumentation on liberalization of travel regulations governing American
                            citizens.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">Not attached to the source
                            text.</note> Those arguments are just as valid today although I
                        appreciate that the intensified war in Viet-Nam <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0217"/>might make it difficult to liberalize travel to North
                        Viet-Nam and possibly to North Korea. But why not Communist China?</p>
                    <p>Over the past four years, both in Hong Kong and in Washington, I have spoken
                        to many members of Congress and the press and have given hundreds of
                        speeches and briefings. Oftentimes the subject of taking new initiatives on
                        travel and recognition of Outer Mongolia has arisen and I have not heard one
                        voice raised in dissent when this issue has been discussed. On the contrary,
                        I feel that the overwhelming opinion amongst our countrymen is in favor of
                        doing that which broadly advertises our freedom and our confidence and of
                        dramatizing Peiping's self-isolation. Clearly the liberalization of our
                        policies, taken at the very moment we are showing toughness in Viet-Nam,
                        would not be misunderstood. It would be widely applauded in the U.S. and
                        elsewhere. And it would do much to cope with criticisms in our scholarly
                        community of US policies in Asia.</p>
                    <p>I feel that this is a real opportunity for the <persName>Johnson</persName>

                        <item>You may find it useful, as a means of orienting the discussion, to
                            establish at the outset the purpose for convening the meeting. In this
                            connection, I see the following objectives:</item>

                        <hi rend="italic">A. A Discussion of the “Critical Policy Problems.”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It appears to me that these issues are intrinsically of great significance
                        and to the extent that they are deemed valid, it would be extremely useful
                        to have both an understanding of their nature and a consensus about their
                        significance at the top levels of the government. My own impression, I am
                        bound to make clear, is that both field comments and the study itself seem
                        to suggest that further escalation of our military operations against the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (as opposed to prosecuting the war
                        in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>) would not have the result of
                        winning the war in which we are presently engaged but would seriously risk
                        changing the character of the war, possibly to the point where the costs are
                        out of proportion to the gains. By and large, it seems to me that the
                        comments on the study which we have received from key U.S. Missions abroad
                        have indicated a preference for the thesis that “the war must be won in the
                        South.” Obviously, this issue has been through the crucible of debate many
                        times but perhaps not with the advantage of the “look down the road" which
                        is furnished by the Study Group's report.</p>

                            <p>The short range study laid no claims to being a definitive analysis
                                of the problem, nor does it purport to represent a plan of action
                                for the future. We are, of course, committed to undertake a longer
                                range study, in which State will take a leading role, of US-Chinese
                                relations looking through 1975. You may wish to solicit views as to

                            <p>It was my feeling in initiating the China Study that pressures
                                inevitably force too much of a concentration on very immediate
                                objectives and courses of action without permitting the full
                                recognition of longer range implications and without necessarily
                                permitting a relating of individual actions to a comprehensive,
                                long-range politico-military concept. A rather provocative, but
                                trenchant, observation made in the Report epitomizes the concern I

                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to Soviet interests in Southeast Asia, it has been pointed
                            out that the Chinese did not invent nor have they been in the past the
                            principal supporters of the doctrine of national liberation. The Soviets
                            are equally committed to the concept of wars of national liberation.</p>
                        <p>The study however appears to underestimate the degree of Soviet
                            involvement and of Soviet reaction to U.S. actions, particularly in the
                            stage where U.S. military operations are confined to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and consequently overestimates the
                            possibility of reaching a tacit understanding between the U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to avoid a major conflict as
                            each side seeks to defend its own interests. Because of the public
                            commitment which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has made to
                            defend the interests of North Viet Nam, escalation or even continuation
                            of our attacks on North Viet Nam will make it increasingly difficult to
                            maintain any serious dialogue with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for the purpose of trying to influence it to moderate
                            its support of that regime. Moreover, the type of assistance which
                            Moscow has already supplied Hanoi could lead to a confrontation with the
                            United States. As the amount of equipment increases, the possibility of
                            mutual miscalculation or accident also increases.</p>
                        <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0220"/>
                        <p>In general, the assumption that Soviet involvement would be minimal has
                            the effect of making the military equation less difficult for the U.S.
                            If a major Soviet involvement of materiel and perhaps of volunteers was
                            in prospect, the effect this would have on the size, nature and
                            consequences of the U.S. commitment, is a matter not explored by the
                            study.</p>
                        <p>With respect to U.S. actions against Communist China, the study does say
                            that “in the event of U.S. attacks against South China, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably feel compelled to
                            provide the ChiComs, after some period of delay, with military
                            equipment, e.g., advanced fighters and missiles.” “Soviet first line
                            aircraft and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s might have a critical
                            effect on control of the air over the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and China.” A threat to the existence of a Communist
                            regime in Peiping would probably force the Soviets to become involved
                            militarily to a highly dangerous degree: “An objective that includes the
                            destruction of the Communist regime in China would be most costly and
                            would carry grave risks of general war with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” This would illustrate a situation in which military
                            activities would have far out-run fundamental U.S. national security
                            interests.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>While the Chinese are utterly opposed to the U.S. presence in Southeast
                            Asia, they expect to use subversion and infiltration of supplies to
                            achieve their objectives, and not direct military force unless their own
                            immediate lines of defense are threatened. The study does not indicate
                            what, if any, level and intensification of U.S. military operations in
                            North Viet Nam will bring the Chinese into the war but it does indicate
                            that at some point Chinese interests and prestige will become
                            increasingly committed to some sort of participation. It has been
                            suggested that the Communist Chinese might become actively involved in
                            the war if the Communist regime in North Viet Nam were threatened, if
                            Chinese borders were placed in jeopardy, or if large Chinese Nationalist
                            forces were brought to the Southeast Asia mainland.</p>
                        <p>One form of Chinese intervention, well prior to any land action, might be
                            the commitment of fighters from Chinese bases to the air defense of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The Study suggests that the
                            U.S. would be at a serious disadvantage if it failed to neutralize bases
                            from which the Chinese fighters were employed. It is hard to believe
                            that such an attack on China could result in anything other than the
                            signal for war with that country. Indeed, a special <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> recently completed estimates that if
                            the Chinese actually commit their aircraft to defend the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> from Chinese bases they must be assumed
                            to be prepared to fight a major conflict with the U.S. Already we have
                            reports that the Chinese are evacuating various executive offices and
                            factories from certain cities and are also installing large numbers of
                                <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> units in key areas apparently in
                            anticipation of an escalation of conflict to the Chinese mainland.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The study suggests that military requirements for nuclear weapons will be
                            especially acute in two circumstances: (1) if the ChiComs/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> launched a massive invasion of
                            Southeast Asia before U.S. forces were deployed there in large numbers;
                            (“It is quite likely that the U.S. would be faced with the decision to
                            use nuclear weapons … perhaps the second or third day of the invasion.”)
                            (2) if the U.S. were to bombard Communist Chinese military or industrial
                            facilities on any military significant scale; (“The comparable effects
                            of a conventional attack are very much less because the time required to
                            achieve the same level of destruction is very much longer, thus,
                            permitting repair of damage …”). There is an inference in the study that
                            planners are also counting heavily on the psychological effects of
                            nuclear weapons to break the ChiCom will to resist. However, the report
                            emphasizes that the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S. would produce an
                            “overwhelmingly adverse reaction from U.S. allies as well as the
                            Communist world and the uncommitted powers" and that “lasting resentment
                            against the U.S. might be generated.” It is suggested that U.S. use of
                            nuclear weapons might mean the loss of key military bases in the Far
                            East, the disassociation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries from U.S. actions in Asia, and the reduction or termination of
                            the U.S. presence in many parts of the non-aligned world.</p>
                        <p>While it seems highly improbable that the Soviets would turn over nuclear
                            weapons to the Chinese, and at least in the relatively short run the
                            Chinese will not have an inventory of their own, it is not quite so
                            inconceivable that the Soviets might support the Chinese with their own
                            nuclear arsenal by some expedient method. Though this would obviously be
                            very dangerous for the Soviets, they might feel forced to it, and might
                            even devise techniques which were sufficiently ambiguous, such as
                            provision of Soviet volunteers with nuclear capability, which the
                            Soviets might calculate would avoid a direct confrontation with the U.S.
                            In any event, if the enemy did have nuclear weapons for use in the
                            theater, for example, against U.S. and allied bases and forces, is it
                            entirely clear that introduction of nuclear weapons would even be
                            militarily advantageous to the U.S.?</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The study lays considerable stress on the upward pressure on U.S.
                            objectives which would result from a major military confrontation with
                            Communist China (e.g., “initial U.S. objectives … would appear wholly
                            inadequate to the large-scale hostilities going on and some adjustment
                            would have to be made.”) One objective which is frequently mentioned is
                            the reunification of Viet Nam. Others mentioned are the destruction of
                            ChiCom nuclear facilities, the ChiCom industrial base, and even the
                            elimination of the Communist regime in Peiping. “But enlarged objectives
                            also mean enlarged costs, and perhaps a war in Asia which might be <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0222"/>decisive only when large-scale
                            strategic nuclear attacks against China were carried out.” Since
                            military domination of China by the U.S. seems impractical in military
                            terms, would almost assuredly involve war with the Soviet Union, and
                            seems otherwise to present enormous problems for the U.S., consideration
                            should be given to such questions as how readily we should be prepared
                            to expand political objectives, how insistent we should be on
                            maintaining limited objectives in the face of major hostilities, and
                            whether, in fact, we should not insure that military operations do not
                            create an undesired upward pressure on national objectives.</p>

                            direction of Lt. General Spivy, newly appointed head of J–5. The study
                            is largely focused on the military implications of a rising crescendo of
                            hostilities with the Red Chinese, the scenarios in some cases being

                            implications.</p>
                        <p>The study assumes that the broad political objective of the US in the Far
                            East is to seek the containment of Communist China, working over the
                            longer run and as occasion permits for a softening of the present
                            militant approach of the Chinese Communist leadership. Within this broad
                            framework, the group examined the more immediate and specific political
                            objectives which the US might wish to pursue, assuming that under
                            alternative potential contingency situations the US could find itself
                            faced with the possibility of a military confrontation with Communist
                            China. The study was to examine these political objectives in relation
                            to existing and projected military plans and capabilities. Points of
                            particular concern were to be how to discourage Soviet support for the
                            ChiComs in event of hostilities; how to keep the level of hostilities as
                            low as possible consistent with attainment of objectives; the proper
                            role for our nuclear capability; and what political and military
                            adjustments were indicated by the study.</p>
                        <p>Essentially the study moves through five basic military situations,
                            starting from the position in which we found ourselves in Southeast Asia
                            in March 1965, through a major nuclear war with the Chinese.</p>

                            <item>In Situation A, US air attacks (2500 sorties) on military targets
                                well removed from urban industrial areas have not produced the
                                results we desire. A number of military installations have been
                                destroyed or damaged; about 20% of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s ammunition storage capacity has been destroyed;
                                and the movement of supplies south of the 20th parallel has been
                                restricted. Despite this limited impact, the bombings have had a
                                cohesive effect on the populace of North Vietnam and there has been
                                no significant reduction in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                                supply and support of the continuing Vietnam operations. Therefore,
                                the US elects to increase the scale and scope of bombing within
                                North Vietnam, to include peripheral industrial targets, such as
                                selected electric power plants.</item>
                            <item>Situation B represents one step up the ladder of escalation. At
                                this point, a total of 4500 sorties have been flown by US/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> forces which include the increase
                                in scale and scope as a result of Situation A. However, the Viet
                                Cong have intensified their activity and expanded their control
                                despite the increased bombing; ChiCom volunteers are now operating
                                in North Vietnam with limited numbers of aircraft (50–70) and
                                surface to air missiles; and Soviet missile technicians have manned
                                the SA–2 <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> installation in the
                                vicinity of Hanoi. The US response is to increase the level of
                                bombing again, including more general attack of industrial targets
                                and all categories of transportation, but excluding Hanoi; deploy to
                                South Vietnam the remainder of the Marine division which has
                                elements already there, one Army Division, and one Free World
                                Division (presumed to be <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>); and
                                develop plans and prepare to blockade North Vietnam.</item>
                            <item>In Situation C, the US response described in Situation B has
                                checked deterioration of the military and political situation in
                                South Vietnam and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> gives some
                                indications of wavering. At this point, ChiCom aircraft operating
                                from bases in Hainan and South China engage the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aircraft which are bombing North
                                Vietnam, and large numbers of ChiCom ground forces are deployed in
                                North Vietnam. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                                continued to send “volunteer" units to set up and man missile sites.
                                It has announced also the forming of a “volunteer" division which it
                                implies will be sent to North Vietnam if the US does not halt
                                aggression and agree to negotiations.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The postulated US response in Situation C is to: increase military
                            activity against the Viet Cong; include targets in Hanoi in air attacks;
                            bomb ChiCom air and naval bases on Hainan Island and in South China, as
                            well as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> ports; and mine ports of
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, in South China, and on Hainan.
                            Additional naval units are introduced into the South China Sea and two
                            Army divisions are deployed to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>The marked improvement in South Vietnam assumed to have been produced by
                            the measures taken by the US in Situation C, causes Communist China and
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in Situation D to launch a major
                            attack at the <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0224"/>beginning of the
                            dry season. This involves operations by 22 divisions in South Vietnam,
                            Laos and Thailand. Rather than postulating a US response in this
                            situation, the study examined the political and military implications of
                            a variety of courses of action.</p>
                        <p>The final situation (Alternative Situation A) departs from the forced
                            escalation of Situation A through D by assuming ChiCom/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> initiation of large scale ground attack
                            prior to the significant build-up of friendly forces which is assumed
                            had been achieved in Situation D as by-product of progressive
                            escalation. Thus the situation when the attack commences is assumed to
                            be that at the outset of the study, i.e., Situation A. The treatment in
                            Alternative Situation A generally parallels that in Situation D: an
                            examination of the political and military implications of a variety of
                            courses of action.</p>
                        <p>Both Situation D and Alternative Situation A include assessment of the
                            impact of nuclear weapons on ground and air operations. Some interesting
                            comparisons of nuclear and non-nuclear force requirements for the same
                            operations appear in summary charts opposite pp IV–60 and IV–80.<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">Not printed.</note>

                        <persName>Chiang</persName>'s aim was to use <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>, whom he trusts, in order to communicate a “message"
                        directly to you. (<persName>Chiang</persName> feels that more normal
                        “diplomatic channels" have distorted and disregarded his views in recent
                        years.)</p>
                    <p>The Gimo's message, in brief: The Chinese Communists and their Vietnamese
                        allies are about to engage the U.S. in a long ground war of attrition which
                        we cannot hope to win; <persName>Chiang</persName> stands ready to provide
                        troops to Vietnam if we want them; but most important, he urges that now is
                        the time for an amphibious Chinese Nationalist landing on the South China
                        (Kwangtung) coast in order to cut Peking's supply lines to Vietnam and to
                        begin the reconquest of the mainland. The Gimo believes that it is now or
                        never; the Sino/Soviet dispute assures that the U.S.S.R. will not intervene,
                        and the Chinese Communists have not yet achieved a sufficient nuclear
                        buildup to deter a Nationalist invasion.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of our views on such undertakings, the Gimo asks that we do some
                        coordinated strategic planning for such a move. He intends to spell out his
                        proposals more fully in a letter to you that will be carried by his son
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Ching-kuo</persName>, the Defense Minister, when
                        he comes to Washington in late September.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Ray Cline</persName> comments that the Gimo was
                        more emotional than the situation warrants and probably fears that his
                        control of Taiwan will weaken unless he appears to be doing something active
                        about fighting the Chinese Communists. Hence the revival of the
                        “counter-attack" theme. In balance, Cline's visit seems to have provided a
                        boost to the Gimo's ego—and a healthy escape-valve for his pent-up feelings
                        that the U.S. had written him off.</p>

                        <item>The dedicated, narrowly doctrinaire men who rule China initially
                            gained the support of the Chinese people by swiftly unifying a country
                            in chaos. But their adventurist “Great Leap Forward" program failed
                            disastrously, substantially reducing popular faith in the leadership and
                            popular support of its programs. Despite their failures, the dwindling
                            group of elderly leaders remain determined to carry through political
                            and social programs that will produce a modernized China, and a “new
                            Communist man.”</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>This policy is the work of a remarkably small and stable group of men.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and his lieutenants
                            have, over the past three decades, avoided major internal schisms and
                            refused to admit younger blood into their ranks. In recent years the
                            leadership has turned inward upon itself; it has virtually dispensed
                            with formal party meetings and congresses while cloaking its operations
                            in ever greater secrecy.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The party can exact obedience and compliance, but, despite its
                            recurrent campaigns, the people attempt to improve their material lot
                            and to avoid politics. These attitudes have widely infected the lower
                            levels of the party apparatus as well. The regime is currently engaged
                            in massive campaigns to “reform" or weed out errant party cadres and to
                            “educate" the people to accept the regime's collectivist programs. It
                            has announced that it will launch another production upsurge, but this
                            is likely to differ significantly from the ill-fated Great Leap Forward.
                            The outlook is for increased tensions.</item>

                            continue along present doctrinaire lines. His successors will not have

                            and this may in time open the door to the growth of factionalism inside
                            the party.</item>

                            succeeded in their turn by a generation of party veterans, now in their
                            50's. Although these men give no evidence of a broader, more moderate
                            viewpoint, they will have to deal with a host of accumulated pressures
                            and may perforce be more flexible and pragmatic. At least for the next
                            several years, however, political and social problems within China are
                            unlikely to prevent economic and military development or to force a
                            softening of Chinese foreign policy.</item>

                    <p>Article VII of the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the
                        Republic of China, which entered into force on March 3, 1955, provides for
                        the stationing of United States forces in and about Taiwan “as determined by
                        mutual agreement.” Discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        concerning a status of forces agreement were begun in 1955 but were
                        interrupted by the Taipei riot of 1957 and the Straits crisis of 1958. In
                        1959 authority to negotiate an agreement was granted by the Acting Secretary
                        to the Ambassador to China, with the understanding that authority to sign
                        the agreement would be sought when negotiations were concluded (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">The tabs are attached but not printed.</note> On
                        July 30, 1965 the United States and the Republic of China jointly announced
                        the conclusion of negotiations.</p>

                    <p>Attached (Tab B) is the English text of the agreement which will be the basis
                        for final agreement.</p>
                    <p>The twenty article agreement is modeled on the basic <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> status of forces formula, tailored to fit the particular
                        situation in Taiwan. It provides that the United States will bear the cost
                        of the maintenance of its forces, while the Republic of China will furnish
                        facilities and areas and rights of way. The United States is to receive
                        utilities and services at rates and under conditions which are no less
                        favorable than those of any governmental agency of the Republic of China.
                        United States personnel are to enjoy freedom of entry and exit, exemption
                        from local taxes, and exemption from customs duties provided that personal
                        items are brought into the agreement area (Taiwan and the Pescadores) within
                        six months of the person's initial arrival, or are purchased or obtained
                        thereafter through a United States operated exchange, commissary, or
                        military post office, or under certain other specified conditions.</p>
                    <p>The jurisdiction article is patterned after the Supplementary Agreement
                        between the United States and Germany. In the minutes to be published with
                        the agreement the Republic of China agrees to waive its primary jurisdiction
                        but reserves the right to recall such waiver in specific cases where major
                        interests of Chinese administration of justice make the exercise of Chinese
                        jurisdiction imperative, particularly in cases of security offenses against
                        the Republic of China, offenses causing the death of a human being, robbery
                        and rape.</p>
                    <p>In a separate exchange of letters, the cases in which the Chinese Government
                        could recall its waiver are limited solely to the following: security
                        offenses against the Republic of China, offenses causing the death of a
                        human being, narcotics offenses, robbery, rape and arson. By limiting
                        Chinese jurisdiction to these offenses, the United States personnel are
                        protected against the operation of the Special Laws (tantamount to martial
                        law) presently in effect in Taiwan. It is also provided that United States
                        personnel will not be tried in Chinese military courts.</p>
                    <p>The jurisdiction article provides further that the United States shall have
                        the right to custody of an accused person until the completion of all
                        judicial proceedings. The Chinese have agreed to comprehensive trial
                        safeguards and to the conclusiveness of United States duty certifications in
                        determining primary jurisdiction. Under the agreed minutes the adequacy of
                        Chinese confinement facilities will be a matter of joint agreement between
                        United States and Chinese authorities. A Joint Committee is to be formed by
                        the two governments to assist in implementing the agreement.</p>
                    <p>The claims article provides for unilateral settlement of claims by the United
                        States, with the Chinese having the option to turn to the standard <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> claims formula should they find United
                        States unilateral settlement procedures unsatisfactory.</p>

                            bet that 80% of those interested in the problem think that the reason
                            more Americans cannot go to Red China is U.S. intransigence—while the
                            fact is that it is mainly the Red Chinese themselves who have prevented
                            such travel.</item>

                        <item>Under our own current policy guidelines, I know of no way we can use
                            Dr. <persName>White</persName> at this time. If we were to give official
                            backing to a White visit to China, it is predictable that the Red
                            Chinese would turn it down. This would not gain us much.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>On the other hand, the White case does raise the question whether we
                            are smart to let it appear that we are the people who block
                            communication between our two countries. Our Chinese experts have
                            recommended for some time that we should ease our present travel
                            restrictions and make a general rule that doctors and public health
                            specialists—or perhaps all workers in the fields of health, education,
                            and welfare—would be authorized to receive visas. (Our present rule
                            includes (1) authorized news correspondents, (2) families of the four
                            imprisoned Americans, and (3) individual cases in which the national
                            interest is served—Dr. <persName>White</persName>'s visit would have
                            come under this third category.)</item>

                        <item>We discussed this matter at a Tuesday luncheon earlier this winter

                            be wise to change our current policy. But perhaps if we were to change
                            it in response to an appeal by Paul Dudley White—and at a time when our
                            policy in Vietnam has reached a new level of clarity and firmness—we
                            might make a useful stroke in all directions. I will put this matter on

                        <item>The Secretary opened the meeting by commenting that the study was a
                            very useful piece of work. He stated, however, that there are certain
                            aspects which require further thinking through. In this connection, he
                            mentioned to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
                            that the Soviet position requires further thought. It is possible the
                            Soviets may not prefer to see a settlement in Southeast Asia. The
                            struggle with Peiping is very deep-rooted and as a result may force the
                            Soviets to take a stronger position than might otherwise be the case. He
                            said he questions whether the Soviets would be willing to suffer another
                            missile crisis setback considering the very major effects this could
                            have upon the Soviet world position. Putting himself in their shoes,
                            were he a Soviet leader he would be inclined to be sure that the US was
                            presented with threats elsewhere in the world but tied to Southeast
                            Asia, for example, by renewed pressure on Berlin. Such action, the
                            Secretary believed, would raise very difficult alliance problems. The US
                            would be blamed. The Secretary said he would be pleased to be proven
                            wrong, but be doubted it. He thinks the study may have been too
                            optimistic concerning Soviet policy, though we would do everything
                            possible on the diplomatic side to avoid a confrontation with the
                            Soviets. Nevertheless, the longer the hostilities continue, the bigger
                            the problem with the Soviets will become.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary went on to say that the second major problem that
                            bothered him was the time factor. He pointed out that the US is
                            concerned <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0232"/>with the need “for
                            something to support in Vietnam.” The US effort would be very difficult
                            in Southeast Asia if the political position in Vietnam erodes. However,
                            the same might well be applied to the other side. There would be a great
                            advantage to an all-out effort in South Vietnam, perhaps in September,
                            if this could bring the other side to the conclusion that there was too
                            little left for it to support in South Vietnam; too little from which to
                            construct a viable political position. With a basis in military success,
                            a concurrent peace offensive would give us a possibility of effective
                            action before the other side makes the major decision to ask for more
                            support.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Thirdly, the Secretary said that the problems of the use of nuclear
                            weapons was perhaps understated in the paper. He noted that the use of
                            nukes is not a line of action which we are going to abandon. He pointed
                            out that the US has been careful not to foreclose this possibility,
                            particularly in the Pacific against China. However, this problem may
                            affect our whole position in the world and could even be influenced by
                            domestic attitudes. The gravity and difficulty of the decision should be
                            recognized.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Finally, the Secretary said he was pleased to see that a State-<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> group had been set up to take a longer,
                            more careful look at the problem and that this should be helpful.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
                            his understanding was that the study was directed at the longer range
                            problem and in this connection he would hope to have more analyses of
                            the way the Communist Chinese are likely to move in their foreign
                            policy, especially in Asia. From this we would be able to derive how the
                            US should move in response. He cited India and Japan as two key areas.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> commented in response
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that the Senior
                            Policy Group (<persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>) had decided that such a look was not practical
                            in the initial short-range effort, but quite agreed that the longer
                            range study should encompass such considerations.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            question, General Spivy said the longer-range study was due for
                            completion next June, but with internal wrap-ups on various actions from
                            time to time. He commented that the study is not a planning document per
                            se, but an independent look at the problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked if an outline of the
                            longer-range study could not be developed. General Spivy indicated that
                            an initial outline is available (and passed out copies)<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">Not found, but see <ref target="#d161">Document
                                    161</ref>.</note> noting that the outline is still being
                            revamped. Mr. <persName>Yager</persName> said that the outline is
                            considered as a checklist of points to be covered at this stage.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary stated that some of the matters covered in the outline
                            are already operational and others may become so even before next <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0233"/>summer, when the report will be
                            completed. It might therefore be most useful if the study group were to
                            look at certain specific problem areas more immediately. For example, if
                            one were to try to influence Peiping toward accepting a more peaceful
                            coexistence attitude then certain problems such as those presented by
                            the India-Pakistan conflict are not very helpful. On the other hand, in
                            Africa things are going very well and we might wish to capitalize on our
                            position there. He said he could think of nothing more important in our
                            longer range relations with Communist China than getting the Kashmir
                            dispute settled so that India and Pakistan can live peacefully. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed fully, and
                            suggested an immediate effort by a very small group to get down on paper
                            in about ninety days some of the more important considerations. It is
                            less important that this be a completed and fully coordinated job, than
                            that it reflect the thoughtful work of a limited number of good minds.
                            Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed. He said we need in hand not an
                            interdepartmental coordinated draft but a useful analysis.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary stated that it might be useful for him to dictate the
                            thoughts on his mind as to how events, as he sees them developing, might
                            affect the longer-range problem. He emphasized that this would be a
                            casually dictated paper over a weekend, stressing questions and problems
                            which trouble him, rather than a directive. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that this would be
                            excellent and just what the study group needed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also agreed.</item>

                        <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> agreed that
                            the Secretary's offer would be very useful and suggested that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and others might wish to do
                            the same. He commented that the problem is vast. For example, he cited
                            as just one possibility the consideration that China and the Soviet
                            Union could some day get back together again. Leadership in the various
                            countries will eventually change and particularly if the US suffers
                            severe setbacks in Vietnam this could attract the Soviets and Chinese
                            together. The implications of this should be considered. Another thought
                            that he had was the possible utility of attempting to bring pressure on
                            China through the use of wheat, capitalizing on their difficult food
                            problem. In this connection, he noted the problem of the dearth of good
                            intelligence on China, commenting for example that we had little
                            information on Chinese atomic capabilities. He stated he personally
                            doubts that it will be significant soon, though he anticipates an
                            attempt by the Chinese to make maximum use of the political potential of
                            their having become a nuclear power.</item>

                        <item>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that
                            they are making a major effort in the intelligence community to lay out
                            what we do and what we do not know. For example, he thinks that there is
                            a need for a study in depth on the Chinese economy. He said that the DIA
                            project on the military economy showed a greater capability than what
                            most of the “economists" <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0234"/>have
                            been saying. He said doubtless this reflects a dual economy in China,
                            one for peace and one for military use, but that we need a better
                            analysis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> tended to
                            disagree, stating that he believes a report could be drawn up now. He
                            doubts, for example, that a study in depth of the economy would have
                            much affect upon the results of such a report. In the relatively short
                            run of from five to seven years, China will be able to skim from the top
                            of its economy base whatever is needed for military purposes.</item>

                        <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said he is
                            struck by the concern of the present Chinese leadership with the
                            possible disaffection of the next generation of Chinese leaders. He
                            believes that the present leadership is taking precisely the wrong
                            measures by insisting on more rigid indoctrination. We might well look
                            at the possibility of capitalizing on this.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary said that we should look at the possibility of a food
                            crisis in China and how the US might capitalize on that. He wondered
                            whether a study by the Department of Agriculture might be useful.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said
                            Agriculture had done some studies, but he finds them rather incredible.
                            They tend to show that the Chinese could easily expand their agriculture
                            and feed their population, but this was based on the assumption that US
                            agricultural methods could be used. This was the big hooker. The
                            Secretary agreed that this is a questionable assumption. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested that
                            perhaps a study independent of the Agriculture Department might be
                            useful.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary asked if the Study Group were in touch with Professor
                            Taylor and his group at the University of Washington. He commented that
                            they were doing work on the economy of China. The response was negative,
                            but that the contact would be made. General Spivy commented that <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> is contracting with IDA for a long run
                            study on China, the information from which would be of interest to the

                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary suggested that one device which might be used would be
                            to develop a loose leaf study. On some parts we might be able to write
                            useful pieces immediately, developing the other parts as more
                            information becomes available.</item>

                            two additional problems particularly interest him. One has to do with
                            the possible admission of Communist China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the range of problems which that would present. He
                            suspected that this is a matter which we will have to face up to in the
                            not distant future. The second issue is the possibility of Indonesia
                            being taken over entirely by the PKI.</item>

                        <item>The Secretary stated that the central question, as he sees it, is the
                            need to influence a half-dozen key people in China on the question of
                            how China is doing, and whether its present policy is or is not on the
                            right track. Such actions as the recognition of China by France or its
                            future admission into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would, of
                            course, be very bad in that it would persuade the Chinese that they were
                            being successful. Unless other things demonstrate to the Chinese that
                            they are not on the right track we will be faced with much greater
                            danger in the future, not to mention that which we face today.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed, saying in
                            addition that if the US takes positions in opposition to the Chinese
                            which it cannot successfully back up, this only makes things worse. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed, stating there is no point in
                            opposing the Chinese in areas where we do not have the power to
                            influence events.</item>
                        <label>19.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary pointed out that successful opposition to the Chinese
                            would create a terrific burden. He noted that it required a trillion
                            dollars in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense budgets to stop
                            the Russians in Europe (but noted parenthetically that they still risked
                            the Cuban missile adventure). It is going to require a major decision on
                            the part of the US and its allies to stop the Chinese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed but stated that as a
                            government we have not really faced the problem of generating sufficient
                            power to convince the ChiComs of their error.</item>

                        <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> raised a
                            question as to how our studies and analysis might be used outside of the
                            US, perhaps in some sanitized version. He stated that he has been
                            impressed as to the lack of serious thought about the Chinese problem on
                            the part of our allies and others. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed and pointed out that since others do not
                            think about the problem, and he doubts the US ability to stop the
                            Chinese unless others are prepared to help, he wonders whether we will
                            not have to say this to them at some point. This applies especially to
                            India and Japan.</item>

                            <item>The same mnd planners who work on Blue Lion were involved in the
                                tdc/mnd war game in January 1965 and the major CPX of Plan Rochester
                                in April 1965. This accounts for the lapse in Blue Lion activity
                                during the first half of this year. At present, the mnd planners are
                                working on two planning projects; one an amphibious assault and
                                drive inland in a northwest direction from the coastal area west of
                                Canton to seal off Vietnam, and second, the logistic plan to support
                                a northwesterly breakout from the lodgment area in the vicinity of
                                Amoy. The first project is scheduled for a tdc/mnd meeting later
                                this month.</item>

                                at Taipei has suggested in a message to State that during <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s visit, the
                                President <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0237"/>might propose
                                that a general officer planner from the joint staff be sent to
                                Taiwan from time to time to review Blue Lion planning. Comustdc
                                objected to this on the basis that first, it is not necessary and
                                further, it would bypass <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. I concur with <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss>. If Blue Lion planning should be reviewed, it
                                is obviously a job for <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>.</item>

                                visit to Honolulu next week, I intend to discuss frankly with him
                                the ChiCom defenses in the south China area which are available to
                                counter an amphibious landing. I will point out to him in general
                                terms the kind of force which would be required to support an
                                amphibious landing and let him know that we are thoroughly aware of
                                the size of the task. I am sure he will get this kind of information
                                in Washington also. But it seems appropriate to speak frankly with
                                him during his visit here.</item>

                            comments by restating well-known Chinese position on Vietnam: “The only
                            way to <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0238"/>settle Vietnam question
                            is for US to stop aggression in Vietnam, withdraw all its forces and let
                            Vietnamese people solve their own problems.” This formula was repeated
                            several times during the meeting. Wang followed with list of US acts of
                            “aggression" against China, including alleged overflight Hokou, US
                            warships bombarding ChiCom fishing vessels, ramming of Lebanese vessel
                            by US sub in Chinese waters, overflights of pilotless planes, serious

                            discussed Lin Piao's article. Said “We communists have never tried
                            conceal our views,” and that “Chinese experience over past decades told
                            us it was necessary to use revolutionary war against
                            counter-revolutionary wars to get rid of imperialist aggression.”
                                <persName>Wang</persName> said Chinese are compelled to take up arms
                            for purpose of self defense.</item>

                            establish peace in sea. I said tide of battle now seems to have changed.
                            Said we prefer to seek peaceful solution rather than lengthy war. I told
                            Wang his side seemed to reject Geneva Agreement as basis for making
                            peace. Said we are committed by our national faith to the defense of the
                            SVN people. I stated most firmly that we will fulfill that
                            commitment.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> returned to Vietnam question. Said “reason why
                            you shout so loudly for peace talks is that you have come to grief in
                            battlefield … and met powerful rebuff….”</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> then read long article from People's Daily,
                            Sept. 9, on India's “frenzied provocative activities,” along the whole
                            Sino-Indian border. Said that after India provoked large scale armed
                            conflict in 1962, the situation on Indian border eased as result series
                            efforts made by Chinese side. But India never stopped intrusions in
                            Chinese territory. Incidents by no means accidental. Also charged India
                            with carrying out aggression against people of Kashmir. Said India-Pak
                            conflict entirely provoked by Indian Government. Claimed India's attacks
                            on Pak “could not be separated from backing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.” I said this charge was nonsense and told

                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I reiterated our strong determination to support <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against aggression and stressed that
                            American public firmly supports <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            policy in Vietnam. I told <persName>Wang</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>'s article looked like
                            blueprint for Communist aggression and that it reminded me of Hitler's
                            Mein Kampf. This stung <persName>Wang</persName> who retorted that
                            American actions since WW II resembled those of Hitler, Mussolini, and
                            Japanese aggressors. <persName>Wang</persName> charged large numbers of
                            US troops deployed all over world and repeated familiar line that US has
                            committed aggression against Korea, Vietnam, Dominican Republic and
                            Congo.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> reiterated support for Vietnamese people. Said
                            US “aggression against Vietnam also jeopardizes security of whole
                            Indo-China <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0239"/>and our own
                            country,” and “no force can shake our determination to support
                            Vietnamese people.” <persName>Wang</persName> said everybody can see
                            clearly who does not want peace. While US talks of peace it continues
                            send troops and wantonly carries out bombings.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> also said, “not only are we ready to settle
                            Taiwan and Taiwan Straits matters in peaceful way, we are also ready
                            settle peace in South-East Asia, but if you still refuse to withdraw
                            your forces this question can not be settled.” <persName>Wang</persName>
                            replied to my charge of Chinese aggression in Korea by stating China was
                            defending own national borders. He repeated VNA statement that 325
                            Division not in South Vietnam. I refuted this statement saying we had
                            prisoners.</item>

                        <item>I told <persName>Wang</persName> that I agreed that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> should be liberated, that they should
                            be liberated from aggression from the North and that was what we were
                            trying to do. I said they should settle their own affairs, and should be
                            free to do so by withdrawal of North Vietnamese as well as by American
                            and other forces, and by the withdrawal of very substantial aid and arms
                            given to the Viet Cong. I concluded by saying that I hoped these talks
                            would have more result in the future than they have had in recent
                            sessions.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Following the meeting I made the following statement to the press: “I
                            have, as you know, participated in these talks for the past three and
                            one-half years, first with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang
                                Ping-nan</persName> and more recently with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WKWG1">Wang Kuo-chuan</persName>. I believe that the
                            talks have served a useful purpose in providing a ready channel of
                            communications. I regret, however, that during this time there has been
                            little progress towards the achievement of a deduction of tensions in
                            the Far East. I am sure that my successor will continue our efforts to
                            reach a peaceful solution for the grave problems confronting
                            Asia.”</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bill:</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your letter of September 10<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">Not
                            found.</note> concerning my final session at the Warsaw talks and the
                        letters from Senator Fong and Vermont Royster.</p>
                    <p>After some consideration I decided not to suggest an informal session with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WKWG1">Wang Kuo-chuan</persName> because
                        our previous relationship had been rather cold and distant. I was agreeably
                        surprised after the meeting when he shook hands all around and wished me
                        smooth sailing. This was the first time <persName>Wang</persName> has unbent
                        and acted naturally in my presence. I hope he will continue to exhibit this
                        new side in the future.</p>
                    <p>I sent <persName corresp="#p_DD1">David Dean</persName> to the Chinese
                        Embassy on the day before the meeting to discuss the letters from Senator
                        Fong and Royster. Chinese Counselor <persName corresp="#p_LK1">Li</persName>
                        agreed to consider forwarding the letters. He said he would refer the matter
                        to the appropriate authorities. Two days later Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LK1">Li</persName> told us that he had consulted the
                        responsible authorities and regretfully could not accept the letters for
                        transmission. He suggested they be mailed directly. I am enclosing memoranda
                        of conversations for these visits.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">Attached but
                            not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>It seems to me that if we can maintain as reasonable a position as possible
                        during these meetings, we may achieve a long-range educational impact, at
                        least on those who read the transcript of the meetings in Peking. However,
                        it appears unlikely that the Chinese will abandon their position that major
                        matters, such as Taiwan, must be settled before minor problems can be
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>I hope to have a chance to discuss the talks more thoroughly with you when I
                        return to Washington.</p>

                            took place at a dinner given by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> for Madame Chiang. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> called on Chief of Protocol Lloyd
                            Nelson Hand on September 9 to state that Madame Chiang's visit, although

                                <persName>Johnson</persName>'s 1961 visit to Taipei. Hand stated
                            that since the Department had been notified that her visit was private,
                            it had made arrangements accordingly, but that the arrangements that
                            were made for a White House tea on September 14 and the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> dinner were beyond those normally

                    <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by stating that he knew there were many
                        things on Madame <persName>Chiang</persName>'s mind and he hoped she would
                        use this occasion to give him her views on any aspect of the world situation
                        as she saw it.</p>
                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> replied by stating that she would first
                        prefer to hear the Secretary's views.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that he believed one of the things foremost in the minds
                        of President and Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> was the Chinese
                        Communist nuclear explosion and he would appreciate her views on this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_CCNE1">CCNE</gloss> had a decidedly powerful influence not only on adjacent
                        Asian states but on the entire world. As a result of this development the
                        Chinese Communists' prestige and influence throughout the entire world had
                        been vastly increased. She stated that this development was a matter of
                        considerable concern to Asiatic nations including her own people in the
                        Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that France had a far greater nuclear capability than the
                        ChiComs. France had in 7 years only three megatons, a very small arsenal
                        compared to the enormous power of the U.S. The ChiComs could not approach
                        French capabilities. The Secretary said we should <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0242"/>assume that we are dealing with rational
                        men not lunatics and that no rational men would employ nuclear weapons
                        against the certainty of their own obliteration by the retaliatory power of
                        the U.S. Any such action would be purely suicidal.</p>
                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> replied that the Chinese Communists are
                        not rational men. They are insane with power and will resort to any means to
                        accomplish their objectives. She stated that ChiCom nuclear weapons had been
                        developed at enormous expense to the people of China and created extreme
                        hardship and in many cases starvation. She stated that their nuclear
                        capability was a threat not only to the surrounding Asian nations but to the
                        United States. She said that if two men faced each other, one armed with a
                        weapon that shot 50 bullets and the other with a weapon that shot only 2
                        bullets, the man with the lesser weapon could destroy the other before he
                        could use the greater weapon.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated in
                        substance, that the man with the 2-bullet weapon would never shoot if he
                        realized it meant his own death. He said that deterrent power rested not
                        only in superior weapons but on the willingness to use them if necessary in
                        retaliation.</p>
                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> stated that in the present situation of
                        increasing ChiCom nuclear power the only course of action for the United
                        States under the increasing ChiCom nuclear capability was for the United
                        States to (provide the means) to take out the ChiComs nuclear installations
                        now by the employment of conventional forces, to destroy now their nuclear
                        capability before it reached dangerous proportions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked what action the ChiComs would take if such an
                        operation were undertaken. Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> replied they
                        would raise a terrific uproar.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stated that in his opinion the ChiCom reaction would be
                        violent and would result essentially in the employment of their principal
                        weapon, their enormous manpower, in offensive retaliatory operations beyond
                        their borders. In this connection we could not employ U.S. manpower to
                        resist such action and would have to resort to nuclear weapons. In such case
                        the United States would be condemned by all the nations of the world,
                        including those on the periphery of China, for starting a nuclear war. The
                        Secretary stated that if the Nationalists were in Peking and such an attack
                        were made in China they would certainly react with all their strength.</p>
                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> stated that nuclear weapons would not have
                        to be used; that the ChiComs could not go far in operations beyond their
                        borders.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stated that the United States had only 190 million people
                        whereas China had over 600 million and that he hoped Madame
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> appreciated the impossibility of employment
                        of U.S. manpower in Asia against such odds.</p>

                    <p>Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> replied that she hoped that it was
                        thoroughly understood that the Republic of China did not propose the use of
                        any American troops against the ChiComs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Kung</persName> stated that in the development of nuclear
                        weapons the Chinese Communists were “winning" in the eyes of the world; that
                        by this accomplishment their prestige had been enhanced in the views of the
                        Asian and African nations.</p>
                    <p>There followed a general conversation on ChiCom chances in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and whether they actually desired
                        entering.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated he believed their condition of entry would be the
                        acquisition of Formosa.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that the meeting had been fruitful in the frank exchange
                        of views and expressed the hope that that discussion might be continued at a
                        later time.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that he had
                        always admired <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and was
                        especially pleased to note the economic development that has taken place
                        under <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s leadership.
                        Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> suggested at this point that they
                        dispense with translation from English to Chinese.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> said President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> had asked him to seek Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s views on how the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> can help the US in Vietnam. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded, first by
                        explaining to Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> with the use of maps, the
                        situation as the US views it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out the Viet Cong had apparently undertaken
                        what was intended to be a decisive campaign to cut South Vietnam in half and
                        to destroy the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> but that the added
                        weight of US forces had frustrated <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> plans
                        and forced them to revert to small scale guerrilla tactics. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then went on to say
                        that the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> is grateful for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> economic and technical aid and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> wants it increased; that the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> needs help especially in increasing
                        agricultural production. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> also
                        needs help in the field of transportation, especially water transportation
                        such as commercial ships and that the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                        needs medical assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that the war will be ultimately won or lost
                        by how well the government takes care of its people and that this is the
                        area in which they need help the most. Minister <persName>Chiang</persName>
                        thanked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> for his
                        briefing on the situation and stated that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be happy to do anything they could to help, noting
                        that Premier Ky had also talked to him in the same vein.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> said he wished to discuss the overall
                        Asian situation and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded that he was anxious to hear Minister
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>'s views on the subject. Minister
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> stated that three areas are of great
                        interest to Communist China: Korea, Taiwan Straits and Southeast Asia (now
                        extended to include India). Korea and the Taiwan Straits being strongly
                        defended, the ChiComs were devoting their attention to the south. In an
                        effort to expand southward the ChiComs had two areas in mind, Vietnam and
                        India, where it had felt US power could not reach effectively. As a result
                        of the stepup in US military effectiveness in Vietnam, the ChiComs feel they
                        can do little more there now and will shift their focus of activity to the
                        Indian border, and perhaps Thailand. The ChiCom objective is to spread and
                        scatter US resources like “ten fingers extended.” Minister
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> continued that he greatly admired the way
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had implemented
                        US policy in Vietnam, that he believed the ChiCom strategy had been
                        frustrated in <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0245"/>Vietnam, but that he
                        did not feel the ChiComs would give up their expansionist policies in South
                        and Southeast Asia.</p>

                            Yunnan, Kweichow, Szechwan)</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> said President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> had asked him to discuss the historic
                        development of certain things, and that what he was about to discuss were
                        things which need not be done immediately but which nevertheless should be
                        given consideration now. Again saying that he saw little chance of a ChiCom
                        thrust in Korea or the Taiwan Straits, hence a ChiCom focus toward the
                        south, <persName>Chiang</persName> said that from a strategic viewpoint the
                        5 southwest provinces of China are the most important because due to terrain
                        they form a natural barrier between “China proper" and SE Asia. If seized
                        (by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) they can shield SE Asia from
                        China proper. For this reason, President <persName>Chiang</persName> wants
                        to stress the importance of seizing the 5 SW provinces. He again said
                            <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> was discussing
                        only policy and strategy, not operational proposals. Minister
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> said Russia has never in history been
                        involved with respect to the 5 Southwest provinces, that ChiCom control is
                        weakest in these same 5 provinces, that resentment against the Communists is
                        strongest and popularity of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> is greatest in these provinces. At this point
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> left a small brochure to explain further
                        this concept.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">The reference is to a paper

                        important is that we consult more closely at high levels of government on
                        matters of Asian policy and strategy. Our common problems will be with us a
                        long time; they require constant contact and joint consideration from a

                        replacement of units with other units better trained and equipped. Air
                        buildup consists of increased training, more <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s, more and better radars although conventional AAA had been

                        thought that either US ground forces or nuclear weapons would be needed to

                        that the presence of US ground forces would change the nature of the attack
                        from an internal Chinese war to a foreign war, a change which would aid the

                        (protection from ChiCom air and sea attack) but would not need or want US

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the proposal
                        for seizure of 5 southwest provinces looked somewhat like the Bay of Pigs
                        plan in that it obviously contemplated large scale popular uprising against

                        asked what evidence the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had that the
                        people would rise. Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> replied that in the
                        5 SW provinces resistance to the Communists was strongest, hatred of the
                        Communists was greatest, Communist force deployments were weakest,
                        popularity of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> was
                        greatest. Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> said he had studied the Bay

                    <p>General <persName>Chiang</persName> introduced the discussion by stressing
                        the need for close collaboration between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. He felt that a thorough joint study of the
                        Chinese Communists was a necessary prelude to a common policy.</p>
                    <p>Although the United States had global responsibilities, he hoped that we
                        could proceed on a common path with respect to the Chinese Communists.
                        “Public relations are one thing”, but in our “serious discusions”, we should
                        adopt a “joint policy”.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo felt that any joint studies that were undertaken should be
                        “penetrating and sustained”. The Chinese strength on Taiwan should be used
                        effectively to help with the problem of the Chinese Communists. It is now
                        time “to put our heads together to work out a joint plan”. We may have
                        different views, but we must find a common meeting ground. The Chinese
                        Communists have an integrated policy toward both Taiwan and the U.S. and
                        this means that we should have “an integrated policy”. This is the essence
                        of President <persName>Chiang</persName>'s position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed that the Chinese Communist problem is a
                        critical one for both our governments. Although it is not the only problem
                        the U.S. faces, it is a growing one. He also agreed that the two governments
                        must consult and work together. We probably have difference in assessment
                        “at least at the margin" both within our own society and between our two
                        governments and this is an important reason for close consultation.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. has an immediate problem in Vietnam and Southeast Asia and we are
                        fully aware of the hostility of Peiping to the Republic of China.
                        Nonetheless, we cannot reach a decision that full-scale conflict with the
                        ChiComs is inevitable. Our policy is to contain Peiping and <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0250"/>attempt to avoid full-scale war. We have
                        many alliances in Asia, but our closest ally is the Republic of China;
                        within our own overall policy we desire to conduct the closest kind of
                        consultation and partnership with Taipei.</p>
                    <p>We have kept the situation on the mainland under close scrutiny because if we
                        ever felt that limited operations against Communist China could, in fact, be
                        successful we would want to examine those carefully. Thus far we have not
                        undertaken such actions—wisely. In any case, we are anxious not to undertake
                        actions which will enlarge hostilities in Vietnam or lead to a full-scale
                        conflict on the mainland.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> reiterated his view that the basic question is
                        how Chinese Nationalist strength can be used without touching off a wider
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded at 11:25.</p>

                        that President Chiang was especially interested to learn from the President
                        what U.S. policy is in the Far East and in what way the Republic of China
                        can help the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed appreciation for what the Chinese have already done
                        and the example they have set in the area. He informed the General that the
                        U.S. is proceeding with a military buildup in Vietnam which we think can
                        arrest the present dangers and, at the same time, avoid provoking an all-out
                        war in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The reports of the past month give us reason for cautious optimism. The
                        results during the monsoon season were especially encouraging. The U.S.
                        plans to stay in Vietnam until the aggression stops. There are some people
                        who feel the U.S. should undertake unlimited military measures, but the
                        Government feels that this will result in increasing the help being given to
                        the other side and that this would be unwise. On the other hand, there are
                        some who feel that the U.S. should pull out altogether. The U.S. does not
                        plan to pursue either of these extreme courses.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated his pleasure with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-initiated cease-fire in the Indian-Pakistan dispute. We will
                        do everything appropriate to encourage them to negotiate their differences.
                        The Chinese Communists, for their part, have done a great deal of talking in
                        the past week or so, but have not acted, and they have probably lost a great
                        deal of prestige in many quarters.</p>
                    <p>There promises to be difficulties in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on
                        the China question, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> thinks it will come out satisfactorily. The
                        President hoped that all countries would hesitate to reward Peiping for
                        their conduct in the last several days, but one never knows how other
                        countries feel about such questions.</p>
                    <p>The President asked General <persName>Chiang</persName> to tell President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> that we appreciate all the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has done in support of our common
                        objectives and that the U.S. remains a loyal ally of the Republic of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his high regard for President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> and his hopes for close collaboration with
                        him. He once again expressed his admiration for Madame
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0252"/>
                    <p>General <persName>Chiang</persName> said that his Government joined the U.S.
                        in the desire to avoid general war in Asia. The basic question is how “to
                        reduce or, if it is possible, to destroy Chinese Communist power without a
                        general war.” He had discussed this with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        and had raised a number of proposals for a coordinated U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> effort. The General emphasized that this
                        question was the essence of President <persName>Chiang</persName>'s message
                        to President <persName>Johnson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>General <persName>Chiang</persName> also noted that he had been asked to pass
                        on the Generalissimo's belief that the Chinese Communists would not
                        intervene “massively" in Vietnam or on the Indian sub-continent. Instead,
                        they will try to create turmoil through “revolutionary warfare" all over the
                        world. These tactics can last a long time and will dissipate U.S. strength
                        and efforts. They could have more dangerous implications for the U.S. than
                        massive intervention. He felt our common effort should be a long-term one.
                        There is a need for continued joint study. Although we may differ in our
                        interpretations, we should have common objectives.</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded at 12:15 with an exchange of gifts (an autographed
                        picture and some books from the President; two porcelain plates with
                        portraits of the President and his family from General
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>). The President then took General
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> into the press lobby.</p>

                    <p>1. In response to a request made September 23 by General
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> for a second opportunity to meet with Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>, <persName>Chiang</persName> was invited to
                        call at Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s home at 6:30 September 26 for
                        drinks. The meeting lasted until 8:15.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">U.S. Policy on Travel to Communist Countries</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. After an exchange of greetings, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that
                        he wished to inform Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> that the U.S. would
                        announce in the near future a change in its passport policy which would
                        permit doctors and public health workers to be issued passports with no
                        restrictions as to destination of travel. Thus, doctors and public health
                        personnel with legitimate cause for travel to Cuba, countries in Eastern
                        Europe or Communist China, and who have reason to believe they would be
                        admitted, would be issued passports. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed
                        out that this did not represent a change in actual practice, noting that
                        Drs. White and Rosen had been issued passports for travel to Communist
                        China, although in neither case had travel taken place. Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> explained that the President feels that the
                        humanitarian considerations involved should be separated from political
                        problems. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said also that this change would
                        tend to take one issue away from those who criticize our policies toward
                        travel to Communist countries as being too restrictive. He also noted that,
                        if any travel should take place, it might produce useful intelligence; this,
                        however, was secondary.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> observed that, although the announcement
                        will be worded in a general way, some people may take particular note of its
                        applicability to Communist China and draw unwarranted conclusions therefrom.
                        We do not anticipate that this will be a problem because 1) as in the case
                        of news correspondents, there will probably be very little travel resulting
                        from this announced change and 2) the U.S. attitude toward Communist China
                        is clearly shown by our actions in the Far East and by the recent strong
                        statement by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on the Chinese representation
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>4. Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> said that the travel of a few doctors
                        was not in itself an important matter, but that such actions as this often
                        are viewed as highly significant by people in the Far East who might see in
                        it a dilution of American firmness toward Communist China. The timing, close
                        to the opening of the General Assembly, was not too good.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that we also had had to examine
                        carefully the considerations raised by the Minister, but in sum had
                        concluded that 1) now was a suitable time for such an announcement and 2)
                        this move would probably strengthen our overall position vis-a-vis Communist
                        China. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> appreciated, however, that it might
                        not to be appropriate to make the announcement during the Minister's visit
                        to the U.S. and <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0254"/>said that he would
                        look into the possibility of having it issued after the Minister's
                        departure.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Current U.S. Thinking on Recognition of Outer
                            Mongolia</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>6. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> recalled the discussions which had taken
                        place in 1961 between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        on the subject of possible U.S. recognition of Outer Mongolia. He wanted to
                        inform the General that while we did not now have recognition of Outer
                        Mongolia under active consideration we did review the problem periodically
                        with special emphasis on two factors: 1) possible impact on the Sino-Soviet
                        dispute of U.S. recognition of Outer Mongolia; and 2) possible intelligence
                        benefits. The first factor did not seem important at this time, given the
                        extremes to which the split between Peiping and Moscow has already gone. As
                        far as the intelligence factor is concerned, this could become significant,
                        and it is possible that in the future, perhaps a few months, this matter may
                        come up for more active consideration.</p>
                    <p>7. General <persName>Chiang</persName> (apparently not understanding fully)
                        replied that as the matter involved only intelligence collection and not the
                        political recognition of Outer Mongolia, he saw no problem. Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> said that the two matters in this case were
                        inseparable. <persName>Chiang</persName> suggested that in that case this
                        was a matter for our two governments to discuss. Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> emphasized that in raising the issue at this
                        time he simply wanted to be sure the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        understood our exact state of thinking on a matter that had once been active
                        between us.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Chinese Representation at the General Assembly</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>8. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted the importance of the African votes
                        in the Chinese representation issue at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, complimented the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on its
                        active foreign policy in Africa, remarked on how much he had learned about
                        Africa during Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Hsi-k'un's visit to the U.S.
                        earlier this year, and said that we regarded as astute the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> handling of the recent problems with
                        Mauritania and Dahomey.</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that we believe we have a favorable
                        margin of about five votes, at this time, against a resolution calling for
                        the seating of Peiping and expulsion of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and a margin of some 15–18 votes supporting the Important
                        Question. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> emphasized the special importance
                        of the closest liaison possible between us on this problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">The Top Secret memorandum of conversation cited in <ref target="#d107fn1">footnote 1</ref> above stated with reference to

                    </p>
                    <p>10. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted the general excellence of
                        communication between us, and referred to specific proposals made during
                        Minister <persName>Chiang</persName>'s visit for strengthening the
                        mechanisms by which mutual consultation is accomplished. He referred to the
                        August 6 <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> operation which resulted in a
                        sea clash between <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and ChiCom naval units
                        and to which the attention of an element of the U.S. Seventh Fleet had been
                        drawn. He noted that the U.S. had not been informed beforehand of this
                        operation and indicated that the significance of such clashes for our
                        Seventh Fleet made closer liaison on such matters important to us.</p>
                    <p>11. Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> noted in reply that this had not
                        been an “amphibious operation" (as he had understood from an error in
                        interpretation) but only an attempt at landing 16 men for
                        intelligence-gathering purposes. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> remarked
                        that the problem apparently lay in the fact that ChiCom naval reaction and
                        capabilities had not been anticipated. General <persName>Chiang</persName>
                        agreed and said that it would be possible to strengthen liaison in these
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>12. Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> asked concerning the new U.S.
                        Ambassador, emphasizing the importance of his arrival in Taipei as soon as
                        possible. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> reviewed the factors which had
                        delayed this matter and indicated that within a short time we expected to
                        have more definite information.</p>
                    <p>13. On leaving, Minister <persName>Chiang</persName> expressed appreciation
                        for the courtesies shown him by the Department of State during this
                        visit.</p>

                        additional formal mechanism was necessary, and whether it would not be
                        preferable to have periodic informal exchanges between Ambassador on one
                        hand and Pres <persName>Chiang</persName> and/or DefMin on the other.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said that was what he had in mind,
                        that meetings should be informal and should take place whenever either side
                        wished them, and that no formal committee required. He said purpose in his
                        mind was to make an opportunity for exchanges of views between friends, with
                        no commitments on either side. He said sometimes diplomatic channels (by
                        which I think he meant all occasions when close records and close following
                        of policy guidance is required) too constraining, and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was seeking easier and less formal ways to
                        discuss what each side was thinking.</p>
                    <p>4. I asked for examples of subject matter, and he said that he hoped
                        discussions could deal with the general situation in Asia, and with
                        opinions, private or official, about future trends. He said that few if any
                        details or specific intelligence reports would be discussed, only general
                        principles and trends.</p>

                    <p>6. Comment: Believe this is significant retreat from previous request for
                        high level committee structure, possibly occasioned by my statement that
                        Dept may be having problems with formal aspects of proposal. Seems likely
                        that <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> and his father realize that closer
                        communication with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is highly desirable,
                        and that it has been hampered by Chinese desire, and US unwillingness, to
                        discuss such deeply held articles of faith as return to mainland, knocking
                        out ChiCom nuclear capability, etc. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>
                        visit designed among other things to show greater flexibility and
                        accommodation to US views, which they understand very well. They are now
                        asking for discussions and better communication between friends and assured
                        us that they do not wish to press for specific actions to be taken. Strongly
                        recommend that Dept instruct me to reply that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is pleased at prospects for closer exchanges of views and
                        agrees that periodic informal meetings between Amb and high level <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials will be very useful. Also would
                        like to say that Amb will carry special instructions from Pres
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> or SecState relating to these meetings, and

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Ed:</p>
                    <p>At the time of <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s visit
                        to Washington last September we discussed with him means of tuning up our
                        machinery for mutual <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0261"/>consultations.
                        We on our side felt this was necessary because of unmistakable indications
                        that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> felt excluded
                        from U.S. thinking on Viet-Nam and other Far Eastern policy problems. We
                        found our thoughts on this confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName>'s repeated mention while in Washington of the need
                        for closer U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> consultations on policy
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>We told <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> that we would
                        be ready to resume the Ambassadorial level consultations of the “Blue Lion"
                        committee, of which I think you are aware from the time you were in
                        Washington, when our new Ambassador arrives in Taipei. At the same time we
                        made no suggestion that the frame of reference for “Blue Lion" be relaxed
                        and we intend to adhere strictly to “Blue Lion" ground rules in future
                        consultations. These ground rules are: <list>

                                landing on the China coast on the assumption that uprisings had
                                occurred on the mainland;</item>

                            <item>that planning is to be based upon the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s current capabilities, without any additional

                            <item>that completed plans would be reviewed by the U.S. side, which
                                would make appropriate criticisms and suggestions to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>In general the purpose of these restrictions has been to obviate any
                        participation by us in joint military planning with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in connection with operations against the
                        mainland.</p>
                    <p>One other proposal that we made to <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName> was an exchange of intelligence appraisals of
                        conditions on the mainland. We hoped in this way to stimulate more realistic
                        thinking by the Chinese on the possibility that widespread dissidence on the
                        mainland would permit a successful <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        counterattack against the Communists. As by-products we might also gain
                        additional intelligence on the Communists and further insight into <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> thinking. There has been a continuing
                        exchange of intelligence on the Communists [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>] and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on a piece-by-piece basis; however, there
                        has not been the more searching and comprehensive type of intelligence
                        exchange which we have in mind.</p>
                    <p>The plan is that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will produce a study
                        which, after a review in the Department and in Defense, will be submitted to
                        the Chinese; the Chinese will produce a similar study for our review. There
                        might then be a meeting in which we and the Chinese would discuss our
                        studies and compare notes as to conclusions. We think it would be helpful if
                        someone from Hong Kong's political section could participate in such
                        discussions and we have made this suggestion to Embassy Taipei for
                        comment.</p>

                    <p>I would very much appreciate your own thoughts on this.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">Rice replied in a December 13 letter to <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that he had “some qualms" about
                            this. Predicting that the Chinese Communists would hear of it, perhaps
                            in a distorted form, he commented, “Some may argue it would be useful to
                            make the ChiComs believe we are working with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on plans for attacking the mainland, but I would
                            consider this a highly dubious and danger-fraught exercise.”</note> We

                        <item>At the December 15 Warsaw meeting we propose to give the Chinese
                            Communists clear warning of our intention to intensify our efforts in
                            Vietnam with full realization of the possible consequences. To balance
                            this strong warning we propose to say that it is incumbent upon both
                            sides to take some steps away from a direct confrontation in the
                            direction of a peaceful settlement. We propose to tell the Chinese that
                            we are taking certain unilateral steps in this direction.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We suggest that present U.S. policy be modified to allow for the
                            following new initiatives: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>We would state our readiness to admit Chinese journalists to
                                    the United States without reciprocity. Our present policy is to
                                    issue validated <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0263"/>passports to American newsmen and to press for either a formal
                                    or informal agreement on the exchange of newsmen. We have asked
                                    the Chinese Communists for such an exchange since 1959. Our
                                    efforts to secure an exchange are well known as is the Chinese
                                    refusal to agree. The offer to allow Chinese Communist
                                    journalists to come to the United States would almost certainly
                                    be rejected by the Communists, but when it became known we
                                    believe that this step would be welcomed by the American press
                                    community and the public as evidence of our desire to bring
                                    about an eventual exchange. In the unlikely event that the
                                    Chinese did accept such an acceptance would signal a major
                                    change in Peking's attitude towards the United States. We would
                                    not plan to publicize this offer until some time after the
                                    meeting.</item>

                                        1966, p. 90.</note> and informing them of our willingness to
                                    allow Chinese doctors and scientists in the same fields to come
                                    to the United States as a reciprocal aspect of such a move.
                                    While we do not plan to publicize this reciprocal aspect, we
                                    envisage at some point it will have to be made clear that we
                                    would have no objection to reciprocal visits on the part of the
                                    Chinese. We are virtually certain that the Chinese under their
                                    present policy will reject visits of Americans and will refuse
                                    to allow Chinese to come to the United States.</item>

                                <item>We propose suggesting to the Chinese that we jointly examine
                                    their charges of air and sea violations of their territory and
                                    attacks on Chinese vessels on the high seas. If the Chinese were
                                    to accept, which is possible but unlikely, we would plan to
                                    examine with them in Warsaw each new charge. We would not plan
                                    to publicize this suggestion. It is unlikely the Chinese would
                                    reveal it to the press. If they did, it would enhance our own
                                    image of reason and responsibility.</item>

                        <item>I believe that these moves are important to indicate to the Chinese
                            that we still seek to avoid a major confrontation. The moves suggested
                            will not be interpreted as a sign of weakness since our power position
                            in the Far East is steadily growing. But if the Chinese eventually
                            decide to look for a way out, this approach may ease the way.</item>

                            prove that we warned the Chinese of the dangers of a major confrontation
                            and that we took several unilateral steps to hold out the possibility of
                            an alternate solution.</item>

                            but transfer to Peking the opprobrium of being intransigent and hostile.
                            Chinese rejection of the U.S. moves proposed above would serve to
                            isolate them still further from world opinion.</item>

                        <item>One element in the balance of military forces in Southeast Asia is
                            seldom mentioned, for reasons I find difficult to understand. This
                            element is the half-million or so Chinese Nationalist ground forces
                            supported by qualitatively good though small air forces and naval
                            forces. The Chinese Nationalists are reasonably well trained and
                            equipped and are highly motivated against the Chinese Communists and in
                            favor of US objectives in Southeast Asia. They have argued strongly for
                            an assault on the South China coast on a scale that would threaten
                            logistic lines to Vietnam and probably would supply a considerable
                            number of ground forces for employment in South Vietnam if requested to
                            do so by the US.</item>

                        <item>Reluctance to use this Free World military asset stems from fears of
                            provoking or at least providing a public excuse for Chinese Communist
                            intervention in Vietnam. Now that some Chinese Communist troops (albeit
                            probably logistic ones) are already in Vietnam, this nicety on our part
                            may be somewhat anachronistic. In any case, I think we should do some
                            serious thinking about when, if ever, and how we might employ Chinese
                            Nationalist forces.</item>

                                    probably the greatest deterrent (short of US nuclear attack) we
                                    can bring to bear to keep Communist China from intervening
                                    directly and massively in Vietnam.</item>

                        <item>Somehow or other the admittedly delicate politics of using Chinese
                            Nationalist forces always suppresses serious inquiry into this subject.
                            My own feeling is that the kind of Communist threat we face in Vietnam
                            makes this particular political delicacy a luxury the US can ill afford.
                            If the Chinese Communists are forcing us into a war of attrition on the
                            ground in Southeast Asia, we should feel free to use Chinese Nationalist
                            troops against them.</item>

                        <item>128th meeting. Prior to meeting I was introduced to Ambassador
                                <persName>Wang</persName> and his staff. <persName>Wang</persName>
                            regretted that he had been unable to accept my earlier invitation to
                            have an informal conversation and tea after the meeting. He said he
                            really had another diplomatic engagement so he could not have tea but
                            suggested that we might get together at another time.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> took this opportunity to mention that
                            there had been a lot of “rumors" about the Warsaw talks lately. I
                            assured him that neither I nor my staff would divulge contents of talks.
                            It possible that <persName>Wang</persName> made this observation because
                            of press commentary about my visit to Paris prior to talks or because he
                            thought we might have used his acceptance of my invitation as basis for
                            more “rumors”.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> started meeting with some polite phrases of
                            welcome. In brief review of talks he said Chinese government has always
                            stood for peaceful settlement of Sino-US dispute through negotiations
                            and that his side would continue to take positive and reasonable
                            attitude towards peaceful settlement. He soon marred this auspicious
                            start by expressing <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0267"/>hope that I
                            would persuade <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to change its wrong

                            <persName>Wang</persName>'s attitude throughout the meeting apparently
                            was milder than his previous behavior. He read 20-minute long list of
                            alleged US provocations in quiet restrained voice. He did not raise his
                            voice when registering his government's strong protest and serious
                            warning concerning these incidents.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> listened attentively to my statement. His
                            interest was obviously aroused by our offer to jointly investigate
                            Chinese claims of Chinese fishing boat incidents on high seas, but he
                            later rejected this initiative. He also finessed our offer concerning

                            labeling my statements about doctors and journalists as old problems

                            <persName>Wang</persName> only became heated when, during his rebuttal,
                            he asked what threat Chinese fishing vessels which had been attacked on
                            the high seas offered to the US. He asked, “what right have your planes
                            to dive and strafe…. We have right to fish on high seas. What threat can
                            such small fishing boats pose? How can they prevent you from your rescue
                            work? What right have you to kill these fishermen?“</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> was careful not to make any new commitments
                            concerning Viet-Nam. However, he repeatedly stressed Peking's firm
                            intention to maintain its support for Hanoi. He emphasized China's
                            defensive rather than aggressive intent and said they would fight to
                            defend themselves. Unlike last session, <persName>Wang</persName> did
                            not dwell at any length on opposition of American public to
                            administration policy in Viet-Nam.</item>

                        <item>I believe our position at this meeting demonstrated our concern about
                            Viet-Nam and our desire to move towards a peaceful settlement. We also
                            indicated reasonable flexibility in our efforts to obtain some
                            meaningful contact with the Chinese. In both my opening statement and in
                            my rebuttal I asked <persName>Wang</persName> if his side doubted our
                            sincerity about unconditional negotiations why didn't they put us to the
                            test?</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I was impressed by inflexibility of Chinese position and their refusal
                            to give any indication of willingness to resolve the Viet-Nam crisis or
                            anything else on any terms other than their own. I believe that others
                            who listened to the talks will also get same impression. In this context
                            our SY officer has tape recorded this session of talks which were
                            broadcast by Polish transmitter concealed in or near the meeting room.
                            (I understand our British colleagues were also aware of the transmitter
                            in the meeting room. We may find that others also listened in.) <gloss target="#t_PZPR1">PZPR</gloss> Central Committee Plenum, now in
                            session, may have received prompt report of our talks. If so, I suspect
                            they also must have been impressed by our attempts reach some agreement
                            and by Chinese inflexibility.</item>

                        <item>I was also impressed by <persName>Wang</persName>'s evident belief
                            that US really was hostile and had aggressive intentions towards China.
                            He was particularly eloquent on these points during his rebuttal when he
                            was free wheeling and not reading from his text. He appeared genuinely
                            to believe US harbors aggressive intentions towards Communist China and
                            inter alia twice cited US assistance to <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            “gang" in slaughtering millions of Chinese as proof of US
                            hostility.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> seemed to be trying to drag out length of
                            meeting by reading long statement on ChiCom position on disarmament
                            (largely a repeat of previous stand). At end of meeting I suggested that
                            because of critical situation Viet-Nam, we meet next January 19. After
                            some discussion I agreed to March 16 date. Possible that delay until
                            March 16 may be further evidence Chinese desire to extend interval
                            between talks but we subsequently learned Ambassador
                                <persName>Wang</persName> and interpreter Chien will leave before

                            both before and after a dinner which the President gave for me that
                            evening; however, nothing of substance arose additional to the areas
                            covered during the afternoon call. Chinese present were: President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>; Minister of

                            Interpreter. On the U.S. side, in addition to General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, were Charge d'Affaires and
                            Ambassador Ad Interim <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">A. W. Hummel,

                        <item>This long conversation was conducted in a friendly atmosphere and the
                            President was calm and courteous although frank and direct (I understand
                            from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> unusually so).
                            Moreover, the President repeated several times that he desired that I
                            convey his views to President <persName>Johnson</persName>, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</item>

                        <item>After the usual amenities and serving of tea, the President questioned
                            me closely regarding our strategy in Vietnam. I responded by quoting
                            President <persName>Johnson</persName> as to the limited nature of our
                            political objectives (no territorial ambitions; no bases; want predator
                            nations of SE Asia to permit their neighbors to seek their own destinies
                            unhindered by outside forces) and our consonant military strategy in
                            South Vietnam and North Vietnam. The President stated that not to go
                            into North Vietnam did not make military sense; however, he understood
                            the political reasons behind this American decision. The fact is that
                            the Americans do not recognize the North Vietnamese as merely puppets of
                            the Chinese Communists; the ChiComs are your enemy and must not be left
                            untouched if there is to be a lasting settlement in Vietnam. You are
                            already fighting Communist China by proxy; indeed, you are fighting
                            forces trained and supported by the ChiComs. There are Chinese troops
                            now in North Vietnam. It is time for a basic plan to be formulated to
                            deal with the ChiComs; such a plan is entirely lacking. Some time ago
                                <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> gave the U.S.
                            Government a plan for seizing and holding the five southwest provinces
                            of China, thereby severing the lines of communication by which the
                            Communists supply the North Vietnamese. To date, I have received no
                            reaction to this proposal.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I replied that we knew there are Chinese railroad engineer units in
                            North Vietnam and, probably, some anti-aircraft units. The <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> had told me that electronic intercepts
                            revealed four infantry regiments had been deployed there also. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of text not declassified</hi>] As to
                            the plan for invading mainland China, General Yu had briefed me earlier
                            that afternoon on the concept. The requirements for such an operation
                            were very large, as I had pointed out to the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> the needed naval and air effort would be great. The
                            President then made the following points: <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0270"/>

                                    the Vietnam problem until you have settled the problem of

                                    much greater extent. You should not send U.S. troops into North
                                    Vietnam or Thailand. You should think of ways to use <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces, and the best way to use
                                        <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces is the plan I
                                    have proposed to seize and hold the five southwest provinces of
                                    China. This plan would require no U.S. ground forces; <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ground forces could do the job
                                    and effectively sever ChiCom support to the trouble spots in

                                    problems. The ChiComs are in no degree as strong as the Germans
                                    were in Europe; you would not need to involve yourselves on

                        <item>Comment: An interesting sidelight on my conversations with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is provided by
                            the context of my earlier meeting that day with Minister of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> and certain
                            senior officers of the Chinese General Staff. This meeting lasted one
                            hour and twenty minutes. The greater portion of that time was devoted to
                            a general discussion of the situation in Vietnam, deficiencies in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces and a discussion of Chinese
                            proposals for additional military assistance in critical areas such as
                            modern radars, submarines, and an accelerated F–5 program. Only about
                            ten minutes was consumed by a briefing by <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0271"/>General Yu, Vice Chief of the General Staff, on the
                            plan for the invasion of mainland China to seize the five southwestern
                            provinces and sever ChiCom lines of communications into North Vietnam.
                            General Yu made the remarkable statement that “99 per cent of the
                            population of the five southwestern provinces" would adhere to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s cause. Other than
                            that, I gained the distinct impression that the presentation was pro
                            forma and that the military had a far better appreciation of the
                            difficulties of transportation and air support required for such a
                            considerable operation. At any rate, when I pointed out the logistic and
                            other problems involved, very little rebuttal was attempted by the
                            Chinese officers except for the implication that I overestimated the
                            difficulties and underestimated the degree to which the Chinese people
                            would welcome <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s
                            return to the mainland of China. On the other hand, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> made two demands for
                            action in straight forward language. These were: (a) An explicit request
                            for the United States to put <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces
                            ashore to reconquer the five southwestern provinces; and (b) a complaint
                            that the U.S. Government fails to consult him with sufficient frequency
                            or to heed his advice when it is offered.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Recommendations: If one considers the age and background of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, his remarks
                            are perfectly understandable. He probably recognizes that the Vietnamese
                            War provides him with his last opportunity to return to mainland China
                            with any hope of establishing and maintaining himself there. Moreover,
                            he probably believes that if he were consulted more frequently he would
                            gain influence in U.S. Government Councils which, over time, would lead
                            to the adoption of the plan for the invasion which he advocates. In view
                            of the fact that his military staff continues unilateral planning for
                            the invasion, keeping our Embassy and our military personnel in Taiwan
                            informed, we can adopt one of two tactics in dealing with him. First, we
                            can tell him frankly that an invasion supported by United States forces
                            is out of the question at this time; or, second, we can continue our
                            present posture of being interested but uncommitted onlookers. I,
                            myself, advocate the first course of action, although it would have to
                            be done tactfully and perhaps sweetened by some addition of military
                            assistance to assuage his pride. As to additional consultation, I
                            believe it would be in the best interests of continued amity and
                            cooperation for the U.S. Government to consult with President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> frequently on many
                            aspects of Asian problems. After all, we would not be committed to
                            accept his views anymore than the views of other Asian leaders whom we
                            do consult on a regular basis.</item>

                    <p>1. The meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                        went about as predicted, in that he stressed the need for the United States
                        to recognize that the real enemy in Southeast Asia was not the Viet Cong or
                        North Vietnam, but was Communist China. He stressed as he has before that we
                        could not expect to match Communist manpower in Asia, and that it would be a
                        mistake to think that sophisticated weapons could replace manpower, the
                        objective should be to utilize Asian manpower with American logistics
                        support. He again stressed that the Soviet Union would not intervene in a
                        situation in which a civil war would be created by a Chinese “return to the
                        mainland,” on the grounds that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        commitment was in the event of a U.S. attack. He would not go into detail as
                        to the plans for returning to the mainland, or for further cooperation with
                        the United States in combatting Communism in Asia, but said that if we can
                        come to a consensus on the question of who is the real enemy, we can work
                        out such details.</p>
                    <p>Rather surprisingly <persName>Chiang</persName> commented that your peace
                        offensive was a wise and effective effort. He also commented that the
                        Russian moves were especially significant, and should be watched very
                        closely.</p>
                    <p>As all Asian leaders have stated, there has been a measure of concern about
                        the U.S. intentions in South Vietnam stirred by the peace program. But I
                        reassured him strongly that we had no intention of seeking a peace that left
                        our friends unprotected. I parried his question as to what you would do if
                        the peace effort failed, by saying only that this was a matter for the
                        highest policy level, and would of course be up to you to decide. But we
                        would undoubtedly take all measures necessary to defeat the aggression.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> looks rather old, but very healthy, with ruddy
                        complexion and obviously in full command of himself. There are no signs of
                        senility that I could detect. He, of course, asked particularly after your
                        health and asked me to extend to you his best wishes. The conversation was
                        extremely friendly and cordial, and there was no effort to press for
                        decisions, nor any hint of chagrin that he has not been consulted lately. I
                        gave him your warm personal greetings, as I did to the Chinese people both
                        on arrival and departure at the airport.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>This estimate focuses on the two factors which dominate the economic scene in
                        Communist China: a huge and rapidly growing population living close to the
                        margin of bare subsistence, and the regime's determination to invest in
                        costly weapons programs.</p>

                    <p>We noted in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 13–64, “Economic Prospects
                        for Communist China" (28 January 1964), that the information available for
                        an appraisal of the Chinese Communist economy is fragmentary, uneven in
                        coverage, and uncertain as to reliability. There has been no significant
                        improvement; although open-source information is currently supplying
                        somewhat more data on production trends, these data are still spotty and
                        consist mainly of percentage increases over an unknown base. A major
                        intelligence collection effort is focused on this target, and continuing
                        efforts are made to increase its effectiveness.</p>

                    <list>
                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>Communist China has managed in the past five years to pull the economy
                            back from the brink of catastrophe and has made progress in its programs
                            to acquire modern weapons.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The Vietnam conflict has not yet added serious strains to the Chinese
                            economy. However, a sustained increase in the level of fighting in
                            Vietnam, if accompanied by a comparable rise in Chinese assistance as
                            well as significant defensive measures within China itself, would add
                            greatly to China's economic problems.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>In any event, the Chinese economy faces slow growth, at best, over the
                            next few years. The primary causes will be lagging agricultural
                            production and a burgeoning population, but these problems will be
                            complicated by the ambitious military program and by the inefficiencies
                            brought on by Peking's ideology. In agriculture, despite somewhat <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0276"/>greater support in the last few
                            years, the regime is still not doing enough to achieve the yields
                            necessary for sustained economic growth. Since Peking's birth control
                            program will have little early effect, population pressure on the food
                            supply will increase over the next decade. This narrow food margin makes
                            the economy highly vulnerable to bad crop conditions. Moreover, growing
                            competition for resources in China's sluggish and nonresilient economy
                            seems likely gradually to undermine economic stability.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>In the face of even a critical food emergency, the present regime
                            would probably make only grudging and piecemeal cuts in its military
                            programs. Although China will continue to be a dangerous and growing
                            military threat, we believe that some future Chinese leadership will be
                            forced to a fundamental concentration on China's economic
                            problems.</item>

                            without a place to defect to. Said when time came and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces landed with US backing there
                            would be defections. I agreed that we would not expect actual rebellion
                            or defections at present time, but that intelligence appraisals might
                            show some indications which could be used in estimating likelihood of
                            defections. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> doubted there could be
                            such indications, but insisted that defections would occur when mainland
                            attacked. Cited recent IL–28 and LCM defections as evidence and pointed
                            out that both had occurred even in absence of battle conditions. Stated
                            that in wartime many more defections inevitable. Said that ChiComs
                            obviously fear their own people and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is best judge of state of mind of people on
                            mainland.</item>

                            useless any further discussions of unilateral <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans in Blue Lion framework. Said that without US help
                            no plan could succeed. Said that while <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> does not want or need US ground forces would obviously
                            need other help. Therefore unilateral planning is pointless.</item>

                        <item>He repeated at some length arguments we have heard before. Said that
                            ChiComs only fear strength, and that US show of weakness only encourages
                            aggressive acts. Said that ChiComs have stated that US forces total only
                            2 million, which must be divided into half million for US itself, half
                            million for eventual use Vietnam, half million for other areas, leaving
                            only half million for use on mainland China, which would not be nearly
                            enough and which ChiComs do not fear.</item>

                            that answer on GT–5 was result of Washington examination over several
                            months. GT–5 and peace offensive related only in general sense that they
                            both involve Vietnam, and that US is not at war with ChiComs and
                            therefore cannot consider the air strikes against mainland that would be
                            necessary under GT–5.</item>

                            try to furnish written document, perhaps morning of Jan 26, and that I

                            consider any significant action against ChiComs, even through agency of

                            are still anxious to exchange views on present situation, and to discuss
                            basic concepts and strategies.”</item>

                    <p>Comment: This four-month exchange is bringing to a head a fundamental but
                        usually submerged issue—the basic divergence between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> objectives in the conflict with Asian
                        communism. We have long understood that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        desire for war with mainland China and U.S. desire to avoid such a collision
                        run at cross purposes; but we have usually been able to mute and disguise
                        these differences.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s present proposal has the Gimo's
                        personal imprimatur. We have met it head on with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>'s best judgment. The result has made <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> unhappy, and it is
                        predictable that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                        himself will explode. Such an explosion may take the form of a private
                        letter to the President or, more likely, a blunt and passionate unburdening
                        on the next high-level American visitor to Taiwan; also, conceivably, some
                        attempts to complain to sympathetic Congressional leaders.</p>
                    <p>We should anticipate any such moves and apply soft soap generously; but there
                        is little we can do to provide the assurance Taipei seeks on an issue on
                        which our military and civilian thinkers are firm and <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0283"/>united. The immediate price we may have to
                        pay for exercising our realistic best judgment is some foot-dragging by the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on expanded use of Taiwan facilities
                        in connection with the Vietnam war.</p>
                    <p>In brief, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has pushed us harder than
                        ever on our central point of divergence and has received, politely, the
                        response it feared and expected. The result will further complicate U.S.-
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations in a year when they are
                        already clouded by the ChiRep issue and the 7-month non-appearance of a U.S.
                        Ambassador in Taipei.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I have a rather simple proposal that would serve our national interests in
                        the Far East and also preserve a rare talent within government service: that
                        Ambassador Reischauer be appointed a Special Assistant to the Secretary of
                        State (or Ambassador-at-Large), with responsibility for China operations
                        coordination and China policy planning.</p>
                    <p>As you know, Ed Reischauer plans to leave his Tokyo post this summer for a
                        new chair at Harvard; he intends to announce his resignation in April.</p>
                    <p>What I am proposing is that Ed be asked to postpone his departure from
                        Government for at least one year in order to serve, in effect, as
                        “Ambassador to Peking in Exile.” From what I know of his long and deep <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0284"/>concern with the China problem, I
                        regard the odds as better than even that he would accept such an
                        assignment.</p>

                    <p>There seems to me a clear and compelling need for such a figure at State. Our
                        highest-placed full-time China expert in Washington is currently Allen

                        either to an overseas post or a university this summer. Within <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> there is no one of deeply rooted China
                        experience above the rank of Office Director (Harald <persName corresp="#p_JHW1">Jacobson</persName>, who runs Asian Communist Affairs;

                        job as economic Deputy provides little opportunity for China planning). Nor
                        is there anyone on the Seventh Floor who would claim China expertise, much
                        less time for intensive China thinking. This leaves only the handful of

                        but not an operator or planner.</p>
                    <p>What we are confronting here is a shortage and generation gap produced by the
                        sealing off of the mainland, McCarthyism, and the Dulles-Robertson years.
                        There are wise and tough younger China specialists coming along in the
                        Service; but the Tommy Thompsons, Chip Bohlens, and Foy Kohlers simply don't
                        exist as yet.</p>
                    <p>In the circumstances, with China a permanent problem, and with no U.S.
                        diplomatic mission in Peking, we are in some danger of succumbing in
                        Washington to at least three types of unavoidable distortion in conducting a
                        Far Eastern policy. There is the distortion bred by our own China experience
                        (the “loss of China”, Korean war, public and Congressional opinion, etc.);
                        the Southeast Asian distortion (a narrowly Saigon or Bangkok perspective on
                        China); and finally the Soviet distortion (a Kremlinological view of China
                        that may be shaped both by the demands of our “détente" with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and by Moscow's own distorted view of
                        Peking).</p>
                    <p>In addition to whatever distortions may color our approach, we are also
                        endangered by the fragmentation of our present China operations. By this I
                        refer to the considerable number and variety of intelligence-type mechanisms
                        that have been set in motion over the past fifteen years on China's
                        frontiers and are now compounded by our Vietnam-related activities. There is
                        no one in Government at a senior policy level who has within his daily ken
                        the full sweep of our China activities from Tibet through Southeast Asia,
                        North Vietnam, the Taiwan Straits, and Korea—not to mention matters of
                        travel and trade. Such a review point is particularly important to the
                        extent that however much we may regard China as a series of separate
                        problems (i.e., Tibetan rebels, <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                        irregulars, over-flights fro<pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0285"/>m
                        Taiwan, medical travel, etc.), China regards us as one single problem—and is
                        highly sensitized to all the “signals" we may inadvertently be sending
                        through a variety of unrelated acts.</p>
                    <p>Ideally, what is needed is a China coordinator and China advocate of the
                        stature of Tommy Thomson. Ideally, too, such a man should come from the
                        career Service and should be unscathed by the McCarthy era. I have combed
                        the ranks of the career Service, however, and although there are some
                        vaguely promising names (perhaps Henry Byroade or Fulton Freeman), none
                        seems to me more logical than that of Reischauer. Ed is a man whose roots,
                        training, experience, and thinking cover China as well as Japan, Korea, and
                        Southeast Asia; his first and foremost field of scholarship was pre-modern
                        China (T'ang history), and he has applied himself both as an academic and as
                        an operator to modern and Communist China, also to the broad questions of
                        U.S.-China strategy. In addition, he has clearly earned his spurs within the
                            <gloss target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss> Club and in his press, public, and
                        Congressional relations. Finally, his standing with both Defense and the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is uncommonly high.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that Ed could be persuaded to put off his Harvard chair for at
                        least one year and take on such an assignment—provided that the
                        Administration made it clear that his services were needed. If he were
                        appointed, I would urge, for obvious reasons, that his role be publicly
                        described as that of a general adviser on Far Eastern affairs—not a China
                            watcher.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">A March 19 letter from <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> to Reischauer states that

                    <p>2. I have had a growing feeling that we are reaching the point when the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> (including the ConGen) must give
                        more attention than in the past to what might be called the question of how
                        much the traffic will bear in Hong Kong. In other words,there is some
                        optimum level of US activities, requests and pressures, both direct and
                        indirect, which if exceeded would detract from rather than advance over-all
                        US interests. This level is difficult to define, but I believe it is
                        important that we all make a conscious effort to recognise that a potential
                        problem exists. Otherwise, we may inadvertently step across the line and be
                        suddenly confronted with a major problem. The purpose of this message is to
                        share some of our thoughts; it is not intended to make specific
                        recommendations regarding specific matters.</p>
                    <p>3. My concern has been prompted by a variety of matters, some mundane in
                        isolation, others of major importance in themselves. The list includes the R
                        &amp; R program from Vietnam; liberty visits (which have been increasing) by
                        Seventh Fleet ships, including nuclear-powered ships and carriers which
                        conduct air strikes against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; a
                        considerable [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                        declassified</hi>]; strong pressure on the Brit Govt to take whatever steps
                        are necessary to prevent Hong Kong registered ships from going to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; almost constant pressure on the <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> on textile matters; <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> use of Hong Kong as a base for sabotage attempts against
                        the mainland; and an expanding US official population (such as the currently
                        active questions of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> liaison officer,
                        the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-requested position for monitoring
                        trade in items that might end up in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or
                        Viet Cong hands, and the second FAS officer position). Each of these can
                        probably be justified in itself, but we may be reaching the point where a
                        decision on one may adversely affect our interests regarding another—or all
                        of them.</p>
                    <p>4. In trying to determine the optimum level of our activities and pressures,
                        there are a number of unknown, variable, and related factors. One is the
                        ChiCom attitude, which in turn may increasingly become a function of the
                        Vietnam situation. Even if we were to assume that the <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0287"/>leaders in Peking were wholly rational,
                        trying to estimate their tolerance level would be difficult; the problem is
                        compounded by what is apparently an element of irrationality in their
                        outlook. We do not mean to suggest that ChiCom thinking is on the verge of a
                        conclusion that some drastic action should be taken against <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>, but we do judge that the ChiComs are
                        thinking more about Hong Kong and how it fits into the over-all
                        confrontation between them and the US and the West as a whole. This is, of
                        course, at a time when the Chinese Communists have suffered repeated
                        frustrations in their efforts to put pressures on us elsewhere in hope of
                        indirectly affecting the course of events in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>5. A second factor is of course the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> and the Brit Govt. This is to a large extent, but not
                        entirely, directly related to ChiCom attitude and actions. <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> and the Brits have about as much difficulty
                        as we do in predicting ChiCom reactions to matters affecting <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>, so we can not take much comfort in the idea
                        that if the <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> concurs in some matters, our
                        problems are over. The <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> attempts to be as
                        cooperative as possible, but obviously insists upon retaining the option of
                        reviewing a situation after the event even though it has previously
                        concurred.</p>
                    <p>6. A third factor is the attitude of the people of Hong Kong, particularly
                        the press, businessmen and other leaders of influence. In general, Hong Kong
                        has been remarkably insulated from political problems of the area, but we
                        sense the beginning of uneasiness, accompanied by the initiation of Chinese
                        Communist efforts to use labor unions and other organizations as sounding
                        boards for propaganda directed against our activities here. The <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> is no democracy, but it is acutely
                        conscious of the need to maintain an atmosphere of stability and confidence.
                        Apart from its relationship to law and order, such an atmosphere is
                        essential to Hong Kong's economic well-being. Hong Kong is something of an
                        economic miracle, but its success has been largely the result of
                        intangibles, which are not the soundest base for continued stability.</p>
                    <p>7. There is also the possibility that events in the area and our military use
                        of Hong Kong are almost inexorably leading us towards some sort of
                        commitment for the defense of Hong Kong against any ChiCom action. (In fact,
                        local press has on several occasions suggested that continued visits of
                            <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss> ships is to demonstrate such a
                        commitment.) As far as we know, this has not been subject of any recent
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> discussions. Nevertheless, it is a
                        point we need to keep in mind.</p>
                    <p>8. In sum, we think that Peking, the <gloss target="#t_HKG1">HKG</gloss> and
                        the <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss> people are giving increased attention
                        to the future of <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>, and that we must do the
                        same in order to avoid jeopardizing the usefulness which we now derive from
                        Hong Kong. This may mean at times foregoing something in one field in order
                        to protect our overall interests, and this may cause an outcry from those
                        involved primarily in that field. We will of course try to exercise this
                        overall judgment within the ConGen, and we hope that all <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0288"/>developments which may significantly affect
                        our interests in Hong Kong will be similarly coordinated in Washington.</p>

                        U.S. is hostile to Communist China. It is also clear they are inflexible in
                        their outlook. Their experience over the past forty years, their deep-seated
                        beliefs, their dispute with the Soviets and their projection of Viet-Nam as
                        a test-case, their vision of the future, and their nationalistic aspirations
                        have combined to convince them that their current policies are right
                        regardless of the consequences. It is highly unlikely that the present
                        leadership will alter its views.</p>
                    <p>Given these circumstances I believe that our present course of action—firm
                        resistance to Chinese Communist expansionism while at the same time
                        searching for means to establish more contacts and a reduction of
                        tensions—is the best course that we can pursue. Your role in this search for
                        more meaningful contact is most important. At your last meeting with Wang I
                        think you scored several points—particularly in telling him of the removal
                        of the travel ban on doctors, our willingness to admit their journalists
                        without reciprocity, our willingness to meet with them in an exploratory
                        committee to discuss the World Disarmament Conference and finally our
                        proposal to jointly investigate their claims of attacks on the high seas. We
                        hope to propose more of these small steps for the next meeting. We realize
                        that Peking will reject them as well. Nevertheless, <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0289"/>when these moves gradually become known
                        they will reflect our own reasonableness and our desire to move towards some
                        lessening of tensions. The Chinese rejections will prove they are
                        intransigent and their unreasonableness will cause them to become more and
                        more isolated.</p>
                    <p>I think you will be interested in the following recent observations from
                        Hopson, the British Chargé in Peking.</p>
                    <p>“It is supposed to be axiomatic that China does not listen to reason.
                        Certainly that has been my humble experience at this post so far. The
                        arguments of power and bitter experience are more likely to move her. Nor
                        shall we tame her by just giving her what she wants. It would be folly for
                        the Americans to dismantle the defensive system which is at present their
                        only means of deterring China from adventures outside her frontiers. She
                        must be taught that her present policies will not pay. At the same time real
                        efforts must be made to lead China back into the international community and
                        to show her the advantage of peaceful co-existence. There is no magic
                        formula for this. It will require strength, patience and understanding,
                        particularly from the United States and from the Soviet Union; and it will
                        be a long business. There is not much prospect of changing the attitudes of
                        the present Chinese leadership. We may even have to wait for a new
                        generation. Meanwhile we would be wise to keep our powder dry.”</p>
                    <p>Your report on the eavesdropping of the last session of the talks raises the
                        question whether we should consider suggesting to the Chinese that we hold
                        the talks alternatively in each other's Embassy rather than at the Museum. I
                        should appreciate your views on making such a move. On the other hand, there
                        may be some benefit in letting the Poles and Russians know about the
                        contents of our talks at the present time.</p>
                    <p>In view of the present situation in the Far East I think it would be best not
                        to have Sir <persName>George</persName> discuss our long term plans in that
                        area with Michalowski at this time.</p>

                        <item>We have become convinced, in watching the current Communist Party
                            campaign telling the people the U.S. is planning to attack China, that
                            the motive power behind the campaign is no longer primarily
                            precautionary. Rather it is a widespread belief which has grown and
                            which stems from the top, that we will soon launch major operations
                            against the mainland. Apparently it is conceived that these operations
                            may involve both aerial attacks and amphibious landings. We do not
                            believe this conviction can be dismissed as irrational, given the
                            premises on which it probably is based. It certainly cannot be dismissed
                            as unimportant since, in human affairs, acceptance of an outcome as
                            inevitable tends to make it so: leaders will not take with conviction
                            steps which might stave off an outcome they regard as fatalistically
                            certain, nor will they be so likely to forego actions which might make
                            it so.</item>

                        <item>A propaganda campaign of this sort, begun for precautionary purposes
                            and to gain certain side benefits (such as harder work from the people
                            and removal to the countryside of people who have no employment in the
                            crowded cities), can gain its own momentum which carries along those who
                            started it. But this factor, in our opinion, can at most help marginally
                            to explain the growing atmosphere of crisis which surrounds some reports

                            20 speech in Peking at a reception for the <gloss target="#t_NFLSV1">NFLSV</gloss> mission. In brief, he portrayed the U.S. strategy as
                            one of escalating our forces and capabilities in South Vietnam while
                            endeavoring to isolate our opponents there from access to outside
                            support. He asserted we were preparing implement this sealing-off
                            strategy by carrying out a sea blockade of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; bombings of Hanoi, Haiphong and parts of Laos;
                            occupying, in collaboration with the Thai and South Vietnamese, areas of

                            that we can be expected to react by attacking China. This would add to
                            Vietnam another theater—or possibly two, since Chinese access to
                            Cambodia might have to be via Laos—for the possible employment of
                            Chinese volunteers (selected men for possible use in Vietnam have
                            already undergone training near Kweilin). (FCH–6010)</item>

                            efforts would fail and that we might react by extending war to the whole
                            of Indochina and to China itself. Indeed, he charged we were even then
                            making preparations for such an eventuality. He described this as a
                            “possible" outcome, basing his conclusion on the “objective laws
                            governing the development of aggressive wars.”</item>

                        <item>There is a considerable gap between the “possible" of <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s analysis in December and the
                            growing belief in inevitability we get, from recent reports, and it
                            carries with it a sense of conviction which must, we think, derive from
                            more than mere objective analysis. Indeed, the areas we are evidently
                            expected to attack are quite specific, and they seem to carry the
                            inference of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> participation.</item>

                            the local Chinese Communists in Hong Kong are preparing for the expected
                            American attack and have even been told by the Chinese Communist party
                            that the southern provinces of China may be lost to the Americans before
                            the situation can be reversed and China can successfully counterattack.
                            This fatalistic acceptance of an initially successful American attack
                            reoccurs in FCH–6017 in the party discussion in Canton.</item>

                            circumstances and assumptions on which the Chinese Communist leadership
                            may have based its conclusions. They could include numerous statements
                            by official and unofficial Americans; plans involving the Khmer Serei,
                            whose activities and intentions the ChiComs have long been able to
                            follow in considerable detail; and information derived from top-level

                            Taipei seems too obvious to be dismissed; similar concern may well have
                            been aroused by its reactivation if indeed this has happened.) Finally,
                            there is the list of policy defeats, too long to be recounted here,
                            which the ChiComs have suffered in their efforts to isolate us and
                            create troubles elsewhere which would divert our efforts from

                            This irrationality, which equates containment to aggressively hostile
                            encirclement, assumes that India and the Japanese “imperialists" would

                            the future. Given the extent he is deified and his works are being
                            regarded as the gospel, it is clear that his thinking is playing a major
                            part. This could be so whether he is ill—he has not appeared publicly
                            for six weeks—or issuing ill-tempered directives from some rustic
                            retreat. We are tempted, in this connection, to search for parallels in
                            the last years of Stalin. We are also tempted to conclude he would
                            half-welcome a U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> invasion,
                            believing his two old enemies could, before he dies, be drowned in the

                            deal a mortal blow to the revisionism he sees affecting China (and

                                in 1958 Quemoy crisis is demonstrably diminished because of better

                                to believe that (a) ChiCom moves of recent months are precautionary
                                in the main, occasioned by concern that US might expand air war in
                                North Vietnam and into south China; and (b) reftel analysis tends to
                                take scattered lower level indicators (as in para 7) and assume they
                                represent high level ChiCom policies.</item>

                            <item>There is certainly cause for concern about ChiCom fears of US

                                however, that ChiCom fears should have effect on preventing
                                adventurous or provocative actions in Vietnam, and also should
                                diminish chance of ChiCom provocation against offshore islands if

                        that could tie up the issue for a year or more. He mentioned in particular
                        the study committee idea.</p>

                            <item>One highest priority task for American policy-makers in the years
                                ahead is to help domesticate the Chinese Communist revolution in its
                                relations with other nations—or, to put it another way, to help
                                reclaim the Chinese mainland to responsible membership in the world
                                community.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The importance of the task is self-evident: 700 million people;
                                the key to stability in Asia; the grandiose belligerent aims of
                                Chinese Communist doctrine; Peking's development of a nuclear
                                capability.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>This task demands not merely “containment”, but a multiple
                                strategy. Three chief aspects of such a strategy should be: (a)
                                traditional military containment—the deterrence of overt and covert
                                Chinese aggression, and resistance to such aggression wherever it
                                may occur (as in Vietnam or Laos on the one hand, India on the
                                other); (b) generous assistance to the fragile societies on China's
                                perimeter in the process of nation-building; and (c) systematic
                                efforts to help erode the Chinese totalitarian state, to influence
                                Chinese behavior, and to combat Chinese ignorance and fear of the
                                outside world.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>All three aspects, simultaneously, are essential to a broad-gauged
                                policy. With the first two, we seek to prevent a disturbed China
                                from inflicting harm on its weaker neighbors; with the third, we
                                attempt to induce more rational patterns of behavior on the part of
                                China's leaders and/or their successors.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The first two of these aspects have received much attention since
                                the Korean war. They underlie our network of military alliances and
                                our aid program; they are reflected in the Vietnam war today. But
                                the third aspect has been very largely neglected.</item>

                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>By the third type of strategy, I mean essentially the familiar
                                array of flexible initiatives—of instruments of leverage and
                                erosion—that we have brought to bear on the Soviet Union and Eastern
                                Europe for many years now: a freeing of the flow of ideas, people,
                                and goods—the instruments of contact, of communications, travel, and
                                trade.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>One primary reason for failure to develop this second approach has
                                been the residue of bitterness and suspicion here at home over the
                                “loss of China" and the Korean war; “flexibility" toward China has
                                seemed politically risky, and the Democratic Party has felt
                                especially vulnerable. In addition, the existence of an alternative
                                claimant to Chinese sovereignty—Taiwan—has acted as a brake against
                                China initiatives.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>A second chief reason of this failure has been the policy pursued
                                by the Chinese Communists themselves since the Korean war, and
                                particularly since the failure of the Great Leap Forward (roughly
                                1959–60). It has been and still remains evident that any and all
                                U.S. initiatives in the areas of communications, travel, trade, and
                                the like, would be currently spurned by the Chinese Communists;
                                Peking has made clear that for the foreseeable future the U.S. is a
                                useful Public Enemy, still Number One (with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now running a close
                                second).</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>However, the primary U.S. domestic arguments against a flexible
                                approach are today of greatly diminished significance. The
                                leadership of the so-called “China Lobby" has largely passed from
                                the political scene; public opinion polls show a high degree of
                                public tolerance for coexistence with Communist China (see
                                especially the newly issued Council on Foreign Relations study by A.
                                T. Steele); and recent conciliatory moves such as the <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> “Open Door" speech of
                                December 1963 and State's medical travel package of December 1965
                                elicited widespread press support and no Congressional criticism
                                whatsoever. (Note the Zablocki Sub-Committee recommendation last May
                                for increased non-diplomatic contacts with the China mainland. Note
                                also the total non-success of Mme. <persName>Chiang</persName>'s
                                recent public relations trip to the U.S.)</item>

                            <item>At the same time, the argument of Chinese intransigence or
                                non-responsiveness is only marginally relevant. The strategy of
                                flexible initiatives is based not on expectation of a favorable
                                Chinese response but rather on several near-term and longer-term
                                objectives.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Among the near-term objectives are: (a) a signalling to the
                                Chinese people that we are not eternally and implacably hostile to
                                China (despite their leaders' propaganda to the contrary); (b) a
                                rebuttal of the widely held view, among many of our allies as well
                                as neutrals, that Americans are obsessive and irrational on the
                                subject of Communist China; and (c) a shifting of the onus for
                                Peking's belligerence and isolation to the ChiComs, where it rightly
                                belongs.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>The major longer-term objective is the offer of alternative
                                patterns of relationships with the U.S. to China's leaders, to their
                                successors, <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0298"/>and to doubting
                                elements within the Chinese elite. Simultaneously, the objective is
                                gradually to help break down China's acutely distorted view of the
                                outside world that plots her encirclement and destruction.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>John</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I have inquired about Bob McNamara's reply to your inquiry which you
                        mentioned in your letter of February 12.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">In
                                <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>'s February 12
                            letter (ibid.) he referred to a December 17 letter to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, in which he observed that
                                <persName>Wang</persName> had referred repeatedly, and with emotion,
                            to incidents of strafing of Chinese fishing boats on the high seas by
                            U.S. planes and asked whether steps could be taken to avoid or at least
                            minimize such incidents. (Filed with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s interim reply of December 30; Washington

                        I understand that a close check has been made of the Chinese charges of
                        incidents on the high seas and that Bob will be writing to you shortly.</p>
                    <p>In view of your recommendation<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> commented in his
                            February 12 letter that he thought it was “useful" that the Poles and
                            the Russians had first-hand knowledge of the substance and tone of the
                            talks and that the United States should as much as possible gear its
                            presentations to the Poles and Russians.</note> we have decided to drop
                        the idea of shifting the talks with the Chinese to each other's Embassy in
                        Warsaw. The Chinese are undoubtedly aware of the Polish microphones and may
                        be talking to the Poles and the Russians as well as to us. Nevertheless,
                        until we detect any sign of change in the Chinese attitude we may as well
                        continue with the present venue.</p>
                    <p>The instructions for the next meeting are being prepared and they will get to
                        you in sufficient time to allow you to make any comment or suggestion you
                        may desire. I hope the next meeting goes off well. While I don't expect any
                        basic change in the Chinese position, it will be interesting to see if
                            <persName>Wang</persName> brings back any new attitudes from his recent
                        meetings in Peking.</p>

                                    support through <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> can be
                                    properly determined only after comprehensive analysis of (1) the
                                    US ability to augment local forces against the threat, and (2)
                                    the types of forces that can be more effectively produced and
                                    maintained by the recipient country than by the US.</item>
                                <item>b. Our major <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs
                                    should take larger account of the growing mobility and combat
                                    power of US general purpose forces, while realistically
                                    reflecting the degree of commitment of those forces. This
                                    should, of course, be done in the context of other US
                                    objectives, particularly those of a political nature.</item>
                                <item>c. US military assistance will not be designed to support the

                                <item>d. Estimates regarding the type and size of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces required to defend
                                    Taiwan and the Penghus against serious attack should be based on
                                    the firm premise of major participation, from the opening day of
                                    hostilities, by US naval and air forces.</item>
                                <item>e. While the US is firmly committed to the defense of Taiwan
                                    and the Penghus, US policy leaves to Presidential discretion
                                    whether to treat an attack on the offshore islands as an attack
                                    on Taiwan. The US is not committed to the defense of the
                                    offshore islands.</item>

                                <item>f. It would be in the US interest to maintain a continually
                                    modernized <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> air force of
                                    roughly the current size, and a navy similar to the one now in
                                    existence but with a reduced amphibious capability. Such forces
                                    are necessary both to supplement US capability and, in the event
                                    of a limited <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> challenge
                                    or probe, to provide the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                    with a capability to engage alone, permitting the US time to
                                    assess the situation and determine whether to commit its own
                                    forces or reserve them for a more serious challenge.</item>
                                <item>g. Planning will be based on reducing the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> force level from the present
                                    612,000 to 458,000 at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971. The major change from the present will be
                                    a reduction in the Army of 146,000 men. Particular emphasis
                                    should be put on modernization of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Air Force and the pattern of expenditures for
                                    the services should work toward the proposed force goal of
                                    458,000 men. Such a force can be sustained and kept reasonably
                                    modern, particularly as to its Air Force, with <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aid in the range of $90–100
                                    million for the early years of the planning period. Thereafter a
                                    total grant military assistance of $70 million will be
                                    sufficient, particularly if combined with a relatively modest
                                    sales program. During this entire period, efforts will be made
                                    to integrate grant military assistance with the sales
                                    program.</item>
                                <item>h. We should make clear to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> our view that their forces are too large in
                                    relation to the threat, and that the US is not prepared to
                                    underwrite modern <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces at
                                    their present level, in part owing to the stringency of military
                                    assistance funds. It is recognized that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will probably attempt to
                                    maintain a larger force structure than we deem desirable, and
                                    may well increase their defense spending in order to purchase
                                    additional military equipment. We should, as appropriate, argue
                                    the merits of a smaller <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                    force.</item>
                                <item>i. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will be encouraged
                                    to assume some of the operating costs presently borne by grant
                                    military assistance so that a higher proportion of grant
                                    military assistance can be applied to force investment.”</item>

                        <item>The dollar guidelines are based on the assumptions that: (1) <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> investment, starting with <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67, will be limited to that required in

                        <item>Also of significance is the outlook presented by delivery figures as
                            contrasted to program figures used in reftel. Total deliveries <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64–67 estimated $390 million for

                            million shortfall between NPP and program figures shown in reftel.
                            Looking to future, deliveries expected to average about $95 million
                            through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 with shortfall of

                        <item>Impact on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> militarily, politically,
                            and economically of a reduced <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is
                            likely to be gradual since the reduction itself is spaced over a number
                            of years and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> level for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 66–69 would still be higher than <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 63–65. Consequently, we do not expect
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reaction to take extreme or
                            dramatic form.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>We agree that as reduced <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> gradually
                            becomes apparent, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would probably
                            seek offset by increase in its own military expenditures. We also agree
                            that economic effect this added expenditure would be increased by <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> shift and disappearance of military
                            budget support. Yet, leaving aside the question of desirability of
                            supplying under US military sales program military hardware which we
                            were unwilling supply under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, the
                            question remains whether extent of additional <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military spending would actually cause serious economic
                            setback or extensively undermine economic development achievements. We
                            believe that regime is sufficiently aware of importance of economic
                            viability to security of state that it would seek to avoid this. In
                            final analysis of course, there is little US could do to prevent <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from allocating whatever funds it
                            believed necessary to maintain its military establishment but this is a
                            choice the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> itself must continually
                            make and not a choice which we force upon it.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> combined with increasing commitment
                            US military forces in area to Viet-Nam conflict would necessarily lead

                            remain sufficient to insure ability of US to continue to meet

                            to such analysis in planning cycle now underway. While policy remains

                            supported. For example, we consider it essential to base computations on

                            to plan inadequate and indefinable level of support for all

                            Taiwan may well be one of the candidates for early application of
                            President's policy (1 Feb 66 Foreign Aid Message) to shift gradually
                            from grant to sales basis in military assistance program when this can
                            be done without jeopardizing security interests or progress of economic
                            development. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has substantially
                            increased foreign exchange reserves in recent years. According to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>

                        <item>Chinese Representation. This is the real touchstone. I delivered our
                            message of “deep concern" and laid out the negative factors fully. They
                            got the message, and it was certainly wise not to take it further at
                            this stage. I suspect we will be hearing from them, and that the
                            argument must be raging in high quarters as to whether they should pull
                            out if the worse comes to the worst and some formula is presented that
                            offers the possibility of membership to Peiping. If they are to come to
                            the right answer, they must deeply believe that we are doing everything
                            possible to help them (e.g., in Vanguard below) and that, at least for
                            the present, we are doing our utmost to prevent unwise initiatives
                            (e.g., as has already been done with Canada).</item>

                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> is currently in a state of mild
                            jitters, reflected in excessive dwelling on the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> threat to Taiwan but more
                            conspicuously in the most unwise proposals for drastic emergency powers
                            that we know (from highly sensitive sources) that he has been putting
                            forward. I believe we can cushion his fear of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> action—if indeed it is <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0306"/>real—and his reaction to our continued negative
                            attitude on the Mainland planning seemed resigned. The internal
                            reorganization could be more serious, although the final
                            proposal—apparently much modified by <persName corresp="#p_YC1">C.K.
                                Yen</persName> and others—will not be too hard to present to the
                            world, especially in view of its pairing of reorganization with possible
                            elections within Taiwan. The underlying problem apparently is the <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>'s fear that his death could produce a
                            chaotic succession situation. Although the succession has now become
                            much more uncertain than we had supposed—with <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s stock down and health uncertain, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_YC1">C.K. Yen</persName>'s elevation—it is
                            hard to see why it should be so chaotic as the <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> appears to believe. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Ching-kuo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName>
                            are personally close and both strike me as being at heart “realists" who
                            do not really accept the Mainland mystique. As to the reorganization,
                            all will depend on what is actually done under it, and we need to do
                            some talking in the right places when the plan is surfaced.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and Military Facilities. I
                            encountered moderate pressure on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>,
                            but I think this can be met if we maintain roughly the planned levels.
                            They fully expect to spend more money of their own, including $5–10
                            million of military sales from us. They know we want them to reduce
                            their forces, but unless the economic pinch gets much worse it seems
                            wholly out of the cards that they will do so. There must be a latent
                            argument within the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on military
                            spending, and this could indeed break into the open if the <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> departed. For now, his voice is
                            decisive on the military side of the argument, and my judgment is
                            that—having made our basic view quite clear—we would be wasting credit
                            to no good purpose to hammer any harder. The whole <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> argument now has additional coloration
                            from the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is giving us
                            significant air and naval facilities, to the point where our air
                            transport squadrons will shortly be taking over the Chinese areas of
                            their major air base. So far, my visit gave no indication that they
                            would use this leverage overtly, but the time may come.</item>

                        <item>Economic Planning and Vanguard. This is our most important action
                            decision. I was tremendously impressed both by their internal
                            agricultural policy and by their expanded plans for Africa. They have
                            now appealed specifically for our support of the latter through the use
                            of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 wheat to generate local
                            currency. We ourselves would get a proportion of the currency, and,
                            since our local currency supply runs out in the fall, this would
                            substitute for gold flow. But, more basically, the “exchange of
                            resources" (K.T. Li's phrase) involved in our assisting a significant
                            technical assistance program for food in Africa seems to me a good buy
                            in its own right, with the major additional factor of its relation to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problem. While it can be argued
                            that the Chinese have the money themselves, their external accounts are
                            now slightly adverse. In <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0307"/>short,
                            I would recommend favorable consideration of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 proposal.</item>

                    <p>Staying Loose on China Policy. I'm convinced that China is fast becoming a
                        major foreign and domestic issue again, and needs careful watching. Though I
                        gather that the <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>'s “hint" of flexibility
                        was strictly his own (and rather premature, to say the least), why not let
                        it serve as a sort of trial balloon?</p>
                    <p>To withdraw from what was rather grossly overplayed by the press would only
                        start another debate with our <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> critics, and
                        also force us to eat crow later if, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has twice indicated, we may yet be forced to make a
                        virtue of necessity and accept an adverse Chirep vote in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, to start shifting our China policy now—before we've
                        carefully assessed all the implications, would be risky. We still lack any
                        firm feel for where the electorate stands, or for how our Vietnam enterprise
                        might be affected.</p>
                    <p>Yet there may be a way to have our cake and eat it too. It is to move
                        gradually to the same stance toward Peiping as we now have toward
                        Hanoi—i.e., if these people will only stop their subversion and aggression
                        and live peacefully with their neighbors, we are prepared to re-examine
                        co-existing peacefully with them. It is not we who are isolating Red China,
                        but Red China which is isolating itself. If we're going to be <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0308"/>forced to adjust our China policy sooner or
                        later anyway, there is virtue in doing so in a way which puts the monkey on
                        Peiping's back.</p>
                    <p>I don't want to overdo this prickly issue, only to urge the case for staying
                        loose till we can sort it out better. Signs of US flexibility would offend
                        Korea, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and above all Taiwan, but be
                        quite a plus with most other friends. More important is whether such signs
                        would tend to undermine our Vietnam stance or serve rather as a diversion
                        protecting our Vietnam flank.</p>

                    <p>At the suggestion of Hayes Redmon, here are some thoughts on how to handle
                        both the Fulbright China hearings and <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>'s remarks on China as highlighted in today's

                            <item>The Administration is in luck, so far, on both China and Vietnam
                                during the present phase of the Fulbright hearings. Two of the
                                country's top Asian specialists, Fairbank and <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName>, have supported us on
                                Vietnam and have offered constructive suggestions rather than sharp

                                central thesis on China policy is “containment—yes, isolation—no”.
                                This is a useful and memorable shorthand for describing a rational
                                policy.</item>

                            <item>As of this morning's papers, the Administration, through the Vice
                                President, appears to have adopted both (a) a friendly and positive
                                approach to the China hearings, and (b) the Fairbank/<persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> thesis itself, i.e.,

                    <p>I would urge that we now make the <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>'s line
                        the official Administration position. It gives us just the room for maneuver
                        that we will need in the months ahead. It should also help to avoid an
                        unhealthy polarization on China policy. Furthermore, it need not be billed
                        as a new policy.</p>

                                ways to reduce China's isolation, despite the fact that China has
                                been responsible in large degree for isolating itself from

                        of meeting I asked about <persName>Wang</persName>'s home leave and welcomed
                        him back. He seemed reasonably relaxed and courteous. In course of
                        conversation I mentioned he had missed Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s visit when he was on home leave.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> laughed and said perhaps it was just as well.
                        An army of photographers which had been lurking at the door was admitted by
                        mutual agreement. They left ten minutes later and I opened with an

                        <persName>Wang</persName> listened with considerable attention, despite
                        length of statement, and took extensive notes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName>'s response seemed short and almost perfunctory. He
                        read it with a calm and almost detached air quite different from his more
                        emotional charges of the December meeting. Part of his problem may have been
                        the lack of substance in his charges of US military provocations against
                        China. He could only muster up serious warnings 397 and 398 (without
                        details), a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plane and two US robot
                        planes shot down and March 2 attack on Chinese fishing vessel which caused
                        no damage. <persName>Wang</persName> threw in Taipei Sofa agreement, Kung
                        Kuan Airbase, and US Air Force activities and lodged what he termed a strong
                        protest and serious warning through me to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. He said he wanted to tell us in all seriousness that the
                        Chiang clique had been long repudiated by the Chinese people. “Taiwan will
                        certainly be liberated by Chinese people and US will never succeed in
                        perpetuating its occupation of Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> then charged that US since last meeting had taken
                        grave steps to expand its war of aggression in Viet-Nam. He listed
                        resumption air raids, Honolulu Conference, increase US troops in South
                        Viet-Nam, allied assistance, building bases round the clock in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and Thailand, to accommodate more troops
                        “to slaughter <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> people.” Said US mopping
                        up operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> burned, killed and
                        destroyed. Claimed US used poison gas and toxic chemicals. Said US was using
                        more barbarous means than those of Hitler and was not only expanding effort
                        in Viet-Nam, <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0311"/>but was trying to
                        spread war flames to Laos and Cambodia in attempt save self from defeat in
                            <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Said if US dared spread war flames
                        to all of Indochina, its efforts will only meet with more disaster, defeat
                        and nothing else.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> then lodged protest about bombing Chinese
                        Consulate Phong Saly, saying it was deliberate act of provocation and that
                        he was instructed once again to lodge strong protest to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <persName>Wang</persName> said US actions
                        proved US, not China, is aggressor. He repeated claim China does not have
                        single soldier stationed in foreign land. Said US can solve no problem by
                        attacking China and continued with comments reftel on Chinese determination
                        to fight to end.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> mentioned US peace talks plot and said test of US
                        sincerity is whether or not US honors Geneva Agreements with withdrawal all
                        troops, US must accept <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s four points,
                        Front's five points, and recognize Viet Cong as sole legal representative of
                            <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> people.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> then dredged up and dusted off April 1964
                        draft-agreed announcement on Taiwan Straits. Repeated it and said US
                        acceptance was only way to effect improvement in Sino-US relations. “If
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> really has sincere desire for better
                        relations it should accept the draft-agreed announcement.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> ended his initial presentation with this parting
                        thrust. I responded by reiterating that we had no hostile or aggressive
                        intent towards his country. Said we had treaty obligations protect Taiwan
                        against attack and said we hoped for peaceful solution this and other
                        problems in Far East. If we could agree to renunciation of force in Taiwan
                        Straits this would be major stride towards peace. I also dwelt at some
                        length on US sincere desire for peace in Viet-Nam. I told
                            <persName>Wang</persName> that I would request a further investigation
                        by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> on Phong Saly charge and would let
                        him know if there were any results of further investigation at next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> responded by repeating charge focus US strategy
                        has shifted to Far East. He said “aggression against our fraternal neighbor
                        is also a threat to our country so we can by no means sit idly by… . These
                        are facts and you cannot deceive others by lies … so long as you refuse to
                        change your policy it is impossible to improve relations.”
                            <persName>Wang</persName> said US has no right to say that there should
                        be renunciation of force in Taiwan Straits. “As everyone knows, it is an
                        internal affair and US has no right to interfere… . The only means to
                        improve relations is for US to withdraw forces from Taiwan and Taiwan
                        Straits.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Wang</persName> said that his side not fundamentally opposed to
                        talks but in problems like Viet-Nam it impossible have talks because US
                        aggression in Viet-Nam absolutely unjust and violation Geneva Agreements. He
                        said as long as US refuses to change its policy our talks about a relaxation
                        of tensions is false. Also said it impossible for his side take part in
                        disarmament <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0312"/>discussions because US
                        not sincere. In mentioning prisoners, <persName>Wang</persName> said his
                        government's policy was to give time off for good behavior. But said this a
                        matter for Chinese Government to decide. Made no mention of Captain

                            on September 20, 1965, that a U.S. F–104 plane had been shot down by

                            and that <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> had been captured.
                            Telegram 406 to Warsaw, September 21, instructed <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> to send a letter to <persName corresp="#p_WKWG1">Wang Kuo-ch'uan</persName> stating that the

                    </p>
                    <p>I made brief reply to <persName>Wang</persName>'s statement. Wang then ended
                        by complaining about leaks of the talks by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials. He cited three instantly (including that
                        reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1535). I think it is
                        advisable when mentioning the talks in the future to avoid any reference to
                        substantive content. <persName>Wang</persName> proposed next meeting for
                        June 22. I told him I extremely busy in mid-June with Poznan Fair and other
                        travel, and suggested mid or late May. <persName>Wang</persName> suggested
                        May 25 and I agreed. Meeting lasted three hours. After meeting I gave
                            <persName>Wang</persName> copy of testimony on China before Zablocki
                        committee and then asked him, in interest of becoming better acquainted, to
                        dinner at my home with his staff during week of April 3. He did not reject
                        invitation, but received it courteously. After deliberating he said he would
                        let me know.</p>

                        <item>In last week or so Embassy has encountered serious concern in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> about eventual drift of US policy
                            toward greater accommodation with Communist China. This is result of
                            estimate of long-range effect of domestic US policy debate, not
                            conviction that administration has decided or intends to decide to
                            change its attitude. However, those <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            officials with long memories, and this includes all the senior people,
                            seem to suspect that US fear of war with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, coupled with what they believe is manipulation of
                            US debates by subversive elements, will result during coming months in
                            relaxation of US determination to prevent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> admission of ChiComs. In short, they seem to think that
                            we may reenact some events of 1945–50 when, in their view, Communist and
                            leftist elements cleverly and successfully manipulated US policy. This
                            is nonsense of course, but there are, it seems to me, some compensations
                            in this belief, since it may be better for US officials to be considered
                            dupes than thought to be knaves.</item>

                            recommend we attempt some reassurance. This could be done in two ways:
                            (a) through continued high level public denials of change in US attitude
                            toward <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s entering <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and (b) personal and private message,
                            preferably from President <persName>Johnson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. Latter message should
                            if possible refer to recent public discussions among Americans who are
                            not in administration, and express resolve not to allow true <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position be misunderstood in third

                        reaching a better relationship with mainland China.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Our Policy Objectives</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I think we should have as our objective not only avoiding hostilities with
                        Communist China—hostilities which are likely if past and recent trends are
                        extended much farther. We should also have the objective of reaching a
                        live-and-let-live relationship with China. If we do not begin to pursue the
                        latter objective we are much more likely to get into war with China. And if
                        we are to maximize chances of achieving a live-and-let-live relationship we
                        obviously need a strategy for achieving it and a program to implement that
                        strategy. The possibility for a better relationship must be made evident if
                        it is to be considered a realistic option by <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s successors when he passes. The standard Chinese
                        Communist line is that we are China's irreconcilable enemy. If we do not now
                        plant the seeds of doubt that this is so, we are unlikely to gather their
                        fruit. If we wait till <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> dies and
                        then make efforts to influence the succession we may only ensure the
                        elimination of those among potential new leaders who were inclined towards
                        more pragmatic policies.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Obstacles to a Better Relationship and US Courses of
                            Action</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>From our point of view, a China which we can live with should be one which
                        pursues live-and-let-live policies towards other governments whose overthrow
                        it now seeks. We cannot expect Chinese Communist leaders publicly to disavow
                        the doctrines which call for such overthrow. We can hope for emergence of
                        leaders who may concentrate more on solving China's enormous internal
                        problems and divert fewer resources to pushing world revolution. Meanwhile
                        we must seek to see Communist China contained. Some countries will be more
                        disposed and better able to deal with threats posed by Communist China
                        without our interventions than with them. They may also be clearer-eyed
                        about China if they have first-hand experience with the Chinese Communists.
                        Our seeking to isolate them from the relevant contact, expecting them to
                        take <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0317"/>our evaluation of Chinese
                        Communist objectives at second-hand, may be no more appreciated by the
                        non-Communist leaders of those countries than by those of Communist China
                        itself. Thus we must pursue a policy of containment for the indefinite
                        future as in Vietnam, conceivably but not necessarily by similar means.</p>
                    <p>There are other obstacles in the way of a better relationship. One is the
                        fact that, according to Communist dogma and by definition, we are China's
                        main enemy because we are the strongest non-Communist power. We cannot
                        change the dogma but we can undermine its credibility, and challenge the
                        validity of Chinese Communist views that war between us may be inevitable
                        and, perhaps, ultimately necessary.</p>
                    <p>Our standing in the way of Chinese Communist acquisition of Taiwan is another
                        obstacle. The mainland regime cannot be expected overtly to accept this
                        separation as final: When China has been divided, nationalistic feelings
                        always have created pressures for reunification. But we can hope the Chinese
                        may learn to live with the situation.</p>
                    <p>There are other obstacles we can do something about. One is the fact that we
                        still are apparently committed to the overthrow of the Chinese Communist
                        regime. We appear committed to such a policy by virtue of our alliance and
                        intimate relationship with a Government on Taiwan which proclaims return to
                        power on the mainland its overriding objective. We should seek publicly to
                        disassociate ourselves from the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        objective of reconquest of the mainland. We lend credence to our own
                        presumed commitment to overthrow of the mainland regime by a whole set of
                        courses of action, overt and covert. Pursuing the policy of seeking the
                        overthrow of European Communist regimes ended a decade ago. Such a policy is
                        probably no more realistic towards China.</p>
                    <p>But courses of action designed to support it have not been reviewed,
                        evaluated and—where counterproductive—modified or abandoned. Speeches going
                        in a contrary direction will in any case evoke a hostile propaganda response
                        from the present Chinese leadership. They may be believed by some in the
                        world audience, which would be helpful in taking the monkey from our backs
                        and putting it on the backs of the Chinese Communist leaders. But speeches
                        accompanied by concrete actions may favorably affect the viewpoints of
                        numbers of Chinese Communists, including some who will succeed to leadership
                        before long.</p>
                    <p>An inventory of the overt and covert actions we have been taking against
                        China can be supplied (e.g. by the Department's Bureau of Intelligence and
                        Research). These courses of action should be evaluated from the standpoint
                        of their utility. Those which do not produce results which justify their
                        costs, or which stand in the way of attaining the objectives we should now
                        set for ourselves, should be modified or abandoned.</p>

                            <item>Our naval vessels sometimes cruise up and down through Communist
                                China's claimed territorial waters. If we and the Soviets do
                                something similar with each other, neither of us feels humiliated,
                                but the Chinese Communists remember all China's own past
                                humiliations, know China cannot do to us what we do to them, and
                                distrust us more than the Soviets do. If the situations were
                                reversed—a good touchstone of judging our international conduct—we
                                would feel the same. I find it hard to believe that cruising ten
                                miles from China's coast is necessary either to uphold our
                                reservations to a 12-mile limit, which we nearly accepted at one
                                point ourselves, or for other good reasons.</item>

                            <item>During the past century the West forced China to recognize that no
                                country can refuse to trade with the rest of the world. We now
                                enforce an opposite stand in our own embargo policy. With even the
                                Chinese Government on Taiwan allowing at least some indirect trade
                                with the mainland, we are being more Catholic than the Pope.</item>

                            <item>We are considering a project which, according to some of the
                                planners, would “assault" mainland China by radio. Initiation of
                                such a program would be regarded by the Chinese Communists as
                                another step in our pursuit of a policy of seeking the overthrow of
                                their regime. If it were conducted in the spirit of an assault,
                                their beliefs that we were conducting political warfare to that end
                                would be confirmed. This factor should be placed on the losses side
                                of the ledger in evaluating the project, which should be judged on
                                the basis of its utility in serving the policy objective of reaching
                                a live-and-let-live relationship with China. And unless we had a
                                clear Government policy towards China controlling such a radio
                                project, its personnel would of necessity formulate their own and
                                pursue it. I am not optimistic it would, in such circumstances,
                                serve the national interest.</item>

                    <p>Moreover, <persName>Arthur</persName> talked with Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, whose reaction he described as
                        “noncommittal.” If anything, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        preferred the 5-power approach (Tommy Thompson thought the Soviets wouldn't
                        want to be left out). Since Peiping wouldn't buy anyway (and the whole
                        virtue of the letter is to show our flexibility and its inflexibility), I
                        see little reason to risk three negative replies (<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, Brezhnev, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>) rather than only one. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> too prefers a more cautious approach to Peiping
                        alone first (he also points out that when the Warsaw talks began, Peiping
                        itself proposed they be at foreign minister level—thus giving us a precedent
                        to cite).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> also fears we're in real
                        trouble on the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> issue this year. He
                        sees the Japs and Canadians as ready to leave us. Nor will we gain African
                        votes in his view. So “we'll go down to defeat if we pursue our present
                        posture.”</p>
                    <p>He urges that we switch to a “Two Chinas" policy, which will show that “LBJ
                        is not a stick-in-the-mud”, and carries only limited risk because Peiping
                        won't buy anyway. The real problem, he admits, is Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>I urged that if he felt this strongly he should re-state his case to you and
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. I personally agree with him,
                        and note that all the hints about new flexibility in our China policy have
                        netted out a big plus so far.</p>
                    <p>In any case, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and I recommend
                        that the next step be to set up a small high level action group to work out
                        across the board recommendations to you. He suggests <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName>, and himself. But I'm Vietnam so this is more

                        leaking. But it will take your proposing such a group to get it off the

                            trip to several countries in the area. He sent
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> notes of his impressions of the
                            psychological climate in the area with a covering memorandum of April

                                <persName>Rostow</persName> sent the package to the President on

                    <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> made the point to him that the U.S. should
                        take greater care in its relations with its Asian allies to ensure that they
                        not appear as U.S. puppets. There was, <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> thought, in this an implied criticism of our treatment
                        of Vietnamese Prime Minister Ky and of the handling of the Honolulu
                        Conference. Cline thought there was also probably an implication, which
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> did not wish to make specific, that the U.S.
                        should take greater care with respect to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> itself to let it appear that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> actions were those of an independent country, not responses
                        to Washington's bidding.</p>

                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said that he found the state
                        of morale in the upper echelons of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        very bad. He found President <persName>Chiang</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> dispirited and discouraged.
                        They seemed to have lost the dynamism and drive which he had always found in
                        them in the past. During his conversation with Cline, President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> did not argue the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> point of view but told <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> that he had already made his points to American
                        officials from President <persName>Johnson</persName> on down, that they all
                        knew his points of view, but that he had failed to persuade them.</p>

                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> that he doubted that our present
                        military course in Viet-Nam could succeed. <persName>Chiang</persName> took
                        the view that manpower was one thing the Communists had plenty of, and that
                        we could not hope to defeat them solely by draining off their manpower.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said that this all led to
                        the usual <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> argument that the only real
                        solution to the Southeast Asian situation was an attack on the mainland of
                        China; but he thought that <persName>Chiang</persName> in advancing his
                        comments was sincerely persuaded that we were not on the right track in
                        Viet-Nam.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> talked to certain Chinese
                        officials, including a former Ambassador to Australia, Chen Chih-mai, about
                        the prospects for the Chinese representation issue in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. These felt that, if the U.S. made an all out
                        effort, it would be possible to get through the next General Assembly by a
                        margin of possibly 3 or 4 votes. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said that the fundamental <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                        that, while there was some prestige in membership, it was not really
                        essential. Chinese take the view that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        problem is really more a U.S. problem than one for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. They are willing to cooperate with us on
                        it, but they feel a defeat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be
                        more a U.S. defeat than a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> defeat. In
                        answer to a question by Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said he thought the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would go along with a tactic designed to
                        preserve its seat by making the minimum necessary gesture in the direction
                        of a seat for Communist China while safeguarding the position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>—but only if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was persuaded that we were doing this for the purpose of
                        helping the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, not simply to avoid
                        embarrassment to the U.S.</p>

                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said he found morale in the
                        armed forces poor, and especially in the Air Force. Air Force officers are
                        afraid that they are being rapidly outstripped by the competition on the
                        mainland and they no longer have confidence that they are a first-class
                        fighting force. Our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> has not been
                        sufficient to keep the Air Force in modern condition. A high number of
                        planes have been lost and a high percentage are deadlined for <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0322"/>repairs. He said that some 25 F–86s had
                        been lost last year. (On checking with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        we found the correct figure to be 11.)</p>

                    <p>7. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> wanted to know whether <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s somewhat unresponsive
                        attitude might not be a result of poor health. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> believed not; in fact, <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s health was about as good as it has been
                        in recent years. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said that the
                        younger <persName>Chiang</persName> is suffering from diabetes. So long as
                        he takes care of himself and does as the doctor orders, his health is good;
                        and in the last several months he has been very careful.
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> is now 55 and the doctors give him another 8

                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> observed that the election of
                            <persName corresp="#p_YC1">C.K. Yen</persName> is being interpreted as
                        President <persName>Chiang</persName>'s solution of the succession problem.
                        President <persName>Chiang</persName> is thought to have realized that it
                        was necessary for a person of the younger generation to be named as Vice
                        President. At the same time, he did not wish to set up as Vice President a
                        person of sufficient political power to rival <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>. The future pattern, as <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> sees it, is that <persName corresp="#p_YC1">C.K. Yen</persName> will occupy the titular position

                    <p>You will recall that in your last luncheon meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> there was a preliminary discussion
                        regarding the future strategy and tactics of the United States on the
                        Chinese representation issue at the coming 21st General Assembly. The
                        discussion was inconclusive, and I indicated that IO was in the process of
                        preparing a paper canvassing certain of the principal possibilities. Since
                        then, the President has expressed his desire to find a way of handling the
                        Chinese problem, including the Chinese Representation question at the next
                        General Assembly, which would get the U.S. off the defensive.</p>
                    <p>This paper discusses the principal possibilities open to us at the General
                        Assembly. None of them would, I believe, lead to Communist China's taking a
                        seat at the 21st Assembly. In the first place, it is not at all certain that
                        any of them would receive the necessary support for adoption, particularly
                        if the Assembly continues to uphold the requirement for a two-thirds
                        majority. Moreover, even if an invitation to Peiping were adopted, it would
                        be in the framework of a two-China approach. It is extremely unlikely that
                        Communist China would take a seat as long as the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> remained in the Assembly, and we believe it should be
                        possible to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to continue to
                        remain as long as its presence prevented the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s from taking a seat.</p>
                    <p>We assume that for this year at least the Security Council situation can be
                        controlled and that our principal strategy must be directed to the Assembly
                        and only thereafter to other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> technical
                        bodies where the question has arisen in one way or another in the past. The
                        risk would nevertheless exist that Assembly rejection of any new approach or
                        action that resulted in no real change in the situation, might well lead to
                        increased pressure for action in some other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> bodies.</p>
                    <p>There are several ways in which we could alter our strategy in order to help
                        place the onus for Chinese Communist exclusion on them, and to bulwark our
                        support and protection of the position of the Republic of China in the
                        United Nations. Although certain risks are attached to all of <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0324"/>them, I believe that the best way to
                        protect the GRC's place in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is for the
                        United States not to stand still. The risks of such a position are greater
                        than any other. The following are several principal courses of action,
                        listed insofar as feasible at this stage in descending order of preference.
                        Some could be used in combination.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">An Assembly declaratory resolution recognizing
                                    that there are now two successors to China's seat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, both of which should be
                                    represented in the Assembly.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>Such a resolution would be one approach to a two-China conclusion. It
                                would have the advantage over the study committee approach of being
                                more manageable and less susceptible to being broadened to cover the
                                questions of the other divided states. It would seek to preserve a
                                seat for the Republic of China. If the Chinese Communists refused
                                the seat offered them, as is likely, its seat would remain open and
                                the Republic of China would continue its membership. Any subsequent
                                pressure for a one-China solution should be manageable.</p>
                            <p>Such a declaratory resolution would seek to deal with the problem in
                                the Assembly. Our strategy would be to defer dealing with the
                                Security Council aspect until the situation in the Assembly had
                                clarified. However, we can anticipate pressure and broad support for
                                some kind of a General Assembly study of the Security Council
                                problem in addition to the problem in its broadest aspect.</p>
                            <p>If, as we expect, both Chinas once again affirm their opposition to
                                such a two-China approach, it is not clear whether the Assembly
                                would decide to take formal action on it. Nevertheless, our
                                objective of preventing the replacement of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> by Red China would have been
                                achieved.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Such a proposal would probably buy us another year. However, there
                                are some difficulties with the study committee approach which carry
                                risks for us. We would want the Assembly to deal only with the
                                Assembly; the study committee would be likely to want also to deal
                                with the Security Council aspect. There would be a real risk that
                                the outcome of the committee study might be a one-China, one-Formosa
                                solution or possibly even one China, and the wrong one.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the problem of obtaining a satisfactory composition
                                reflecting of sentiment toward both Chinas is a formidable one. We
                                would also have to decide whether to participate in such a
                                Committee, our tentative conclusion being that this would probably
                                be necessary in order to protect our position.</p>
                            <p>In short, the study committee idea seems less manageable and more
                                risky. We must recognize also that since Fanfani peddled this
                                proposal broadly last year and it is therefore well-known, it is
                                likely to be widely <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0325"/>regarded as a time-buying device and less attractive than a
                                substantive declaratory judgment by the Assembly in favor of a
                                two-China solution.</p>

                            <p>This has a number of disadvantages. Such an approach could well be
                                broadened into a negotiation of terms on which the Chinese
                                Communists might be prepared to enter the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There might be a recommendation for the wrong
                                China. Such an approach might be made very quickly and hence gain us

                                which it is unreasonable to ask it to adjudicate. The outcome would

                            <p>At the last Assembly the vote was 47–47 and the “important question"
                                principle was upheld by a margin of seven votes. There have been
                                some favorable developments in Africa and our present vote count
                                indicates a slight edge in our favor.</p>
                            <p>We do not believe, however, that we can rely on this present vote
                                count as the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> draws nearer. There
                                are likely to be serious defections among our traditional
                                supporters. The debate on China in our country has given rise to an
                                expectation of greater flexibility in the US position. The recent
                                Gallup Poll indicates that 56% of the American people would support
                                Chinese Communist admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                if this would improve US-Chinese relations.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the political price that we would have to pay if we are to
                                mount the extensive lobbying campaign required, particularly among
                                such restive allies as Italy, Canada, Japan and Australia, would be
                                prohibitively high. Finally, we cannot be certain that these tactics
                                would succeed even with exhaustive lobbying.</p>

                            <p>An important variant on the foregoing course would be for the US to

                                Of the courses mentioned, a passive attitude of this kind would do
                                less damage to our relations with the GRC than taking any initiative
                                toward a two-China approach but would give us the least control over

                                new approach to the Chirep question at the next <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. If the Chinese, contrary to our
                                expectations, agree, or if we decide to go ahead over their
                                objections, this would give us some control over the direction of
                                new moves.</item>

                                the initiative, we could simply stand aside this year, making it
                                plain to others (Canada, Japan, Italy, Australia) that they are free
                                to submit whatever proposals they choose to produce a solution, but
                                that the United States will maintain its present position and vote
                                against any resolutions designed to open the way to the entrance of
                                Communist China. In this way we would avoid any break with the

                    <p>The President suggested drawing on outside experts for advice on Chinese
                        representation. I believe the <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> Advisory
                        Committee, the members of which are listed in the attachment<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">Not printed.</note> would be an excellent group to
                        undertake such a task if we decide it would be useful. It has already
                        expressed a desire to discuss the Chinese representation question, and it
                        would be willing to make its views known privately if we so desire.</p>
                    <p>As you are aware, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                        and I will be consulting with the Canadians in Ottawa on May 16. Since
                        Canada has been pressing for discussion of Chinese representation and is
                        clearly anxious to undertake some new initiative, we believe we could make
                        good use of these consultations for a first exploratory discussion with
                        Canada. These consultations also make more urgent the need for a decision on
                        our part.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I understand through Bob Komer you would like my current views on the Chinese
                        Representation issue in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. You may
                        recall that after the decision in the General Assembly last year I wrote you
                        saying I was convinced we would have to move to a policy which would
                        recognize the right of both the Government of the Republic of China and
                        Communist China to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seats.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed this again recently with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and am especially anxious that we reach
                        an early decision. We are already being unusually pressed by the Chinese and
                        also by some of our friends such as Japan, Canada, and others about our
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Only you can make decisions required on this issue, and I hope you and the
                        Secretary and I can sit down and discuss the matter before I go to Ottawa on
                        May 17, where I will certainly be queried.</p>
                    <p>The attached memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">Not printed.</note>
                        explains my views in detail. In essence they are as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We run the grave and unacceptable risk of the majority vote going
                                against the Government of the Republic of China in next Fall's
                                General Assembly. There is even a substantial risk that we might
                                lose two-thirds majority vote.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Our new basic policy, both for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                tactical reasons and for broader strategic reasons, should be (A) to
                                assure maintenance of a Government of the Republic of China seat in
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and (B) to shift
                                responsibility for any continued non-participation by Chinese
                                Communists from us on to them in line with our developing concept of
                                containment but not isolation.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We should therefore support a “Successor State" resolution in the
                                next General Assembly which would recognize both the Government of
                                the Republic of China and the Chinese Communists as having <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>How we would get to the point is very important. I propose that as
                                the first step I be authorized to explore with Pearson and Martin
                                the <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0328"/>possibility of Canada
                                taking the initiative on the successor state resolution next Fall
                                without attribution to US: They are known to be interested in some
                                such move. If they decide to do it we should then make an early
                                approach to the Government of the Republic of China to assure them
                                we will protect their seat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                to the hilt but also to warn them we cannot be expected to oppose
                                Peking as strongly as in past against proposals to admit it. We
                                would have to consider carefully how and when people like the United
                                Kingdom and Japan would be informed.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>It will be much preferable, once launched, that a successor state
                                resolution be adopted. We should therefore not oppose it and at an
                                appropriate time, in consideration with Canadians, we might need to
                                come out for it.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>It may turn out that we would have to commit ourselves to some
                                degree also about the Security Council seat, although I would prefer
                                not to do this at this point.</item>

                    <p>1147. 1. We are disturbed, although not particularly surprised, by report in

                        to “counter current trend of appeasement in US toward Communist China.”</p>
                    <p>2. Judging by minimal impact of Madame <persName>Chiang</persName>'s efforts
                        to rouse American audiences, we doubt that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> campaign here is likely to accomplish desired objectives.
                        On contrary, it could work to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        disadvantage by souring even present support of current US policy on China,
                        particularly as result of concerted effort to attack personalities involved
                        in current public discussion of China policy.</p>
                    <p>3. We are therefore anxious to quietly discourage <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from propaganda effort at its incipience rather than having
                        to deal with it in more public fashion at a later stage. We realize that

                        making direct pitch to US public and that you are inhibited from using
                        information on special group contained in TDCS report. However, we wonder
                        whether problem cannot be discreetly discussed with key personalities in

                    <p>1258. 1. Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>) called me in
                        today to request reconsideration decision to withdraw F–104As and Bs.</p>
                    <p>2. He made it clear he was not questioning right of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to withdraw 104s but he was questioning manner in which
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had handled this matter and wished
                        to point out some of the problems caused to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. He said 18 aircraft could not be crucial element in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> deployments and likewise they were not
                        crucial to defense of Taiwan. He did not wish to make an appeal on military
                        grounds but was more concerned about other aspects.</p>
                    <p>4. He said after 18 March notification that 104s would be temporarily
                        retained President <persName>Chiang</persName> had approved organizational
                        structure, selection of pilots for training, and other activities directed
                        toward utilization these aircraft. If they now to be withdrawn “it would be
                        very difficult to explain to President <persName>Chiang</persName>” (he said
                        exactly this to Adm <persName>Sharp</persName> yesterday). Also would
                        inevitably cause morale problems in <gloss target="#t_CAF1">CAF</gloss> as
                        well as adding to widespread uncertainty in Taiwan about future course of US
                        policy. Some Legislative Yuan members, for instance, have apparently <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0332"/>given credence to rumors that 7th
                        Fleet mission in Taiwan Straits is to be curtailed or eliminated. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> of course understood that such rumors have
                        no basis but abrupt and untidy withdrawal of 104s will likely be
                        misinterpreted along similar lines.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> asked me to convey urgently to
                        Washington his request that decision be reviewed and reversed.</p>
                    <p>6. I said I understood his concern over way in which this had been handled
                        and that in spite of best of intentions it would with hindsight have been
                        much better if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had never authorized
                        temporary retention. None of us had any idea that “temporary" would mean
                        only a few weeks with consequent inconvenience to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and possibilities for misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>7. I suggested that imminent temporary deployment of one <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F–100 squadron to Tainan during May and
                        June would help relieve some local apprehensions, to which <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> agreed, saying he intended to visit the
                        squadron as soon as it arrived, presumably in order to generate local
                        publicity.</p>
                    <p>8. I said I knew enough from Washington communications to be sure there was
                        virtually no chance of reversal of decision now. However I would report
                        fully to Washington and see what could be done.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Admiral Ni made similar comments to me
                        last night, and Adm <persName>Sharp</persName> and Adm Gentner have had

                        justifiable irritation over US handling of this matter. However believe
                        deployment <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F–100s is the best answer
                        to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> concern and that Department should
                        authorize me to reply in a day or two regretting that decision on 104s
                        cannot be changed.<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">Telegram 1183 to Taipei, May

                            Meeting</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I attach a suggested draft letter to the Chinese Communists (Tab A) proposing
                        a Foreign Minister's meeting to discuss means of lessening tensions in the
                        Far East. We recommend that the letter be signed by the President. A
                        Presidential letter will both give the proposal greater authority and
                        prestige and, in the future, provide proof that the highest authority took
                        positive measures to reduce the risks of a wider war in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The letter could be delivered in Warsaw at the time of the next scheduled
                        talks on May 25. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>
                        might hand it to Wang without discussing its contents to avoid eavesdropping
                        by the Polish and others. Alternatively, the letter could be delivered by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>'s advisor
                            (<persName>Dean</persName>) before or following the next meeting when he
                        goes to the Chinese Communist Embassy to exchange texts of the opening
                        statements. Or, thirdly, Embassy Warsaw could deliver the letter to the
                        Chinese Communist Embassy prior to the May 25 talks.</p>
                    <p>While we are inclined to believe that the Chinese will reject the proposal,
                        it is possible that they may believe a refusal would be interpreted by
                        others as a further sign of Peking's intransigence. In the event they did
                        accept and specified Warsaw as the meeting place we would hope the meeting
                        or meetings would be held in a place (the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> Embassies, perhaps) safe from
                        eavesdropping.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should be informed
                        beforehand that we are proposing a Foreign Minister's meeting in an effort
                        to prevent <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> miscalculations of our
                        intentions. We must also tell the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, that,
                        while we believe the prospects for a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> acceptance are remote, we believe it is essential to
                        take all possible measures to avoid a wider war growing out of tensions or
                        miscalculations in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>We believe that, after transmitting the letter, we should also inform the
                        British, Australians, and South Koreans, at the highest levels only, that we
                        have taken this step.</p>
                    <p>We would recommend that this initiative be handled with great care. In the
                        event Peking declines the President's offer we should avoid <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0334"/>the temptation to make public the proposal
                        and their refusal (unless the Chinese themselves publicize the exchange). If
                        it is necessary, at some future time, to make known the offer the fact that
                        we did not use it for propaganda purposes at the time will lend added weight
                        and meaning to our move.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>In the light of mounting tensions in the Far East I have considered for
                            some time whether it would be wise to have meeting of our respective
                            Foreign Ministers to discuss the grave issues of peace and war and to
                            seek some means of lessening tensions in Asia.</p>
                        <p>You may recall that your representative at the Ambassadorial talks in
                            Geneva originally raised the question of a foreign minister's meeting.
                            Now I should like to propose such a meeting. My Secretary of State would
                            be willing to meet with your Foreign Minister either at the next session
                            of the Warsaw talks or at some other time or place convenient to your
                            Foreign Minister. I would propose an open agenda. Our objective would be
                            to provide each side an opportunity to discuss at a higher level some of
                            the questions we have dealt with in Warsaw, to consider frankly and
                            authoritatively our respective policies and intentions, to correct
                            misconceptions about our respective views, and to seek means to dampen
                            down the risks of a wider war in Asia.</p>
                        <p>In the interests of working towards peace and a better understanding
                            between the American and Chinese people I hope your Foreign Minister
                            will be able to meet with my Secretary of State.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>As you requested, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                        and I have reviewed the problems of Chinese Representation at the next
                        United Nations General Assembly to see whether the onus can be shifted more
                        clearly to the Chinese Communists for their exclusion.</p>
                    <p>There appears to be little prospect that our traditional position will be
                        sustained by the forthcoming General Assembly. In the last Assembly there
                        was a tie vote, and the question whether a two-thirds majority is required
                        was sustained by a very small margin. The two principal alternatives which
                        have been discussed in the General Assembly, as an alternative to our
                        traditional position, have been (a) a resolution expelling Taipei and
                        seating Peking and (b) a resolution inviting Peking to take a seat while
                        retaining Taipei as a member. The second alternative would almost certainly
                        not be accepted by Peking and would be far preferable from the point of view
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you authorize us to discuss these tactical problems with
                        the Republic of China in Taipei in an attempt to get them to stand steady,
                        rather than withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, if parties
                        other than the United States develop a “two Chinas" tactic at the 21st
                        General Assembly along the lines indicated in the discussion below.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we should discuss the tactics with certain other countries, in the
                        first instance with Canada and Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">The source

                    <p>Both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and I
                        conclude that relying on our previous tactics on Chinese Representation
                        involves an unacceptable risk of defeat and expenditure of U.S. influence.
                        As you know, in the past our approach has consisted of obtaining Assembly
                        agreement that any change in Chinese Representation requires a two-thirds
                        majority and defeating resolutions calling for the replacement of Chinese
                        Nationalists <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0336"/>by the Chinese
                        Communists. A number of our friends such as the Canadians, are no longer
                        prepared to go along with this approach. If we do not now devise new
                        tactics, we might see the next Assembly evict the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and invite the Chinese Communists to occupy the Chinese
                        seat in all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organs. The international and
                        domestic repercussions of such a development would be strongly adverse to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>In canvassing the alternatives, we concluded that one course with the fewest
                        risks involves a “two-Chinas" approach, and that we should not oppose such a
                        course if others raise it. The objective would be to reaffirm that the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has a right to representation in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, while opening the possibility for the
                        Chinese Communists likewise to be seated. We would seek to confine this
                        proposition in the first instance to the General Assembly, leaving the
                        question of China's Security Council seat in abeyance until Peking is
                        actually in the Assembly.</p>
                    <p>If unexpectedly Peking were to make a complete reversal and decide to take a
                        seat in the Assembly along with the Republic of China, the Chinese seat in
                        the Security Council would be at once at issue. While there would be great
                        difficulty in retaining Chinese Nationalist representation in the Security
                        Council, it might be possible to avoid seating the Communists pending a
                        study of the whole question of permanent membership in the Council.</p>
                    <p>Both Peking and the Republic of China will vigorously resist any two-Chinas
                        solution. Our first problem, therefore, will be to convince the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> that our shift in tactics is required to
                        avoid total defeat and is designed to assure them continuing representation
                        in the United Nations. We would add that if they accepted the two-Chinas
                        outcome, there is every present prospect, although without complete
                        certainty, that Peking would not take a seat in the Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Domestic opinion in this country would be more receptive today than formerly
                        to such a shift in our policy. A Gallup Poll taken last month indicates that
                        56% of those questioned would favor Red China's admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if this would improve relations between us.
                        The recent Congressional debate also indicates a moderation of sentiment on
                        this subject, as does the general reaction to the steps we have taken
                        offering the opportunity for increased contacts if the Chinese Communists
                        desire them.</p>
                    <p>Our plan would be to have Ambassador McConaughy, shortly after he arrives,
                        take up the question with the Chinese, inform them of our decision to shift
                        our policy as the best way to protect the position of the Republic of China
                        in the Assembly, and explain to the Chinese that the best way to continue to
                        exclude Red China would be for the Republic of China to hold on to its seat
                        in the Assembly. In addition, we would ask Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> some time in June to make a
                        supplementary <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0337"/>approach along the
                        same lines. I intend to be in Taipei in early July and I could do any
                        follow-up work necessary to tie this down.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> will be in Ottawa on
                        May 16 to have a full day's discussion on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        matters. The Canadians are very anxious to be “unleashed" on this question,
                        and the Pearson statement of the other day, for all practical purposes, puts
                        the Canadians publicly in favor of a two-Chinas solution. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and I are agreed that we
                        should hold off the Canadians from launching a new tactic until we have had
                        fuller discussions with the Chinese in Taipei. However, the indications are
                        that the Canadian ideas are already reasonably well developed. Rather than
                        run the risk of the Canadians developing a new tactic inconsistent with our
                        objectives, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and I
                        are agreed that he should indicate great interest on our part to consult
                        fully with the Canadians on the details of a new strategy on the
                        understanding no new move will be launched by them pending our discussions
                        in Taipei in June.</p>
                    <p>Congressional consultations would await further exploration with Taipei.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s May 14 memorandum (<ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>) was attached.</note> is something
                        of a landmark since it recommends to you that we begin to shift off our
                        present policy toward Communist China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, starting with talks in Taipei.</p>
                    <p>I have the following thoughts, aside from underlining the need for the

                            <item>On the domestic scene it would be helpful if General Eisenhower
                                could be brought aboard at some appropriate stage. I believe he
                                warned <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0338"/>President Kennedy
                                that this was the only issue in foreign policy where he might take
                                out after him. If the facts were laid before him by Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and you put the
                                issue to him, it seems to me possible that—as in the case of birth
                                control—he might shift his position.</item>

                                In traditional oriental style, a shadow may lie across his term as
                                ambassador, as a bringer of bad news. It may be wise to let

                            and was under active consideration. Our assessment, based on 47–47 vote,
                            that past traditional tactic unlikely to hold, particularly since

                            on our part in any new thoughts Canadians had developed, stressing at

                            Japan, Australia, Thailand, and Philippines. Said we would talk to
                            Canadians again after we had talked to Chinese to try to induce more
                            realistic understanding of situation by them. In meantime stressed US
                            talking only to Canada and not even to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            in this sense. Asked Canadians to respect our confidence.</item>

                            yes it represented sense of need to bring Communist China into contact
                            with world but also that Communist Chinese views and behavior and their
                            conditions on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership made it
                            difficult to see how change could come. Said we could be guaranteed of
                            Canadian confidence and that they would give us their views on how to

                            earlier with <persName>Martin</persName> that he thought neither US nor

                            only to embarrass them in relation to Chinese. We had important
                            objectives with Sovs, such as nuclear treaty and non-proliferation, and
                            would not want to jeopardize Sov movement toward West. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said Sovs difficult to talk to
                            at best and <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> would be subject
                            almost impossible to discuss with them. Agreed to importance of factor
                            and said they would give it consideration.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said he very conscious of
                            difficult situation <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would
                            create in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Thought this period we
                            would have to ride through. Noted Molotov and Vyshinsky had been about
                            as difficult and nasty as possible but that exposure to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> over years had ultimately moderated their
                            behavior. Suggested exposure to counter-debate might similarly make it
                            difficult for <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s to maintain
                            outside China some of more outrageous positions they took at

                                    in order to cover in detail two points raised by the President
                                    with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>: that we would cease bombing in Vietnam if
                                    there were an appropriate response, and the underscoring that
                                    our objective in Vietnam is a peaceful settlement.</item>

                                <item>The discussion in paragraph 16 of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> proposal concerning
                                    non-first use. In this paragraph, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has a reservation concerning the first three
                                    full sentences at the top of page 7 (“Mr. Ambassador . . .
                                    convenience.”) These sentences have been cleared with Defense,
                                    but <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> points out that they
                                    imply our willingness to accept a non-first use agreement, which
                                    as you know we have consistently rejected in Europe and which,
                                    in Asian terms, would be inconsistent with our actual military
                                    plans for the defense of Korea and Taiwan. The question is
                                    whether we wish to be this responsive when we know that in fact
                                    we could not accept a non-first use agreement which did not
                                    cover other types of forces and weapons. Defense reports that
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                                    believes that this degree of forthcoming response is warranted,
                                    without significant risk. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> strongly favors it. Our own
                                    inclination is that this would not be a serious risk, but we
                                    must weigh the possibility of leak and serious concern in Seoul
                                    and Taipei.</item>

                                    communication stated in paragraph 17. The President has told
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> that

                                    in paragraph 17 specifically in order to smoke out the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s on the <gloss target="#t_WDC1">WDC</gloss> exploratory group. There is
                                    general agreement that these elements of the instructions are
                                    wise, but I flag them for your attention.</item>

                        <item>In preparing these instructions, we have re-evaluated the proposal
                            discussed with you last week that we give the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s a message suggesting a meeting at Foreign Minister
                            level. Such a message might be furnished in writing, and could be done
                            at any time without regard to the specific date of the talks. In the
                            last two days, Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> have concurred in the judgment that in the
                            existing political circumstances in South Vietnam such a message at the
                            present time would only be construed as a sign of weakness by Peiping,
                            and would not have the positive effect we had envisaged a week ago.
                            Thus, it would be our recommendation that we put this on ice for the
                            present, while arming Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> with a draft message which could be readily
                            reviewed and authorized if the circumstances changed at any time.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s views are

                            <persName>Wang</persName> is scheduled to open. We anticipate that he
                            will make bitter attack on U.S. for May 12 plane incident. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s have charged that shooting down
                            of Chinese plane over Yunnan was deliberate, planned war provocation.
                                <persName>Wang</persName>'s statement will probably echo May 13
                            Liberation Army Daily editorial which stated “While flagrantly extending
                            the war of <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0343"/>aggression in
                            Vietnam, US imperialism has openly declared that China is its chief
                            enemy and clamored that 'there exists the danger of war with China.' It
                            was at this very moment that US air pirates intruded into China's
                            airspace and made a surprise attack on Chinese aircraft. This was by no
                            means an isolated or accidental case but a well planned act of the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration—in attempt to extend
                            further war of aggression against Vietnam to China. . . . Nefarious US
                            imperialism is the biggest scoundrel of our times and an arch-enemy of
                            the Chinese people.”</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> probably will also list U.S. acts of
                            “aggression" against mainland China including: occupation of Taiwan,
                            “several hundred" intrusions into China's territorial airspace and
                            waters, and strafing attacks on Chinese fishing boats. He may repeat

                            intensifying war in Vietnam and bent on spreading flames of war to
                            China. It is likely Wang will refer to recent 4 points <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> gave in interview with

                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, in response to your charges concerning an intrusion of
                            your border on May 12 by U.S. aircraft and the subsequent shooting down
                            of one of your aircraft there appears to be considerable confusion about
                            what actually did occur. We did have aircraft in the <gloss target="#t_NW1">NW</gloss> sector of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> on that date. Our pilots claim, however, that they at
                            all times remained south of the Red River. They state they were attacked
                            by an unidentified aircraft and returned its fire. They saw it explode
                            but saw no parachute. We have checked carefully with our pilots and with
                            the <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0344"/>careful navigational
                            equipment that was available on the American aircraft involved; these
                            accounts concur that the U.S. aircraft were at all times over <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> territory. We repeat that American
                            pilots have explicit instructions to avoid flying into your air space.
                            If the evidence available to us should have been in error, we would of
                            course have regretted this intrusion into your territory.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Reverting to the case of Captain <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s flight in the Hainan area, we repeat that this
                            was a case of mischance and navigational error.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>As to the A3B aircraft on April 12, it too was far off course because
                            of navigational errors when it was attacked by your pilots. Nonetheless,
                            we understand that this plane was not over Chinese territorial waters
                            when it was shot down. We would like to know if there were any
                            survivors.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I am deeply disturbed by these incidents on both sides because
                            misinterpretation of the motives behind these incidents by either side
                            could lead to a further increase in tensions. I should like to repeat
                            what I said in our last meeting. We have no hostile intent towards your
                            government or your people. President <persName>Johnson</persName> has
                            said that we seek the end of no regime and our Secretary of State has
                            recently said we do not intend to provoke war. We have acted with
                            restraint and care in the past and we are doing so today. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> is fully briefed on details May 12 air
                            incident. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, by this time it should be clear that we intend to live
                            up to our commitments to the Government of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. We are prepared to continue our present action as long
                            as it is required to convince Hanoi and the Viet Cong that their efforts
                            to take over <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by force, terror and
                            infiltration will not succeed. At the same time we are equally and
                            sincerely prepared to seek a peaceful solution. We have stated time and
                            again that our objective in South Vietnam is a condition of peace in
                            which the South Vietnamese people can be free to choose their own future
                            without outside coercion or force. We seek neither territory nor bases,
                            economic domination nor military alliance in Vietnam. There are many
                            roads towards a peaceful solution. We are willing at any time to engage
                            in discussions or negotiations leading towards peace, without
                            conditions. Alternately we are willing to undertake a reciprocal
                            dampening down of the war. We will respond if others are prepared to
                            reduce their use of force. Specifically, we are willing to suspend or
                            even cease our air attacks on North Vietnam if Hanoi gives clear
                            evidence that it is prepared to take reciprocal action, for example with
                            respect to its infiltration of military personnel and equipment into
                            South Vietnam and its military activity and terrorism in South Vietnam.
                            Such evidence and suspension of the bombing could be determined by
                            mutually acceptable observers.</item>

                        <item>It seems clear to me that Hanoi will eventually realize that a
                            military victory is not possible. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> may hope to wait until the military <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0345"/>position is reversed, but this will not
                            occur. As Hanoi continues to send more reinforcements south we will be
                            compelled to reinforce the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Over a
                            period of time the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces will face further losses and
                            defeats. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, eventually, will
                            realize that it could avoid all this bloodshed and destruction by
                            evidencing willingness to engage in negotiations leading to a peaceful
                            solution.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I have noted that NCNA has commented on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement of March 16
                            before the House Subcommittee on the Far East. NCNA said that “all talks
                            about 'improving relations' and 'avoidance' of a state of hostility are
                            a sham.” The People's Daily of April 6 said that the hints of “goodwill
                            dropped by the U.S. are obviously part of its counter-revolutionary dual
                            policy, an attempt to undermine the Chinese people's fighting
                            determination and reduce their combat-readiness . . . The evidence is
                            increasingly clear that the U.S. imperialists are preparing to impose
                            war on the Chinese people.” Similarly observer in the March 29 People's
                            Daily said that “these blasts of good will set off by Washington at a
                            time when U.S. imperialism is working more energetically than ever to
                            concentrate its aggression on China, are indeed absurd and ridiculous .
                            . . . All such expressions as a flexible policy, 'without isolation,'
                            and 'more contact' are only pretenses for intensifying the U.S.
                            containment of China.”</item>

                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I regret that your government seems to reject all our
                            proposals for easing tensions. Judging from what your side says it
                            appears that you choose to believe that U.S. does not seek a better
                            mutual understanding. Despite our statements to contrary you say that
                            U.S. only wants war with China. As I have tried to indicate, such a
                            conclusion is not warranted by the facts.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>There may be other reasons, both internal and external, why you wish
                            to avoid a better relationship. Mr. Ambassador, we are willing to try to
                            reach some mutual agreement on peaceful solutions of such critical
                            problems as Vietnam but your side has rejected all such moves. We would
                            like to work towards a reduction of tensions and a better understanding
                            but your side rejects our efforts, We have explained our intentions
                            towards your country but your side rejects our statements because you
                            claim we are not sincere. You say we must prove our sincerity by actual
                            deeds, by accepting, in fact, your own solutions. Mr. Ambassador, your
                            side has its own convictions. So do we. In the interests of peace we are
                            willing to search for a just solution. Are you willing to do the same?
                            Mr. Ambassador, I intend to continue my efforts to convince you that my
                            government seeks a just and lasting peace. We stand ready to fulfill the
                            commitments we have made concerning travel contacts and visits, joint
                            investigations, and discussions concerning peaceful solutions of the
                            problems confronting us in the Far East.</item>

                        <item>I would like to draw your attention to the remarks I made at our 128th
                            meeting on December 15, 1965.<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">See <ref target="#d114">Document 114</ref>.</note> At that time I said
                            that “peace and stability in the Far East is as much in your interest as
                            it is in ours . . . It would permit the withdrawal of U.S. forces. If we
                            could be assured of peace throughout the Far East and the whole Pacific,
                            our fleets and our bases would no longer be necessary.”</item>

                        <item>There are a few additional matters I should like to raise. At our last
                            meeting, I told you that I would ask for a further report on your
                            charges that the Chinese Consulate in Phong Saly was attacked. I am
                            informed that we have no additional information concerning this
                            incident.</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I have noted with considerable interest Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>'s statement of
                            May 10 in which he said that China must conduct nuclear tests to develop
                            nuclear weapons, because, although China had proposed a non-first use
                            agreement to the United States, we had rejected the proposal. Mr.
                            Ambassador, does this statement indicate that your government would
                            consider an agreement to ban nuclear tests if it were linked to a
                            non-first use agreement? This is an important point and I would like to
                            ask you to seek clarification from your government. Perhaps you could
                            let me know about this matter at your earliest convenience. While we
                            believe that any disarmament agreement must be a rounded one which
                            covers all types of forces and weapons, we are interested in any serious
                            proposal that would contribute to disarmament. We are willing to explore
                            disarmament issues with your government either here at Warsaw or
                            elsewhere. In this connection, I would like to comment on Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>'s statements
                            about the World Disarmament Conference in his April 10 interview with a
                            Pakistani reporter for Dawn. He said that “a world disarmament
                            conference in the present circumstances will yield no useful, practical
                            results and will only provide U.S. imperialism with a smoke-screen of
                            peace under which it will freely expand its war of aggression against
                            Vietnam.” You may recall my earlier comments about the proposed World
                            Disarmament Conference. Last December I told you that we had our doubts
                            about the effectiveness of a World Disarmament Conference because we
                            believe it to be an unwieldy body that could make little positive
                            contribution to disarmament. Nevertheless, I indicated to you that we
                            were prepared to discuss the prospects for such a conference with you in
                            a small exploratory group. We hope that Premier <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s statement does not imply that
                            your government believes that such an exploratory group for a World
                            Disarmament Congress would not be able to make progress towards
                            meaningful disarmament.</item>

                    <p>On May 24, 1966, the President met with Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, Assistant Secretary
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                            Rostow</persName> for a discussion of China policy from 12:25 to 1:20
                        p.m. Prior to the meeting, he met with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> from 11:37 a.m. until 12:25 p.m. The subject of
                        that discussion is not indicated. (Johnson Library, President's Appointment
                        Diary) No record of the meeting has been found.</p>
                    <p>According to a memorandum of a May 24 telephone conversation between
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that at the meeting they had
                        “only gone over the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> business" and
                        that no decision had been made. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked “if we
                        were going ahead with Taipei,” and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0348"/>replied that “there was no final
                        decision even on that; the thought was that Walt would do some softening up
                        and we would then leave it until the Secretary goes out.” (Ibid., Papers of
                        George Ball, China (Peking))</p>
                    <p>A June 14 briefing memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> states
                        that as a result of the meeting with the President, they were asked to
                        prepare for Presidential approval an instruction for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">Walter P. McConaughy</persName>, whose appointment
                        as Ambassador to the Republic of China had been announced early in May but
                        had not been confirmed by the Senate, on the assumption that he would raise
                        the question when he arrived in Taipei. The memorandum states that <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName>'s approach “was essentially
                        conceived as softening up exercise" to be followed by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s conversations in Taipei in July.

                            <persName>Wang</persName> opened 130th meeting with prepared statement
                            containing no surprises. He started with claim that May 12 plane shoot
                            down over Yunnan was deliberate, systematic act of war provocation and
                            repeated <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> Defense spokesman
                            statement of May 12. Wang then handed over photographs of US fuel tanks
                            and rocket parts and claimed these were iron-clad evidence of incident.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> said incident definitely not accidental.
                            He then read list of other “war provocations" against China including
                            serious warning 399 through 402, the April 12 A3B intrusion, April 7 air
                            attack on Chinese fishing boats. <persName>Wang</persName> claimed facts
                            show US war provocations have been growing in frequency and intensity.
                            He said he was authorized to lodge serious warning and protest most
                            strongly to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> added, “You should think over carefully
                            what grave consequences you will have to face if you go on like
                            this.”</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> then commented on US China policy. Said top US
                            officials recently have said US has changed its posture towards China
                            from containment <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0349"/>plus isolation
                            to containment without isolation. He said these statements by bigwigs of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> indicate worn-out policy of
                            containment plus isolation has gone bankrupt. Also said policy of
                            containment without isolation is out and out fraud. “How can you succeed
                            in containing China? China can never be isolated. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> says it wants to enlarge unofficial
                            contacts with China and discuss questions of disarmament and non-
                            proliferation of nuclear weapons with Peking and does not intend to
                            attack China . . . US tries to cover its aggressive designs with flimsy
                            veil, but it can never succeed.”</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> said US has occupied China's territory of
                            Taiwan by force, built strings of military bases around China,
                            incessantly sent warships and military aircraft to intrude in China's
                            territorial air and sea space in its “unbridled military provocations.”
                            He also claimed US opposes restoration to China of its legimate seat in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; “US has imposed trade embargo on
                            China; openly declared China its principal enemy; shifted its global
                            strategy to Asia; and is feverishly planning carry its war of aggression
                            from Viet-Nam to China.”</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> 90, May 10). He said whatever
                            policies of hostility US may adopt, China will never make slightest
                            change in its solemn position.</item>

                        <item>Wang switched to Viet-Nam, claimed US had further intensified its war
                            of aggression, increased troops, stepped up air raids, used B–52s
                            against North Viet-Nam, used poison gas, US bent on extending flames of
                            war of aggression to whole of Indo-China, US instigating attacks by its
                            Thai and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> puppets on Cambodia and
                            Laos, US planes bombed Chinese economic cultural mission in Khang on
                            March 24. Wang claimed Mansfield's call for peace talks was swindle.
                            Claimed defeat of US in Viet-Nam a foregone conclusion, said US had
                            already changed 13 horses in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and
                            having difficulty finding 14th horse. “Like ants in frying pan, US in
                            very difficult position in Viet-Nam.” <persName>Wang</persName> said
                            only way out was for US to accept <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s
                            four points and Front's five points, withdraw all troops and recognize
                            Front as sole representative of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>

                        <item>Using Department's instructions I responded by telling
                                <persName>Wang</persName> that American pilots have explicit
                            instructions avoid flying into <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            airspace. I said that if evidence concerning May 12 plane incident
                            available to US should have been in error, we would of course have
                            regretted incident. Said I was deeply disturbed by incidents on both
                            sides because misinterpretation of motives by either side could lead to
                            further increase in tensions. I repeated President's statement that we
                            seek end of no regime. Followed up with Department's guidance on
                            Viet-Nam, US relations with Communist China, American prisoners, and
                            disarmament. I added that by not taking up our proposals for exchange
                            newsmen, doctors, educators, his side was making it difficult to prevent
                            its own isolation. <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0350"/>I defined
                            our concept of containment—defense of non-Communist countries who are
                            threatened by outside-directed force of subversion, and told
                                <persName>Wang</persName> that as long as Peking seeks spread its
                            views through force and revolution we will continue defend ourselves and
                            allies. I said our objective was to live in peace with his and all other
                            countries, and that I hoped in time his government will adopt same
                            objective. Said we hopefully looking forward to day when on cultural,
                            philosophical and other grounds there could be maximum of intercourse
                            between all nations. I denied use of poison gas in Viet-Nam.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName>, his advisor, and interpreter took special
                            note of my question whether <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou
                                En-Lai</persName>'s May 10 statement linked banning of nuclear
                            testing to a non-first use agreement. They consulted amongst themselves
                            for several minutes. Later <persName>Wang</persName> made no mention of
                            this statement nor did he refer again to subject of disarmament. This is
                            unusual since <persName>Wang</persName> almost always responds to each
                            subject I bring up.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> responded to my statement with long commentary
                            on US policy of containment. Said US only purpose was to carry out
                            policy of hostility to China. “US says one thing and does another.” He
                            said, “If US does not change and completely abandon old policy of
                            aggression against China, and refuses to withdraw all forces from Taiwan
                            Straits and Taiwan, then China cannot believe so-called sincere desire
                            of US to improve relations.”</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> denied China aggressive. Said China would
                            strive shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand with all oppressed people
                            for liberation, but that China has not committed aggression against any
                            country nor engaged in terrorist action or subversion against any
                            foreign country.</item>

                            nothing new. <persName>Wang</persName> also referred again to May 12
                            incident and said US explanation completely untrue. “Since US calls
                            itself strong power why shouldn't you have courage to admit this crime?"
                            Referred again to US air attack on Chinese Consulate at Phong

                                <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> is criminal who
                            intruded into Chinese airspace and will be dealt with according to
                            Chinese law. As regards Walsh, he was spy and must be dealt with in
                            accordance with Chinese law. <persName>Wang</persName> said he had

                        <item>I replied with rebuttal touching on May 12 plane incident, fishing
                            boats, and Viet-Nam. I repeated that if we in error concerning May 12
                            plane shoot-down and incident occurred over Chinese territory, I would
                            extend sincere regrets for this accidental encounter. Also said I was
                            concerned about his claim US planes attacked Chinese fishing boats and
                            would like to investigate them further to make sure that if incidents
                            did take place, they do not reoccur. Told <persName>Wang</persName> I
                            disappointed by his earlier rejection my suggestion we jointly
                            investigate these incidents. I also told <persName>Wang</persName> again
                            that US not hostile to his government or people. Said US <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0351"/>forces are in Asia in direct response
                            to situations not of our own making. His leaders preach war and
                            revolution and should not be surprised if other countries, particularly
                            those in Far East, are fearful of this threat to their own peace and
                            security. Consequently, many have asked for our assistance. I said
                                <persName>Wang</persName>'s side ought to test our willingness to
                            negotiate to prove if we have sincere desire reach peaceful
                            solution.</item>

                            next meeting convene on August 17. Wang replied he busy in August. He
                            suggested September 7 for next meeting. Meeting lasted two hours fifty
                            minutes.</item>

                        <item>Atmosphere of meeting was relatively mild. The Chinese did not make an
                            emotional issue of the May 12 plane incident, attacks on fishermen, or
                            other US “war provocations.” When <persName>Wang</persName> read from
                            his instructions his voice was low and deliberate. In some of his
                            rebuttals, particularly when discussing US hostility to China, he
                            abandoned his papers, raised his voice and became more excited,
                            gesturing and sometimes groping for words. He played same line over and
                            over, particularly on containment. He made no new points or new
                            commitments. His statement on Viet-Nam was routine as was his statement
                            on US relations with China. He rejected all prospect of relaxing
                            tensions through increased contacts.</item>

                    <p>Attached is the memorandum I wrote to the President November 19, 1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> Much of it is
                        now outdated, except the fundamental truth that the image of the President
                        abroad is the single most important factor in molding world opinion towards
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that today much can be made of the fact that the President has
                        achieved an extraordinary victory in the Dominican election in proving his
                        faith in the ability of people to decide their own future if given the
                        opportunity without interference. This ties in with his objectives in
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>We discussed the profound impression which the President's speech made on the
                        African Ambassadors. This I believe could and should be gotten across in
                        some way to the African peoples.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to carry the worldwide unpopularity and misunderstanding of
                        Vietnam along with an unpopular China policy inherited primarily from
                        Dulles. I feel the President could well gain in most parts of the world by a
                        spectacular change in attitude towards Red China. It would then, I believe,
                        be easier to gain better understanding of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Without being specific, I would suggest the President's acceptance of
                        “containment, but not isolation" through adoption perhaps of a two-China
                        policy. The Department has been studying this matter for five years to my
                        knowledge. But the subject requires considerable study to bring it up to
                        date, although a part of this has already been done. I understand there is a
                        notion being considered to let some other nation propose this in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without our opposition. The US would cover up
                        its past by abstaining. To me, this would miss a real opportunity for the
                        President to take leadership.</p>
                    <p>I fully recognize the problem of giving full support to the war in Vietnam,
                        while at the same time making a gesture towards Red China. But on balance I
                        see an enormous “plus" in this move towards obtaining greater credibility
                        and more understanding of our Vietnam policy in world opinion.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, there might be an opportunity for a public rapprochement with
                        Bill Fulbright as the instigator of the China hearings, without embracing
                        Fulbright's softness on Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0353"/>
                    <p>I can only assure you of one thing, that a suggestion of the above would be
                        opposed by the State Department for a dozen reasons, including unhappiness
                        in Taipei.</p>
                    <p>Bob McNamara had an unusually good public reaction to his Montreal
                            speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">Reference is to an address given by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on May 18 before
                            the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Montreal. The text is
                            printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                1966</hi>, pp. 14–21.</note> I am speaking of the body of his
                        speech, not his final proposal for the two-year service. I refer
                        particularly to his readiness to have a new look at our relations with Red
                        China, as well as his emphasis on other policies, rather than military
                        power, to achieve security. Of course, the latter got attention because of
                        Bob's position. He really said nothing new, but it confirmed the
                        newsworthiness of “man bites dog.” It seems to me, however, that since Bob's
                        speech went over well it might be worth while for the President to take some
                        occasion to indicate his support of Bob's ideas (omitting two-year service
                        proposal).</p>
                    <p>I mentioned to you the possibility of the President's taking leadership in
                        advocating action by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to break down
                        East/West European barriers, possibly at the conclusion of the Brussels
                        Foreign Ministers conference. An opportunity exists prior to DeGaulle's
                        visit to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>You asked me for suggestions. The above is all I can come up with this
                        afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed lunch and look forward to talking with you
                        next week.</p>

                        recent statements by US administration officials, Congressional leaders and
                        private citizens <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0354"/>on subject of US
                        policy toward mainland China. While official reactions from <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss> have been restrained, and unofficial
                        reactions (from <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> and

                        raising alarm, believe <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fully aware of
                        implications of implied US denial of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        national goal of return to mainland.</p>
                    <p>3. Therefore believe we have opportunity, because ground has been prepared,
                        for somewhat franker discussion than has been customary. There are risks in
                        being too explicit about US disbelief in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        ever under any circumstances returning to mainland, but believe Secy can and
                        should be forthright in acknowledging that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> envisages possibility (perhaps remote in probability and in
                        timing) of changes in mainland regime which could cause <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to modify present policies.</p>
                    <p>4. Believe any less forthright statement would be mistake because new
                        Ambassador will need to begin discussions with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> of long-term implications for Taiwan—discussions which have

                                disappears then stability on Taiwan will be threatened, presumably
                                either by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military hotheads, or
                                by Taiwanese demands for greater political power.</item>

                    <p>7. It is possible that in spite of GRC understanding of recent US statements
                            <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> will again request US logistic
                        support for massive assault on mainland “as only means of dealing with root
                        of Vietnam problem.” Without trying to outline detailed scenario, suggest
                        Secretary should say frankly that American traditions and present day
                        opinions will not support such an action, and that US is committed instead
                        to containment of aggression while strengthening chances for peaceful
                        solutions.</p>
                    <p>8. Believe we have passed the point where offers to study “concepts" for
                        assault on mainland will be either useful or credible to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss> Charge Hopson's report on his conversation
                        with Ch'en Yi prior to departure from Peiping for Hong Kong for Chiefs of
                        Missions Conference follows:</p>
                    <p>2. After referring to full exposition on Vietnam which he gave me last year,
                        Ch'en Yi said there has been talk abroad of peaceful negotiations, the
                        convening of the Geneva Conference, etc., to discuss an end to the war. But
                        the Vietnamese (both <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SVNLF1">SVNLF</gloss>), the people most <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0356"/>concerned were against negotiations.
                        Conditions were not ripe; reason was that U.S. had no intention of
                        withdrawing from Vietnam. The Chinese Government supported this stand. The
                        U.S. had never expressed the intention of withdrawing; on the contrary the
                        Americans were expanding the war and in the final stage would escalate it to
                        China. Some people thought that events would not develop in this way but
                        China had to be prepared. Judging from their dealings with the U.S. since
                        1945, the Chinese could not assume that U.S. adventurous policy had “no"
                        limit. Nothing was unlimited, but the fact was that U.S. would not withdraw
                        from Vietnam and last stage would be U.S. escalation of war to China. He
                        hoped this estimate would be proved wrong. The facts, however, were more
                        likely to prove it correct. The U.S. was meeting difficulties in Vietnam and
                        they would meet even greater difficulties in China if they attacked.</p>
                    <p>3. There were many conditions for ending the war but the following were the
                        two principal preconditions: <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>The U.S. must immediately withdraw from Vietnam; and</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>They must recognize the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front
                                as the sole representative of the Vietnamese people.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. If these two conditions (the minimum proposed by the people on the ground)
                        were accepted, all other problems could be solved. Stopping of American
                        bombing of North Vietnam and reunification would present no problems if
                        basic conditions were met. It would also be easy to implement the Geneva
                        Agreements which stipulated that Vietnam should not take part in military
                        alliances. The <gloss target="#t_SVNLF1">SVNLF</gloss> could discuss this
                        matter with the North Vietnamese without outside interference.</p>
                    <p>5. The British Government could help by stressing these two Vietnamese
                        preconditions. The Chinese and the North Vietnamese would regard any
                        proposals divorced from these conditions as being pro-American.</p>
                    <p>6. Naturally Ch'en Yi wanted to see China's rightful seat in the United
                        Nations restored. But more important was the question of relations between
                        China and the U.S.: If Sino-American relations were improved, then the
                        question of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be solved. The
                        question now was that the Americans were not willing to stop their
                        aggression in Vietnam and no matter what “His Excellency <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>” said, they were preparing to escalate
                        that war. There were of course other outstanding Sino-American issues but if
                        there were no withdrawal from Vietnam there was no question of talking about
                        the improvement in Sino-American relations. Some people said that China was
                        not interested in acquiring her seat at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Chinese would definitely not make any concessions in a
                        matter of inherent rights. But the main question was Vietnam and the danger
                        of escalation of the war to China.</p>
                    <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0357"/>
                    <p>7. When the Americans had withdrawn from Vietnam leaving the South and the
                        North Vietnamese to settle their problems themselves, there would be hope of
                        improving Sino-US relations.</p>
                    <p>8. Ch'en Yi referred to the four points made by <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> on 10 April<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">See <ref target="#d153fn3">footnote 3, Document 153</ref>.</note> (my tel No.
                        358) and asked that these should be conveyed to the Americans as well as to
                        the Conference of British Heads of Mission. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>'s four points (“China will never start a war
                        with U.S.; what China says counts; China is prepared for escalation; if
                        Americans extend war to China there will be no boundaries to that war”) all
                        revolved around the question of Vietnam and Sino-American relations.</p>
                    <p>9. Referring to Ch'en Yi's “two preconditions,” I reminded him of the English
                        saying that “politics is the art of the possible.” I said that the Americans
                        had entered into obligations with the South Vietnamese Government which made
                        it impossible for them to withdraw from Vietnam immediately without further
                        ado. For those obligations to be fulfilled, the right conditions had to be
                        created. Moreover what was the basis for calling the <gloss target="#t_SVNLF1">SVNLF</gloss> the only legal representative of the
                        Vietnamese people? The <gloss target="#t_SVNLF1">SVNLF</gloss> might
                        represent a faction—perhaps an important faction but there was nothing legal
                        about their status. I had no doubt that if a conference were convened, ways
                        could be found of ensuring their participation or representing their point
                        of view. But there was no legal basis whatsoever for claiming that they were
                        the only legal representatives. If therefore Ch'en Yi's two preconditions
                        were rigidly applied no solution was possible.</p>
                    <p>10. Ch'en Yi said that he knew that the Americans could not accept them, but
                        he also knew that the Vietnamese would not accept any departure from them
                        either. The only course therefore was to be prepared for the worst.</p>
                    <p>11. Vietnam and Sino-American relations also figured to some extent in the
                        exchanges on Sino-British relations for a summary of which please see my
                        immediately following telegram.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your letter forwarded to me by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> on 25 April.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Dated April 15; the letter is attached but not
                            printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Your comments on Communist aggression in the Far East were of great interest.
                        In this respect, I particularly appreciated your assurance of continued
                        cooperation in countering such aggression.</p>
                    <p>Following his discussions with you in March, Assistant Secretary
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> informed me of the problems which you
                        raised.</p>
                    <p>You commented in your letter on Communist Chinese plans to attack Taiwan in
                        the immediate future by air. Our review of this threat has revealed no
                        evidence of such plans nor any significant movement of units into base areas
                        within range of Taiwan which would indicate that the Communist Chinese had
                        such an attack in mind. I know you are appreciative, however, of Admiral
                            <persName>Sharp</persName>'s recent temporary deployments of F–100 and
                        F–4 aircraft to Taiwan. These deployments again demonstrate US capability to
                        respond promptly with effective force should the need arise.</p>
                    <p>I consider very important your reference to conferences with Vice Admiral
                        Gentner and Major General <persName>Johnson</persName> on ways and means to
                        improve your air defense capabilities. This type of high-level review is
                        required periodically to assure a thorough understanding of the many
                        problems of air defense and to achieve maximum capabilities with available
                        units and equipment. In this regard, I have been informed that a Systems
                        Training Program is now being instituted in Taiwan which will realistically
                        simulate air defense situations for intensified training of air defense
                        personnel. I hope that this program will provide you with a new and more
                        effective means of evaluating and improving your air defense system.</p>
                    <p>With respect to your comments on deficiencies of your F–86F aircraft, I have
                        learned the two crashes within the past year were attributed to structural
                        failure, with the possibility that two other crashes may have been due to
                        similar causes. We are expediting production and delivery of modification
                        kits which, when installed, will insure the structural integrity of these
                        aircraft. I know that Major General <persName>Johnson</persName> and his
                        staff will <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0359"/>render every possible
                        assistance in dealing with this problem. In the meantime, we will continue
                        to implement our plans to replace the F–86F's with F–5 aircraft commensurate
                        with the availability of funds and our worldwide commitments for F–5's.</p>
                    <p>You also referred to the Military Assistance Program. The degree of US
                        concern for the security of the Republic of China and our other allies
                        facing the Communist threat is indicated by our past and current Military
                        Assistance Programs. As you are aware, your cumulative program for the
                        period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 amounts to more than $2.4 billion, making the Republic
                        of China the second largest current recipient in our total worldwide
                        program. In the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 program now
                        before the Congress, we have once again allocated approximately
                        three-fourths of the total program, which includes over fifty countries, to
                        the ten countries adjacent to the borders of Soviet Russia and Communist
                        China, where our forward strategy draws the front lines of free world
                        defense. The proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 program for the
                        Republic of China is again one of the largest.</p>
                    <p>Even within this very large current program, however, certain of the items
                        which you mentioned in the Memorandum you left with me last September,<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">Dated September 16, 1965, the memorandum is
                            attached but not printed; for <persName>Chiang</persName>'s September 22
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, see
                                <ref target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note> and which you again
                        discussed with Assistant Secretary <persName>Bundy</persName>, cannot be
                        programmed. Because of this and because of our continuing mutual concern
                        that your armed forces have adequate modern equipment, we believe that the
                        quality rather than the size of the force should be emphasized.</p>
                    <p>I was pleased to note your reaffirmation of our understanding of military
                        sales. As you know we have just sent a team to Taiwan to investigate the
                        possibilities of co-production of military vehicles. This and other possible
                        projects will represent a significant investment and should be carefully
                        evaluated in terms of effects on your overall economy.</p>
                    <p>As you have no doubt been informed, the US Congress recently authorized the
                        loan of a destroyer and destroyer escort to the Republic of China. These
                        will be included within your Military Assistance Program as funds permit. We
                        have also agreed to the sale of another <gloss target="#t_APD1">APD</gloss>
                        to replace the one which was recently lost while under tow. When these ships
                        and the recently acquired <gloss target="#t_APD1">APD</gloss>'s have been
                        reconditioned, and the latter type converted, to assure their maximum combat
                        effectiveness, the naval capabilities of the Republic of China should be
                        significantly improved.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will continue to consult freely with Vice Admiral Gent-ner and
                        Major General <persName>Johnson</persName> on matters of military concern to
                        you. I <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0360"/>can assure you that they and
                        Admiral <persName>Sharp</persName> are able spokesmen on programs that are
                        of mutual interest to our countries.</p>
                    <p>Please convey to President Chiang my personal regards and sincere best wishes
                        for every success during his new term of office.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>At no time in recent years have there occurred on Mainland China
                            developments at once so important and so clouded in obscurity as those
                                <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0361"/>of the past few months.
                            Part of what has been happening is on-stage drama, but the stage
                            managers' identities have been unclear. Their purposes have been
                            ambiguous, and the noises from the wings suggest that the most important
                            events have been occurring offstage. I have, at least, so concluded
                            since my return earlier this month to the vantage point provided by
                            Hongkong. Evidently foreign observers on the Mainland enjoy no
                            substantially better overview of events: One of them, British Charge
                            Hopson, remarked to me a week ago that it is impossible for those
                            observers now to know what is really going on in China.</p>
                        <p>It may nevertheless be worthwhile at this point to draw back from
                            reporting of daily events and speculate about what may be going on—if
                            only to identify some of the main unanswered questions and to set up
                            hypotheses and alternative explanations to be tested for subsequent
                            acceptance or discard when further facts become known. Within my post
                            there is a healthy range of opinion on which I have drawn and which
                            should facilitate further hammering-out of conclusions on the anvil of
                            argument.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>First of all, have we been observing an ideological purge, a dispute over
                            policy, or a power struggle? Almost certainly all three.</p>
                        <p>In arguing over policy or in criticizing an official's performance in a
                            Communist State, ideology provides much of the language, and ideological
                            correctness is likely to be advanced as the main yardstick. No group of
                            leaders could address the major problems China faces or contemplate the
                            setbacks it has recently suffered, without arguing over policies. Even
                            if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> leaders were all selflessly
                            devoid of individual ambition to wield power—and there is much reason to
                            think otherwise—the outcome of policy disputes and ideological arguments
                            will help decide who moves up, down, or out. It is the relative weight
                            which should be assigned each of these three aspects of the present
                            struggle which cannot be judged with any degree of accuracy.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The antagonists in the power struggle must surely have in the back of
                            their minds <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s age (now 73)
                            and the question of who will succeed him. And the shadow of this coming
                            event must lend urgency to maneuverings for position among the
                            leadership under <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>—maneuverings in which <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> may not have played a deliberate role. At the same
                            time official statements and the atmospherics both suggest to some
                            members of my staff that there may have been a serious challenge from
                            within the party to the authority of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> himself. If <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> himself unleashed the present storm, its
                            violence—before which all China seems to be bowing down as though
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> were God—suggests his
                            doing so was triggered by something of no mean importance. A May 4
                            editorial in the <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0362"/>Liberation
                            Army Journal about a “life and death struggle" against elements which
                            include “Right opportunists within the Party" may have overstated the
                            case with typical Chinese Communist hyperbole, but such circumstances as
                            recourse to an Army journal to contradict the Party's leading newspaper
                            suggest a serious struggle did indeed occur. In any case, political
                            power abhors a vacuum and there will always be those who are
                            tempted—sometimes prematurely—to seize authority from apparently failing
                            hands. That a hard-liner, ranking Politburo member and “close comrade in
                            arms" of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> like Peng Chen
                            would fall during a “cultural" purge suggests how dangerous it can be to
                            be called—as Peng was in the talk of some Chinese—the “Crown Prince"
                            while the Sovereign is still alive.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The ideological purge now being attempted in China under the current
                            “Cultural Revolution" undoubtedly is intended to be more sweeping than
                            any which has occurred in China since about 221 B.C. It was then that
                            the authoritarian first Emperor of the Ch'in Dynasty ordered the burning
                            of the Confucian books, in an effort to destroy the ideological basis of
                            Feudalism and the authority of the scholar-official class which had
                            served the Feudal Lords.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> has put it, the
                            present objective—and it represents an unrealistically big order—is “to
                            liquidate completely all old ideas, all old culture, all old customs and
                            traditions which have been created in the course of thousands of years
                            by the exploiting classes to corrupt the people.” The current cultural
                            campaign is largely directed against what might be broadly termed
                            today's class of scholar-officials, who are or are suspected of being
                            the carriers of that old culture—not only scholars and educators, but
                            also newspaper editors and other Party specialists in the field of
                            publicity and propaganda. A topmost Communist scholar like Kuo Mo-jo may
                            perhaps escape a worse fate by publicly asserting that everything he has
                            ever published was “rubbish,” but a Peking newspaper editor like Teng
                            T'o will not get off so easily for having at one point written, in
                            veiled but understandable language, that one of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s foreign policy assessments—that
                            the East wind was prevailing over the West wind—was “great empty
                            talk.”</p>
                        <p>A few isolated cases of double-talk might be passed over without
                            resulting in an ideological purge, but frequent and more explicit
                            challenges of the Party line could not. It is the official line that the
                            thinking of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>
                            provides the basis for solving all problems. “<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s thought" is undoubtedly intended
                            to serve as a gyroscope, keeping the Chinese Communist ship of state
                            away from the shoals of revisionism and on the revolutionary course he
                            has set—now and for the future after he is gone. This line has been
                            questioned too often of late, while he is still alive, to instill
                            confidence it would be generally accepted after he goes. A <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0363"/>

                            scarcely be expected to tolerate explicit challenge, and evidently he
                            has not.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We do not know to what extent <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                            is in charge of the purge, and to what extent he has felt personally
                            threatened by events leading up to it. Mr. <persName>Hopson</persName>,
                            the British Charge, reports that the atmosphere in Peking reminds him of
                            that in Moscow during the time of the doctors' plot. I would not blame
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, given his suspicious
                            and obsessive character, if he did not feel safe in Peking. In any case,
                            he appears to have stayed away from the Capital throughout the past
                            half-year. (The last two times we have heard of his whereabouts he was,
                            respectively, near Canton and probably in the vicinity of Shanghai:
                            except in political terms their climate is not all that much healthier
                            than Peking's.)</p>
                        <p>Reports of conversations held with <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> at Canton last March pre-sent the picture of a man
                            complaining that his subordinates do not tell him everything—which is
                            undoubtedly true—and in the grip of what we would regard as obsessions.
                            However, the vigor of his arguments makes it clear he has not become, as
                            one commentator had concluded, a senile vegetable. It would accordingly
                            be logical to suppose he is well able to fight back against his
                            adversaries. It is not likely that he is directing the campaign in
                            detail: that was not his habit when, a far younger man, he was directing
                            campaigns from his cave in Yenan, so it is unlikely he is doing so
                            today. It is also unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s subordinates, in carrying out operations under his
                            authority, do not utilize it in ways which serve their own interests and
                            discredit their rivals.</p>
                        <p>It is now clear that the campaign is being spear-headed by or in the name
                            of Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>.
                            Retrospectively, one is entitled to wonder whether the opening maneuvers
                            of this campaign did not begin long ago. For some time <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> has been building himself up as a
                            leading exponent of “the thought of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName>.” The abolition of military ranks and
                            distinctions of uniform, a reversion to practices of civil war days
                            which created so much speculation at the time, put the leaders of the
                            Peoples Liberation Army in position to point to themselves as exemplars
                            or pure revolutionary orthodoxy. And the extension of the commissar
                            system from the People's Liberation Army to industrial, financial, and
                            commercial sectors of the economy, with many Army veterans becoming its
                            commissars, may have inserted the influence of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> and his associates deep into the
                            citadels of the pragmatists and revisionists who had been challenging
                            Maoism as the solution of all China's problems.</p>
                        <p>It is also possible that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> may
                            have decided to back <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> as the
                            successor to his own position of Party Leader. A number two man like Liu
                            Shao-chi, who is almost <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                            age, might not provide a succession which is long enough to ensure its
                            consolidation, and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> may
                            remember the <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0364"/>fate of the one
                            really revolutionary and authoritarian Chinese Dynasty—it perished in a
                            power struggle shortly after its founder's death. Lin Piao not only has
                            more charisma than <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>: at 59 he
                            is a decade younger than the average among the full members of the
                            Politburo.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing hypothesis is open to questions based, inter alia, on
                            long-held assumptions that <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>
                            was in chronically poor health. However, these assumptions are drawn
                            into question by evidence of his intense if not generally publicized
                            activity in 1960–61, as indicated in captured documents from that
                            period. Moreover, the veterans of the long march were a tough lot: many
                            of them endured great hardships, survived serious illnesses such as
                            tuberculosis, and have lived to ripe age.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s most recent pictures
                            showed him meeting the Albanian Premier, who was in China in May, in
                            company of the triumvirate of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin
                                Piao</persName>, Teng Hsiao-ping, and <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>—not looking moribund. The ever-supple
                                <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> has been acting
                            as exponent of the Cultural Revolution and has just been entrusted with
                            an important mission abroad. Teng also was with <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> during a recent meeting with
                            Japanese Communist leaders. And <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> has retained the greater prominence into which he
                            stepped, with the publication last September of his article on “People's
                            War”; it is only he who now is being cited as having “creatively applied
                            the thought of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao
                            Tse-tung</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>All of this may help answer the question as to what men are really in
                            charge of China and the purge: it suggests that under <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> the party chairman there is a
                            triumvirate: <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>, the Head of
                            Armed Forces; Teng, the Party Secretary; and <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>, the Prime Minister. Chief of
                            State Liu Shao-Ch'i continues to perform his representational duties,
                            but his chance for succession to Party leadership may have been hurt by
                            close association with the career of P'eng Chen, Mayor of Peking and
                            only Politburo member known to have been caught so far in the purge.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>China has, within the past few years, suffered two sets of great policy
                            failures, one internal and the other external. The first, of course, was
                            the failure of the policies of the Great Leap towards rapid
                            industrialization and full-scale Communism. Defense Minister P'eng
                            Te-huai objected to them and was purged in consequence; it later failed
                            and China was so badly shaken that the third Five-Year Plan had to be
                            postponed for three years, and may still be the subject of dispute.</p>
                        <p>The second was the great series of setbacks attending initiatives in the
                            foreign field which, had they succeeded, might have diverted U.S.
                            efforts from Vietnam. (The disaster in Indonesia was the most
                            resounding: Communist China may have intended Indonesia to serve as the
                            southern arm of a great pincers on the two sides of Southeast Asia.)</p>
                        <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>The foregoing failures would undoubtedly have brought down the elected
                            regime in any parliamentary democracy. They undoubtedly raised serious
                            strains within the regime in China where, given its one-party system,
                            policy dispute would be largely contained within the Party but could
                            hardly be excluded from it.</p>
                        <p>It may be premature to say what the final result will be, in policy
                            terms, of the leadership struggle and ideologic purge which have been
                            going on. However, it appears clear that the ship of state is,
                            internally at least, on a leftward track: the pragmatists are being
                            discredited and there is published and other evidence of plans for
                            another Leap Forward.</p>
                        <p>The greatest issues in the external policy sphere evidently have
                            concerned China's confrontation with the U.S. There is reason to think
                            Mao expressed, at a meeting late last September of the Party's Central
                            Committee, the conviction the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would attack China within the next two or three years.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> professed that same
                            belief to the head of the Japanese Communist Party as recently as last
                            March. It is doubtful all within the Chinese leadership believe such an
                            attack inevitable or that efforts to avoid it should not be made: Chen
                            Yi on June 9 conveyed to British Charge Hopson the impression he did not
                            totally share <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s apparent
                            conviction. And even if the leadership were agreed that an early war
                            with us were inevitable it does not follow they would be careless about
                            precipitating it on the theory that how it comes does not greatly
                            matter. They will greatly prefer the external and internal advantages of
                            being the party to conflict which is the apparent victim of aggression.
                            This undoubtedly contributes to the apparent Chinese Communist intention
                            not to become directly embroiled with the U.S. in Vietnam provided we do
                            not precipitate such embroilment.</p>
                        <p>To most Western minds, and undoubtedly to some Chinese Communist military
                            and non-military minds as well, a conviction we will soon attack
                            China—consequent to frustration in Vietnam or out of more deliberate
                            calculations—would not be consistent with presumably reliable reports of
                            continued Chinese Communist supply of tanks and <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s to Pakistan. It might be assumed China would want not
                            only to retain its present inventory of these items but also to build it
                            to the maximum extent from current production against the day of our
                            attack. This may leave out of account two considerations: <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> may hope Pakistan would put such
                            materiel to good use for renewed operations against India—to the

                            war on China, its leaders like to warn, would not be limited.) Moreover,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s defense strategy would
                            depend primarily on the resources of manpower, space, and time rather
                            than complex weapons—he would pit China's strengths against our

                                to Foreign Nationals. According to the foreword, the study was
                                undertaken on March 8, 1965, as a result of an agreement between the
                                Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Under Secretary of State
                                for Political Affairs. The Study Group operated under the policy
                                guidance of those two officials and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Chairman. It was directed by Joseph A. Yager of the
                                Policy Planning Council and Brigadier General Stephen W. Henry,
                                    <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>. Its mission was to

                                vis-a-vis “Communist China and other potentially hostile or
                                disruptive forces in the Far East" through 1976. Before preparing
                                the Long Range Study, the Study Group prepared a Short Range Report,

                    </p>
                    <p>The essence of the problem which Communist China poses for the United States
                        may be stated very simply: The Chinese regime's objectives of regional
                        hegemony and world revolution clash with our own fundamental interests in
                        preventing domination of Asia by any single power and in developing a
                        peaceful and open world society of free nations.</p>
                    <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0367"/>
                    <p>The Chinese must overcome formidable external obstacles and serious domestic
                        deficiencies if they are ever to reach their ambitious goals. Nevertheless,
                        the weakness of most of the nations East and South of China, China's own
                        size and revolutionary dynamism, and her growing military power combine to
                        make her a major source of difficulty for us in the present period.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">B. Broad Strategic Choices for the U.S.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In seeking to cope with the problem which China poses for us, we must choose
                        among three broad national strategies; disengagement, containment and
                        showdown.</p>
                    <p>The first and last of these possible strategies possess disadvantages which
                        clearly exceed their advantages: <list>
                            <item>—In the absence of a stable, advantageous balance of power in
                                Asia—or even the prospect of such a balance in the foreseeable
                                future—disengagement would not only be a betrayal of those Asians
                                who have relied upon our support and protection, but would in fairly
                                short order ensure domination of much of Asia by a single hostile
                                power.</item>
                            <item>—Seeking an early showdown is not, given the pride and
                                intransigence of the Chinese people and their leaders, a feasible
                                means of bringing about a desired change in Chinese policy, but
                                would lead to a war which would impose on us uncertain, but probably
                                large, costs in blood, treasure and prestige for highly uncertain
                                gains.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Having excluded both extremes, we are left with a national strategy of
                        seeking concurrently to check the spread of Chinese Communist power and
                        influence and to induce moderation of Peking's current expansionist
                        policies. As will be brought out later, this strategy of containment must be
                        applied differently in the different sectors of China's periphery. In all
                        areas, however, containment is not a negative defensive strategy, but
                        requires the dynamic and imaginative application of a wide variety of
                        political, military, economic and psychological measures.</p>
                    <p>Before considering how a containment strategy should be applied, it is
                        necessary to ask how possible developments in mainland China and surrounding
                        areas may either facilitate or interfere with that strategy's success. For
                        purposes of this Abstract, we will concentrate on a main- stream projection
                        of future possibilities and ignore the contingencies which are set forth in
                        Chapters II and III.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Peking is today in the twilight of the regime's revolutionary age. How the
                        new day which will dawn after <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                        passing will differ from the one that is now fading, no one can now say, but
                        sooner or later important changes will occur.</p>
                    <p>All of the apparent contenders to succeed to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s power appear to belong to his school of hard-line,
                        doctrinaire Communism. They were all <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0368"/>steeled in the long struggle for power against overwhelming odds, followed
                        by more years of stubborn effort to remake the most populous nation on
                        earth. But even among this group of old revolutionaries, as current evidence
                        suggests, recent failures at home and abroad may have caused differences on
                        basic policy issues. Certainly the pressures for a policy reappraisal must
                        already exist and may grow after <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s death.</p>
                    <p>Outstanding among the sources of such pressures is the continued indifferent
                        performance of the economy and the prospect that its future performance will
                        be little, if any, better. Chinese economic growth is weighed down by the
                        failure of the regime thus far to solve the problem of expanding
                        agricultural output faster than population. If, as appears to be the most
                        likely of various possibilities, the agricultural sector and population both
                        grow by about two percent annually over the coming decade, the economy as a
                        whole will probably not be able to expand output by more than about 3–1/2
                        percent annually. More rapid growth would require greater support from
                        agriculture in the form of industrial raw materials, food for urban workers
                        and export earnings to pay for imports of machinery and technology.</p>
                    <p>Even the modest over-all rate of growth projected above will require the
                        recapture and investment of a substantial fraction of increases in the
                        national product. As a consequence, per capita consumption may rise very
                        little, if at all, and consumption levels in the country-side may actually
                        be forced down to permit the rise in urban consumption associated with
                        continuing industrialization. The regime may therefore be caught in a
                        vicious circle. Increased agricultural output requires greatly expanded
                        supplies of chemical fertilizers and probably also added material
                        incentives. Neither can be provided in sufficient measure at existing levels
                        of production.</p>
                    <p>This circle might be broken if industry could perform substantially better
                        despite the constraints imposed by the slow pace of agriculture. The main
                        difficulty here is in the heavy commitment of scarce engineering and
                        scientific manpower to military production programs, particularly the
                        advanced weapons program. Because military programs have top priority,
                        non-military industry suffers and the industrial sector is unable to produce
                        (or to pay for the import of) incentive goods and chemical fertilizer in the
                        quantities that would give agriculture the needed boost.</p>
                    <p>Prolonged semi-failure in the economic field cannot but have adverse effects
                        on the morale of the cadres and on the people's responsiveness to
                        exhortations for continued effort. Nevertheless, there is no reason to
                        expect a fatal weakening of the regime's well-organized system of control,
                        much less the appearance of effective organized dissidence. The new
                        generation may, as Mao fears, be lacking in revolutionary zeal, <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0369"/>but it will also probably accept conformity
                        to political orthodoxy as the inevitable condition of survival in a
                        totalitarian society.</p>
                    <p>Despite serious economic constraints and a probable decline of elan among
                        cadres at all levels, the regime should be able to carry out a limited
                        number of military programs over the next ten years. The ground forces will
                        probably remain at about their present size, but will be given more modern
                        equipment. The air force will be strengthened by domestic production of
                        substantial numbers of jet fighters, a smaller number of jet medium bombers,
                        and possibly some jet transports. The principal additions to the navy will
                        be in the form of fast patrol craft and submarines, probably including
                        several capable of firing ballistic missiles with a range of about 350
                        nautical miles.</p>
                    <p>The most significant advance over the next decade will be in the field of
                        nuclear weaponry. By the mid-1970s, Communist China may have deployed as
                        many as 60 <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s and a few <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, possibly with thermonuclear warheads.
                        The Chinese may thus possess a significant and growing regional strategic
                        capability and the beginnings of a counter-deterrent force targeted against
                        the continental United States.</p>
                    <p>In external relations, Peking will continue to avoid actions involving a high
                        risk of a direct military clash with either the U.S. or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but will probably continue to pursue
                        policies inimical to the interests of both great powers. Even after
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, the Chinese leaders may be
                        expected to continue trying to subvert the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s leadership of the international Communist movement and
                        to oppose “U.S. imperialism" on many fronts. Peking will also continue
                        efforts to expand its influence beyond its borders by a combination of means
                        emphasizing subversion, diplomatic maneuver and, when possible, support of
                        “wars of national liberation.”</p>
                    <p>However the current struggle in Vietnam comes out, Southeast Asia will
                        continue to be an attractive area for the application of Chinese tactics and
                        an area of prime Chinese interest. Chinese hostility toward India will
                        probably persist and China will attempt to divert Indian energies and
                        undermine Indian self-confidence and prestige by a combination of
                        subversion, military threats on the disputed Sino-Indian border, and
                        intrigue with India's enemy, Pakistan. Toward Japan, China will seek on the
                        one hand to disrupt the U.S.-Japan alliance by arousing Japanese fears of
                        becoming involved in a nuclear war and on the other hand to expand economic
                        relations with Japan in the interests of her own development effort.</p>

                                distant <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0370"/>areas. For the
                                purpose of this study, we assume that, well before 1976, large-scale
                                military operations will have been terminated under conditions
                                generally favorable to the U.S. but that some Communist- inspired
                                guerrilla warfare will continue. To guard against a renewal of
                                Communist military activity, a substantial U.S. combat force will
                                probably have to remain in Vietnam for some time. The Government of
                                Vietnam will have made some progress in rehabilitating the country,
                                but will not yet have forged strong ties with the masses of the
                                people and will continue to be afflicted by internal
                                factionalism.</p>
                            <p>In North Vietnam, failure of the war effort would depress the cadres
                                and undermine the regime's credit with the people. Even with Soviet
                                aid, the damage and disruptions of years of war could not be quickly
                                overcome.</p>
                            <p>After failing to take over South Vietnam by force, Communist strategy
                                in Laos might follow one of two courses. The Pathet Lao might
                                re-enter the Vientiane government and, under cover of ostensible
                                observance of the 1962 Geneva agreements, seek to take over the
                                entire country by subversion. Or, with North Vietnamese support, the
                                Pathet Lao might try to over-run non-Communist areas by military
                                means. The former alternative appears more probable, especially if
                                the Communists have good reason to fear a U.S.-supported Thai
                                counteraction to any attempt they might make militarily to move up
                                to the Mekong.</p>
                            <p>In Thailand, the problem of Communist insurgency will persist, but
                                the projected events in Vietnam would have a tonic effect and
                                confirm the Thais in the wisdom of their pro-U.S. alignment. The
                                same events would probably induce Sihanouk to move Cambodia toward a
                                more genuinely neutral position. Burma, in her self-imposed
                                isolation, will be relatively little influenced by these or any
                                other external events and will continue to be characterized by
                                economic weakness and internal dissension.</p>

                            <p>Indonesia will probably be ruled by a conservative government under
                                strong military influence. Despite the persistence of highly
                                difficult problems of economic development and political
                                fragmentation, Indonesia's prestige in the immediate area will
                                increase, facilitating Djakarta's efforts to take the lead in
                                sub-regional cooperation.</p>
                            <p>Both Malaysia and Singapore will benefit from the end of Sukarno's
                                policy of confrontation, but these two former British colonial areas
                                will face new problems of external defense as the U.K. reduces its
                                military presence there. Also, both will experience some economic
                                difficulties and both may become more subject to internal communal
                                controversy as their present leaders are succeeded by less talented
                                men.</p>
                            <p>The Philippines may experience increasing social unrest owing to the
                                failure of an opportunistic and often corrupt leadership to solve
                                the <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0371"/>country's economic
                                problems and give its youth a sense of purpose. Leftist,
                                pro-neutralist, nationalist, and anti-American sentiment will grow
                                in student and intellectual circles, but the security ties with the
                                U.S. will nevertheless be maintained.</p>
                            <p>Australia and New Zealand will continue to give us effective support
                                and to pursue polices reflecting the broad coincidence of their
                                national interests with our own.</p>

                            <p>The chances are good that over the next ten years India will remain
                                under reasonably effective nationalist, non-Communist and civilian
                                leadership. Assuming that effective measures are taken to increase
                                agricultural output and to reduce restrictions on private
                                initiative—and that large quantities of foreign economic aid
                                continue to be available—India should do a little better
                                economically than Communist China. India will probably acquire a
                                limited nuclear weapons capability within the next few years.</p>
                            <p>Pakistan should do even better economically, again assuming the
                                continued availability of substantial foreign aid, but militarily
                                Pakistan's ability to compete with India will probably deteriorate.
                                Frustration over the Kashmir issue and fear of India will encourage
                                Pakistan to continue to look to China, and possibly also to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, for support and
                                protection. Pakistan is most unlikely, however, to move into the
                                camp of either great Communist power, and it will preserve a
                                significant if diminishing relationship with the U.S. The present
                                Ayub government or a similar regime based on the Army and the
                                bureaucracy should remain in office through most of the decade.</p>

                            <p>Over the next ten years, we can expect to find ourselves dealing with
                                an increasingly strong, prosperous, confident and nationalistic
                                Japan ruled by a pro-Western conservative government.</p>
                            <p>Japan will play an increasingly important role in Asian political and
                                economic developments. Japan will move more cautiously in the
                                security field, but by the mid-1970s she may alter her defense
                                posture, become an air and naval power of regional importance and
                                possibly assume some responsibility for the defense of South Korea.
                                An independent Japanese nuclear weapons program is a serious
                                possibility during the decade.</p>
                            <p>Her security and economic relations with the U.S. will remain vitally
                                important to Japan. Termination or even renegotiation of the Mutual
                                Defense Treaty now seems unlikely. Within the next few years,
                                however, the U.S. may be confronted by a serious Japanese effort to
                                regain full administrative control over the Ryukyus.</p>
                            <p>Economic relations between Japan and mainland China will probably
                                expand greatly and Japanese recognition of Peking is likely within
                                    <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0372"/>the decade.
                                Japanese-Soviet relations should improve markedly, especially in the
                                economic sphere.</p>
                            <p>The Korean peninsula will probably remain divided at the truce line,
                                but interest in reunification may increase in both North and South
                                Korea along with a heightened sense of political and economic
                                competition between the two regimes. Both North and South Korea
                                should maintain respectable rates of economic growth, but both may
                                experience domestic political instability. The influence of Japan
                                will be felt increasingly in both North and South Korea.</p>
                            <p>On Taiwan, the death of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                    Kai-shek</persName> may bring power rivalries among the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military to the fore. A more
                                fundamental problem will be the continued Taiwanese resentment at
                                being excluded from political leadership. In time, however, a new
                                and more stable balance should be struck between Taiwanese and
                                mainlander interests, based on Taiwan's sound economy and on the
                                fact that both groups share an interest in continued stability.</p>
                            <p>Even by 1976, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will probably
                                still proclaim recovery of the mainland as its primary objective,
                                but will have tacitly acquiesced in a two-Chinas situation. Well
                                before 1976, a majority of governments will have shifted recognition
                                from Taipei to Peking and voted for Peking's admission to the United
                                Nations.</p>

                                    <p>In evaluating the remaining two strategic choices, we must

                                        practicable. Maintaining sizable U.S. armed forces on the
                                        mainland of Asia is costly, restricts our strategic mobility
                                        and can lead to friction with the host governments and
                                        peoples. At the same time, abandonment of close-in

                                        under the Asian Communist threat are again our programs of
                                        economic and military aid. In most of Asia, agricultural

                                        growth. Both should receive a high priority in our aid
                                        programs.</p>
                                    <p>The fragmentation of the area around China increases its

                                        programs and otherwise we should do what we can to promote

                    <p>Time and a more realistic assessment of the adversary's intentions and
                        capabilities may be expected to downgrade the practical importance of the
                        first fundamental difference between U.S. and Chinese interests. The second
                        difference, which concerns China's proper place in the world, may prove less
                        easy to resolve. The Chinese desire to be recognized as the equal of the
                        U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has its psychological
                        roots in China's long history during most of which China was the center and
                        guiding light of its own world.</p>
                    <p>The threat which China poses for us, however, is not that she may actually
                        achieve super-power status. Realistically appraised, China's present
                        strength and future potentialities for many decades to come are simply
                        inadequate for the international role to which her present leaders aspire.
                        The danger is that merely by striving to achieve the unattainable China may
                        seriously damage our interests in Asia or draw us into a large-scale war to
                        protect them.</p>
                    <p>China's chances of overtaking the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Western Europe in wealth and power during the present
                        century are negligible. Even in Asia, China will not bulk as large
                        proportionately ten or twenty years from now as she does today. Only in the
                        field of nuclear weapons will China's claim to great power status acquire
                        some substance, but in this respect, too, China will continue to be
                        outmatched by the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In the last quarter of the twentieth century, Japan will be the great power
                        of Asia. By the late 1970s, Japan's per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> will probably be more than ten times that of China and the
                        economic gap between the two nations will still be widening. Japan may also
                        have become a nuclear power and, if so, her greater wealth and technical
                        resources will permit her quickly to surpass China in numbers of nuclear
                        weapons and sophistication of delivery vehicles. Because of greater access
                        to foreign aid, even India may do somewhat better than China economically,
                        and she will probably acquire nuclear weapons in the relatively near
                        future.</p>
                    <p>If the above picture is even a rough approximation of the shape of things to
                        come, the gap between Chinese aspirations and Chinese capabilities must
                        become increasingly apparent to all thoughtful Chinese. In time, the
                        disparity between goals and reality should induce a fundamental reappraisal
                        and change in Chinese policy.</p>
                    <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0377"/>
                    <p>No responsible Chinese leadership can escape the task of social, political
                        and economic modernization. But given China's size, huge population,
                        cultural conservatism and limited natural resources, the question of whether
                        any leadership can succeed in this task remains open. Prolonged semi-failure
                        is almost certain to wear down both the morale of the Communist cadres and
                        the responsiveness of the Chinese people to exhortations for greater effort.
                        Material incentives as a means of stimulating economic performance may
                        become an imperative necessity. But the wherewithal for such incentives can
                        be found only by reducing the priority accorded expenditures for military
                        purposes or by seeking foreign economic assistance. A future Chinese
                        leadership may be compelled to do both.</p>
                    <p>Chinese could turn for economic assistance to either the Soviet Union or to
                        one or more non-Communist nations. Our long-term problem may well be how to
                        ensure that, as containment succeeds, China will turn toward the free world
                        rather than toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The answer may lie in two directions. On the one hand, as Chinese policy
                        moderates, we should try to draw China into activities on the broader world
                        scene where, through exposure to outside reality and successful assumption
                        of international responsibility, she might gain a degree of status and
                        respect which could substitute in part for the unattainable goals of
                        regional domination and super-power status. On the other hand, by gradually
                        shifting as circumstances permit from a military policy of close-in
                        containment to containment largely from offshore island positions, and by
                        demonstrating in other ways that we are not committed to a policy of
                        hostility or military “encirclement”, we might ease the tension between
                        China and ourselves, thereby facilitating a decision that Chinese interests
                        were better served by normalizing relations with us rather than risking
                        another betrayal at the hands of Russians. In any event, over the next
                        decade and beyond, the dealings between China, the Soviet Union, and
                        increasingly, Japan will form one of the most important sets of
                        relationships in the world, in which our own security and position in Asia
                        will be heavily involved.</p>
                    <p>We might over the very long run hope for a situation in which containment in
                        China, insofar as it remains necessary, is left largely to Japan and the
                        Soviet Union with our power and influence held in reserve to rectify any
                        imbalances which might arise. If we achieve the advantageous regional
                        balance of power which is among our major objectives in Asia, and if we draw
                        China increasingly into a cooperative relationship with ourselves and other
                        free nations, the strategy of containment will truly have succeeded.</p>

                            that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will continue strongly oppose

                        <item>It was imperative in our view for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to resolve to hold fast to its <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seat and not allow unpalatable debate or language in
                            resolutions to cause <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to walk out. I
                            understood the traditions he referred to, but there was also a Chinese

                            sense of outrage; if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would stand

                            an impulsive decision but would be an inevitable and correct one that if

                            whether the resolution also has a provision retaining the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> seat, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have to walk out. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will never even consider doing otherwise, and would
                            never agree to do otherwise. To stay in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under such circumstances would not only cause
                            disillusionment in Taiwan (both among Taiwanese and mainlanders, he

                            should not be difficult for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to adopt
                            procedural tactics, such as insisting on two-thirds important question
                            formula, so that any hostile resolution could be defeated. He said that
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believed in determination of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to hold line against <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, and that if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not waver, but demonstrates its
                            determination, then there should be no danger. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wavers, then attitude of other
                            countries would weaken, and attitude of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would also change (presumably attitude toward <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>). If an adverse resolution were to
                            pass, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would certainly withdraw.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could convey this position to
                            Canadian Government or any other government, if it wishes, since this
                            was a public stand.</item>

                        <item>This morning during course of protocol call on Secy Gen Chang Chun
                                (<gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> present, with Protocol Director
                            Shah interpreting) I said I was concerned that President might not
                            understand that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> influence on other
                            countries was limited. The days were gone when US could force others to
                            conform to US views. Situation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            therefore, was not one where simple US determination could prevail.
                            Chang said he thought <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> understood
                            this, but that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believed necessary
                            votes could still be maintained on old formula, and certainly on
                            important question, if we all worked hard and if US attitude did not
                            waver. <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> intended, he said, first to
                            make clear that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could not stay in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “voted to allow" <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> entry. Second, <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>
                            wanted to say that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believed no
                            change in tactics needed, but <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            willing to discuss tactics if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                            new ones to offer, providing new tactics in line with first point. <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0381"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> thought that important question
                            formula should suffice. I reminded Secy Gen that on two occasions last
                            fall <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organ had by simple majority vote
                            overturned requirement for two-thirds vote on matters which were clearly
                            “important questions" within meaning of Charter. We were not confident
                            that “important question" rule would hold.</item>

                            following respects: (A) he attempted rule out further discussion of new
                            tactics at his level; (B) he was seemingly adamant in insistence on
                            walking out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if any kind of “two
                            Chinas" resolution passes; (C) he professed to believe that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> holds simple key to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procedural problems if it will continue
                            strongly support traditional tactics; (D) he contended <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> needs only to use its influence with
                            countries such as Canada to get them to fall in line. These positions
                            tend to limit further discussion, and if Secy is to achieve meaningful
                            exchange of views with <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> he will
                            have to deal with them quite directly. It is still unclear whether
                                <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> really believes <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has capability to hold traditional
                            line; this could be genuine or it could be based on belief that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should make a unilateral declaration
                            that US would leave <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s voted in. In any event best
                            course is for us to hope, until convinced otherwise, that all these
                            points are tactical maneuvers that will turn out in due course to be
                            negotiable.</item>

                        <item>One topic not touched on, which Secy should consider exploring with
                                <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>, is seriously adverse
                            consequences to entire common cause if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> walks out and gates thus opened wide to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> entry. This places heavy

                        <item>I have carefully refrained from giving any hint as to nature or
                            language of any prospective new resolution. Hence I have not gone into
                            the matter of the great difference between a mere left-handed invitation
                            to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and actual entry of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Way is open for Secretary to assume that Chinese are
                            saying they will walk out if and only if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s actually appear to take <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seat. He can say that we are confident this will not
                            happen, and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s will not be able

                            remains in its seat. <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> will probably
                            try to close this off promptly by strong assertion his intention to

                            best take. Secy said neither Canada nor Italy can be depended on to
                            continue support past tactical formula and in case of Canada, likelihood

                    <p>70. 1. During a call by me on <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> July 6 he raised
                        subject of high level consultations and of Blue Lion Committee referring to
                        points conveyed to him by Charge <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> in October last year (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 396).<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See <ref target="#d108fn3">footnote 3, Document 108</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. He said he would like to broaden scope of Blue Lion Committee so that I,
                        with <gloss target="#t_TDC1">TDC</gloss> chief and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, would participate with him and a very limited number of
                        associates, in general and wide ranging discussions in very small and secure
                        group on problems of mutual interest. He indicated that these discussions
                        would probably not involve any plans for return to mainland, but would
                        include situation on mainland, <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        capabilities and intentions, Vietnam war, general Far East and world
                        strategic and political problems, etc. insofar as they affected our joint
                        interests here.</p>
                    <p>3. I said that I heartily agreed we should make occasions for such
                        discussions but that I would like a few days to think over whether Blue Lion
                        Committee was best framework. He said that of course we would have other
                        means and occasions for discussions in addition to Committee, but that he
                        was following <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposal (para B of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 396) to use Blue Lion framework.</p>
                    <p>4. It seems likely that <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> has instructed
                        him to proceed to carry out long delayed consultations and that <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss> has decided to keep to the letter of US
                        proposal, notwithstanding <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>'s
                        statement to <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> in October
                            (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 489)<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">
                            <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> that consultations would
                        not require any formal mechanism or committee. It is encouraging that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> apparently does not, at least at the
                        present time, intend to revive request for joint contingency planning for
                        attacking mainland.</p>
                    <p>5. On balance it seems advisable to follow original formula, and at least for
                        the time being accept the Blue Lion label. For one thing, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> seems to take it for granted that we should
                        use this framework as we said we would last year. For another, if these
                        talks become known to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s it would be
                        better to have them named “Blue Lion" which, if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s have capability to penetrate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military, they should know is under strictly limited ground
                        rules. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>
                        envisages <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0388"/>very informal, rather
                        personal setup, with flexible procedures, no fixed meeting dates and no set
                        agenda or agreed minutes.</p>
                    <p>6. I shall proceed, along with Adm Gentner, to explore <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ideas further and arrange a preliminary
                            meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">Telegram 4843 to Taipei, July 11,
                            reported that <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s
                            approach, especially his indication that plans for return to the
                            mainland would not be among topics for discussion, seemed to be
                            encouraging evidence the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was
                            prepared for talks that could be beneficial “both substantively and
                            psychologically.” The Department did not object to the Blue Lion label
                            for discussions but was anxious to avoid raising their visibility “from
                            Peiping viewpoint" and favored informal, flexible procedures.

                            welcomed the concept of a gray radio at first, but he found that (1) all
                            China hands with whom he was conversant were against the idea; (2) the
                            margin of benefit by “going gray" appeared very slim; and (3) <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> should be given a try at it. Mr.

                            that he could not buy the prejudices of the China experts about their
                            exclusive expertise in the field of broadcasting to China. Everything

                    <p>On July 12, 1966, President <persName>Johnson</persName> discussed U.S.
                        policy in Asia in an address to the American Alumni Council broadcast on
                        radio and television. He stated in part:</p>
                    <p>“There is a fourth essential for peace in Asia which may seem the most
                        difficult of all: reconciliation between nations that now call themselves
                        enemies.</p>
                    <p>“A peaceful mainland China is central to a peaceful Asia.</p>
                    <p>“A hostile China must be discouraged from aggression.</p>
                    <p>“A misguided China must be encouraged toward understanding of the outside
                        world and toward policies of peaceful cooperation.</p>
                    <p>“For lasting peace can never come to Asia as long as the 700 million people
                        of mainland China are isolated by their rulers from the outside world.</p>
                    <p>“We have learned in our relations with other such states that the weakness of
                        neighbors is a temptation, and only firmness that is backed by power can
                        really deter power that is backed by ambition. But we have also learned that
                        the greatest force for opening closed minds and closed societies is the free
                        flow of ideas and people and goods.” (Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                            (other than press) to President's speech on Far East was elicited by

                            Following discussion of military situation in Vietnam and related
                            subjects, President asked Ambassador about recent developments in
                            general. Ambassador took occasion to mention President's speech and to
                            reiterate that speech did not represent change in basic US China policy,
                            but that it did reflect a somewhat different approach in line with
                            essential US posture of not foreclosing possibility for settling any and
                            all differences by non-military means. If <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s should rebuff these gestures, it would be they
                            rather than we who would lose by such a confirmation of their
                            intransigence.</item>

                        <item>President <persName>Chiang</persName> said he had studied President's
                            speech closely, as had many others. He said it had created concern in
                            some circles. <persName>Chiang</persName> said he was glad to hear that
                            speech represented no basic change in policy. He would accept this and
                            not criticise speech. Excitement and unhappiness stirred up by speech in
                            some quarters around world were due to lack of understanding of
                            President <persName>Johnson</persName>'s situation.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> noted that Ambassador's assurances were
                            in line with statements by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. <persName>Chiang</persName> conjectured (without
                            any assent from Ambassador) that motivation for speech “may have been
                            largely domestic.”</item>

                            importance of US foreign relations developments (the other being <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> conviction that <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s will in any case not respond to
                            US overtures). Fact that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials
                            so far have reacted relatively mildly should not, however, be taken to
                            mean they are not deeply disturbed and that there is not an influential

                            “counterattack" against what they fear is a serious softening of US

                            long as developments occur in limited context and without immediate

                            with criticism focused chiefly on “tactical" aspects (such as effect on
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>). Given

                        <item>The Secretary responded that Taipei was now well aware that we felt
                            there was a serious tactical problem whether the important
                            question/substitution approach could succeed in the next General
                            Assembly. He noted that his trip had revealed how strongly several key
                            Asian countries feel about the issue, and particularly reported that
                            Prime Minister Sato had urged privately that we do all possible to round
                            up the votes on the present approach. The Secretary said it would be a
                            disaster if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s displaced the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, and that we needed the most careful possible review of
                            the votes to see if there was a major tactical problem in preventing
                            this result.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary went on to say that it was important to distinguish
                            between the General Assembly and the Security Council. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was named in the Charter as a Security
                            Council member, and the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> was simply
                            not the same government. (The Secretary conceded that the British and
                            perhaps others did not share this legal view.) The Secretary also
                            referred to the question whether the Asian nations would really want
                            Communist China to occupy a permanent “Asian" seat on the Security
                            Council, and whether it might not be necessary to consider a Charter
                            amendment to designate some other Asian country or to provide for a
                            method of selection for the permanent seat.</item>

                            <persName>Martin</persName> agreed on the necessity of a careful review
                            of the votes. He thought that the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>
                            decision on Southwest Africa and the Rhodesian issue—on which he saw the
                            British not being able to come up with any answer satisfactory to
                            African opinion—could have a serious effect on African voting patterns.
                            On the other hand, he noted that U Thant, in a conversation held within
                            the past 10 days, had expressed the view that there would be little
                            change from past voting patterns.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>On the basic Canadian attitude, <persName>Martin</persName> said that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> had always approached the issue
                            with full recognition of its relationship to <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0393"/>the US and of all that the issue meant to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Nonetheless, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had to recognize that there was
                            “overwhelming sentiment" developing in Canada, as shown by the 65% in a
                            recent Gallup Poll in favor of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            admission. He noted in passing that there appeared to be a similar trend
                            in the US. He said that Canada would have taken a different line before
                            now but for its concern for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            position. He then went on to say that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might not come in if offered admission, but that
                            “there may be a lot" in <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> acting to
                            make admission possible. However, the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> would never act to expel <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, although it might take or join in steps that “would
                            have the effect of ushering them out.”</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary rejoined vigorously that the issue was not one that
                            affected the vital interests of Canada; “You have a free ride on it.” On
                            the other hand, the Asian countries who face the militancy of Communist
                            China would feel great pain if she were admitted. The Secretary strongly
                            questioned whether this should be done merely to please sentiment in
                            Canada and European countries.</item>

                            in Canada and elsewhere was a fact that statesmen must take into
                            account, and the Secretary rejoined that the French particularly simply
                            had no further stake in Asia. <persName>Martin</persName> responded that

                            conversations in Ottawa in May, it seemed noteworthy that Martin did not
                            indicate that <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> planned to take some
                            “two Chinas" initiative in the near future. We have other information,

                            that Martin directed the Canadian Delegation in New York to submit
                            alternative “two Chinas" resolutions, but did not find any of these
                            acceptable. While his general remarks continue to suggest that the

                            that they will take any lead, at least for the present. Ottawa may wish
                            to comment, but our general posture should be to lie low as far as
                            direct discussions with Canadians are concerned except on voting

                    <p rend="flushleft">Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>It may be that, looking back, the crisis inside Communist China will be
                        viewed by historians as the most significant event now taking place on the
                        world scene. Obviously it is extremely hard to follow in detail.</p>
                    <p>The attached intelligence cable presents the crisis as a final stand of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and the Old Guard seeking to
                        suppress forces for change inside the Communist party. It implies that these
                        forces will, in time, assert themselves.</p>
                    <p>Something like this analysis would be accepted by most of those who have
                        followed the evolution of mainland China since 1949. What no one knows—and
                        experts argue over—is how long it will take for this strong, pragmatic
                        opposition to assert itself and what will happen in the meantime.</p>
                    <p>The latter is what matters most to us from day to day. Nevertheless, I
                        thought you might like to read this interesting assessment.</p>

                            to them at the time of its preparation. Prepared for internal use as a
                            guide to the operational environment, this commentary is disseminated in
                            the belief that it may be useful to other agencies in assessing the
                            situation for their own purposes.</p>
                        <p>Summary: Mao's opposition is widespread and continuing. It is
                            characterized by the Party as “more insidious and cunning" than any
                            previous anti-party clique. The opposition is found in artists of all
                            types, Politburo members, Party senior propagandists, military personnel
                            and university presidents. However, functional non-political offices,
                            such as Party Economic and Foreign Affairs Departments seem to be
                            outside the purge. As Mao again attempts to force his Party and his
                            people to accept the discipline of Maoism, the effort may be too much
                            for both and the Chinese may quietly walk away from his leadership.</p>
                        <p>As the purge widens throughout China there is need to examine just who
                            has been caught opposing today's Roi Soleil. It is certainly a mixed
                            bag—historians, playwrights, movie directors, Politburo members,
                            virtually all of the Party's senior propagandists, military
                            personalities and university presidents. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> have
                            recognized the universality of the opposition, indeed, have perhaps
                            created it in part. So many are involved that one wonders at first just
                            who remains loyal and who is pressing the attack against the bourgeois
                            royalists, the revisionists, and all the members of the black gang of
                            the three-family village and the four-family store.</p>
                        <p>Certain vital Communist Party entities have as yet been above reproach:
                            the public security apparatus, the Communist Party staff offices of
                            Agriculture and Forestry, Finance and Trade, Industry and
                            Communications, as well as Foreign Affairs—all appear to have escaped
                            open criticism. It almost seems that the functional non-political
                            offices are outside the purge and that those under censure are the
                            offices which are involved in the ideology of Communism and the
                            extension of Communist Party control.</p>
                        <p>The party now characterizes its opposition as “more insidious and cunning
                            than the two previous anti-party cliques which have been crushed.” These
                            are the men who “reached out to grab at power in the party, the Army,
                            and the government to usurp the leadership so as to restore capitalism.”
                            These charges are extremely serious; the problem lies in whether they
                            are genuine or false. In the past the Communists have been pretty
                            literal and we would guess that these charges should be taken seriously
                            as a clear reflection of the intentions of the opposition.</p>
                        <p>Assuming these charges are in earnest we must answer another question: To
                            whom do they specifically apply?</p>
                        <p>There has been an opposition faction in China since the Communist
                            assumption of power in 1949. After <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> embarked on the communes <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0397"/>and the Great Leap Forward and these two efforts failed
                            badly, criticism grew to a high point in 1962. From 1959 to 1962, by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s own admission, the
                            “heavy national calamities and the sabotage of the Soviet revision-ists"
                            so weakened China that a major purge to contain this criticism was not
                            possible. Actually this is partly an excuse, since <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> forced the demarche with the
                            Soviets leading to the removal of the technicians; still, there can be
                            no doubt that the Soviet departure hurt China. The intellectuals now
                            under heavy attack did use this period of party weakness to advance
                            ideas which, when read, literally refuted Maoism. This is why Wu Han and
                            Teng T'o were able to print their satires and why the party did not act
                            against them.</p>
                        <p>In late 1962 <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> felt strong
                            enough to begin the rectification he knew was necessary—the socialist
                            education campaign. This developed throughout 1963 and led to the direct
                            attack on Yang Hsien Chen, the leading theoretician of the higher party
                            school, whose dialectic arguments directly opposed those of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and were applied by the opposition
                            to buttress agreements for private plots, free markets, and increase in
                            small enterprises. All of this was anathema to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, but not necessarily to a number
                            of party leaders who were beginning to move away from <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s leadership and his theories. As
                            senior party members defied <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>,
                            many lesser individuals used this shelter to produce anti-Maoist novels,
                            essays and motion pictures.</p>
                        <p>By 1965 the rectification movement was faltering badly. The socialist
                            education movement was by then being carried forward in the nationwide
                            four clearances effort. Probably no disciplinary movement of the party
                            was so thoroughly honored in the breach as the four clearances. By the
                            fall of 1965 the party was no longer in direct control of the people.
                            The opposition within the party had continued to mature and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> found it necessary to begin a
                            broad attack on his critics in November 1965. The first battle of the
                            socialist cultural revolution took place in Shanghai when the municipal
                            committee denounced the historian Wu Han and the fight with the Peking
                            Municipal Committee began.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we can answer our question. The opposition lay in the
                            leadership of the Peking Municipal Committee, P'eng Chen and his
                            subordinates, the propaganda department of the party, which allowed the
                            development of the intellectual opposition, and the many party members
                            who felt that the relaxation of Maoist Doctrine presaged a more
                            adaptable Communism. This opposition is not dead despite the three
                            months socialist cultural revolution purge. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is attempting a cleansing of the entire country of
                            such anti-Maoist thought. He has not abandoned his intent to lead world
                            Communism, but he realizes he must fully re-establish Maoism in China
                            and regain control of the drifting party apparatus.</p>
                        <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0398"/>
                        <p>It is doubtful that a dynasty built on the sand of Maoist philosophy will
                            take a century to fall; once begun, a decade would seem too long. The
                            great socialist cultural revolution now unmasks “freaks and monsters"
                            each week. As the list of purges grows, it is a reasonable speculation
                            that there will be more. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is
                            worried about his revolution for it is clearly failing. If there is,
                            medically, a disease definable as political paranoia it has settled on
                            the sometimes resident of the small but now unlovely quarters
                            overlooking Nan Hai, Peking's most exquisite lake. “Who knows whither
                            the golden crane went, leaving but a shrine for pilgrims?" If there is
                            any answer for the old man, it is also found in Chinese poetry—"A cup of
                            wine under the trees; I drink alone for no friend is near.”</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I want you to know of a China initiative which has been under preparation for
                        some months and will soon be on its way to the Secretary of State for
                        decision. I attach an advance (and thoroughly unofficial) draft of the
                        relevant State document.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">A draft memorandum from
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and Solomon to Rusk is attached but not
                            printed.</note> (This comes to me because I am quoted in the annexes, as
                        a discussion participant.)</p>
                    <p>In brief, this memorandum recommends that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> authorize the Department to being certain small
                        modifications of our total embargo on trade and transactions with Communist
                        China which has been in effect since 1950. Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> is asked to approve (a) general
                        licensing of relevant transactions for those categories of U.S. citizens now
                        entitled to travel to <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0399"/>Communist
                        China, (b) an end to the special bunkering controls that have been in effect
                        for 16 years, and (c) preparation for unilateral relaxation of trade
                        controls (subject to the President's approval) with initial focus on two-way
                        trade in foodstuffs, non-war related pharmaceuticals, and art objects.</p>
                    <p>This recommendation to the Secretary results from the first inter-agency
                        review of the complete China trade picture since the outbreak of the Korean
                        War. To the casual observer, it may seem that the mountain has labored and
                        brought forth a mouse. Yet I anticipate resistance at the top of the
                        Department even to these minimal steps.</p>
                    <p>The rationale for modification of our trade embargo is familiar to you: In
                        the short run, despite anticipated Chinese Communist denunciation of such
                        moves, we alter a substantive element of our previously rigid and defensive
                        posture toward China, and we demonstrate to our critical friends and allies
                        a welcome degree of confidence and flexibility. In so doing, we give
                        substance and meaning to the Administration's new rhetoric—"firmness and
                        flexibility,” “containment without isolation,” “reconciliation,” etc.
                        Equally important, for the longer run, we communicate a new and supportive
                        message to elements within mainland China that are pushing for policies of
                        pragmatism and accommodation with the outside world.</p>
                    <p>I bring this matter to your attention for obvious reasons. In his July 12th
                        speech on Asia, the President went far in words toward changing our China
                        posture at the highest level. The response has been extraordinarily good,
                        both in terms of the approval his words have won, at home and abroad, and in
                        terms of the absence of strong criticism (even from Taiwan). If we are to
                        keep up the momentum of the past six months, we must begin to match out
                        words with action. There is no better place to start than the subject of
                        trade regulations which have outlived their original rationale and
                        usefulness.</p>
                    <p>As you know, however, there is certain built-in resistance to any such
                        adjustments on the 7th floor at State. We therefore face a situation in
                        which the President's declared hopes—"the free flow of ideas, people, and
                        goods"—may well be obstructed, despite hearty support for those hopes within
                        the working bureaucracy—unless the White House can deftly intervene.</p>
                    <p>I realize that there are a large number of complex political ramifications to
                        this issue—among them, the Vietnam War, the elections, the idiotic furor
                        over the German rolling mill, etc. But I would argue that as long as we are
                        standing firm in Vietnam, the President has far more benefit than risk to
                        reap in maintaining momentum on China actions as well as China rhetoric. I
                        would add that such actions could not take place at a more important moment
                        in Chinese political history: the more we can do to support the mainland
                        pragmatists by our actions and to cause confusion to the <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0400"/>theologians in Peking, the better for our
                        national interests and the achievement of stability and peace in Asia.</p>

                    <p>1126. 1. The problem of China looms large in the future of that half of the
                        world's population which lives in East and South Asia, and it casts a shadow
                        over the rest of the world as well. Before leaving Tokyo, I should like to
                        address myself to this problem as it appears from Japan, the only important
                        industrialized and modernized nation in Asia and our one great Pacific
                        partner on whom the future of our own posture in East Asia is heavily
                        dependent.</p>
                    <p>2. During the five years I have been here, I have seen bilateral
                        American-Japanese problems decrease markedly in number and intensity. Short
                        of a major depression in either country, our economic relations raise no
                        great difficulties, though some specific irritants, such as salmon
                        fisheries, remain. The determination of much of the Japanese left to break
                        the security relationship with the U.S. in 1970 has all along posed the
                        greatest threat to our bilateral relations, but the growing realism about
                        world problems on the part of the Japanese and their increasing defense
                        mindedness make it now seem improbable that this problem will of itself
                        cause serious difficulties in 1970 or thereafter. One specific aspect of the
                        defense relationship, however, does bear careful watching and a readiness
                        for rapid and flexible action on our part. This is the growing confrontation
                        in the Ryukyu Islands between Japanese nationalistic pride and U.S. and
                        Japanese defense needs. The deep emotional reaction of the Japanese in 1965
                        to U.S. actions in the Vietnamese war also shows that so <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0401"/>long as this war continues it will have
                        dangerously explosive possibilities for U.S.-Japanese relations. But the
                        Ryukyu and Vietnamese situations are themselves in part reflections of the
                        China problem. It seems safe to conclude that the continuing danger areas in
                        U.S.-Japanese relations lie not so much in our bilateral relations as in our
                        respective approaches to regional Asian problems. Among the latter the deep
                        Japanese uneasiness over the China problem, and over American policies
                        toward China presents the greatest threat.</p>
                    <p>3. The fundamental reasons for Japanese uneasiness over our China policy have
                        often been reported from this Embassy. While attitudes vary greatly among
                        age and occupational groups, the Japanese for the most part have a strong
                        sense of closeness to the Chinese, which they express in the term “same race
                        and same culture.” They look with respect and affection to China as the
                        country from which their own civilization in early days was in large part
                        derived. They feel that their geographic proximity to the Chinese giant
                        makes the maintenance of friendly relations all the more imperative from
                        them. Despite their recent great economic success, they still feel
                        uncertainties about their economic future, and, continuing to think along
                        channels well established over the past forty years, they look upon close
                        economic relations with China as necessary for their own economic well
                        being. In all these respects—racial, cultural, historical, geographic and
                        economic—they feel that the United States stands in a very different
                        position with regard to China and that, therefore, US policy is likely to
                        diverge sharply from Japan's interests. They thus picture in their mind's
                        eye a relatively small Japan which has strong reasons to be friendly to both
                        the U.S. and China but is tragically caught between the mutual antagonisms
                        between these two great giants. While more realistic Japanese would feel
                        that the Chinese are more responsible than Americans for this situation,
                        they tend to excuse the Chinese as driven by understandable psychological
                        compulsions and in any case not open to reason. On the other hand, they tend
                        to feel that the United States, as the stronger and more reasonable of the
                        two nations, should make the adjustments to ease the Sino-American tensions
                        that Japanese find so disturbing.</p>
                    <p>4. Despite these pervasive Japanese attitudes, the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, particularly under Prime Minister Sato and Foreign
                        Minister Shiina, has given us strong support on our China policy. The men
                        now in charge of the Japanese Government represent those Japanese who are
                        most fully in sympathy with the US position. A large part of their own
                        party, however, is restive about Japan's close identification with our China
                        policy, and the public at large is decidedly unhappy about it. Except for
                        the extreme left, there is general sympathy for Taiwan's “independence" of
                        continental China and its continued membership in the U.N. There is also an
                        increasing awareness of the threat inherent in Peking's dogmatism and of the
                            <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0402"/>need to discourage its open
                        aggressiveness. At the same time, the Japanese by and large believe that it
                        is only sensible to admit that two Chinas (or one China and one Taiwan) do
                        exist. They are not satisfied with a policy which ostensibly maintains that
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is the one and only representative
                        of the great historical entity known as China. They feel that Communist
                        China is here to stay for the foreseeable future and that the best outcome
                        that can be realistically hoped for is that it will in time become a less
                        cantankerous member of world society and will be satisfied to accept
                        peaceful coexistence, at least to the extent that this term is understood by
                        the Soviet Union. To hasten this process, they feel that it is important to
                        increase trade and cultural contacts with Peking and to allow Peking or even
                        encourage it to enter the U.N. (on the U.N.'s terms, of course, and not
                        Peking's). The Japanese are fearful that as things are now going an overly
                        inflexible U.S. will drift into conflict with a blindly intransigent China,
                        and Japan will be caught in the resultant catastrophe. While they welcome
                        recent efforts on our part to foster the movement of newspapermen, scholars
                        and the like between the U.S. and China, they wonder why we cannot go
                        further than this. They are unhappy about a ChiRep strategy that is clearly
                        aimed at keeping Peking out of the U.N. rather than facilitating its
                        ultimate entrance. Many of them realize that for the time being Peking no
                        doubt will refuse to enter the U.N. if Taipei is also there, but they see no
                        reason why the responsibility for Peking's absence from the U.N. should not
                        fall on Peking itself rather than on a joint U.S. and Japanese blackball
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>5. Japanese unease at being linked to a China policy which they consider is
                        basically unrealistic and not in Japan's long-range interests is, in my
                        judgment, the most serious problem that now exists in U.S.-Japanese
                        relations. It places a heavy burden on our relations, which may become
                        heavier rather than lighter the longer it lasts. Growing Japanese realism
                        about the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> menace is likely to be
                        more than offset by mounting fears of a U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> military confrontation and a rapidly rising sense of
                        national pride, which makes Japanese increasingly desirous of asserting a
                        position on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> and other China
                        policies more in line with basic Japanese feelings and less open to the
                        charge of subservience to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>6. The heavy price we pay in U.S.-Japanese relations for our current stand on
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> policy is, of course, only one
                        of many factors that must be taken into consideration in deciding on that
                        policy. I am aware of the arguments for maintaining the present position or
                        something as close to it as possible. It should be remembered, however, that
                        Japan is not the only country in which we pay a price for our present stand.
                        The cost may be higher here than elsewhere, but I believe that we pay
                        something of a price in practically every other of our major industrialized
                        allies and in many other countries throughout the world. It is also my
                        considered <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0403"/>opinion that, wholly
                        aside from the price we pay in Japan and other countries, it is to U.S.
                        interests to modify our stand on the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> issue and our whole attitude toward Peking.</p>
                    <p>7. No sensible person would deny the great threat to world peace posed by the
                        blind dogmatism of the Peking leaders and their tragic ignorance of the
                        outside world. I personally am less optimistic than some observers about the
                        rapidity with which these dangerous attitudes may change, because I feel
                        that they are not just the product of Communist dogmatism and the very
                        special and restricted experience of the Peking leaders. They are perhaps
                        more fundamentally an expression of frustration on the part of the Chinese
                        people, whose traditional pride and sense of superiority to all other
                        nations have been gravely injured by a century of continuing humiliations.
                        I, therefore, see no alternative to our present policies of firm
                        containment. It would be folly on our part and a betrayal of our own basic
                        ideals if we did not continue to give full support to the right of the
                        people who live on Taiwan to self-determination. I have throughout given
                        complete support to our policy of strong but measured military containment
                        in Vietnam and neighboring areas. I believe that we just be prepared to
                        continue to contribute to the security and stability of the Asian countries
                        that surround China, though I would hope that in the future we could find
                        ways to be not so much the primary actor in such defense as one of a group
                        of outside powers that gives the necessary support to local forces of
                        nationalism and regional efforts to maintain stability.</p>
                    <p>8. I am thus strongly in sympathy with what we are doing with regard to the
                        containment of the threat of Communist China, but I feel that the public
                        definition of our attitude towards this threat and our future relation with
                        Communist China does not contribute to the efficacy of these actions and, in
                        fact, tends to undermine them. As I see the situation, we make a pretense of
                        believing that the twelve million people on Taiwan, and not the seven
                        hundred million in continental China, represent the great historical
                        political entity known as China and that the Chinese Communist regime is not
                        here to stay, but may be swept away almost any time by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on Taiwan. We of course do not really
                        believe either proposition, and I feel that it is highly damaging to
                        ourselves and our policies that we make the pretense of doing so. It is
                        confusing to the American people, it distresses almost all our major allies,
                        including the Japanese, and it angers many of the less-developed nations,
                        who sometimes interpret our seeming scorn for Peking as a broader scorn for
                        all less developed nations. Some people may argue that these pretenses are
                        necessary to bolster up our small Asian allies in the Far East and maintain
                        morale in Taiwan. I would not deny that we would face a difficult problem,
                        particularly in Taiwan, in persuading the leaders to accommodate themselves
                        to a recognition of reality, but in the long run this will be <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0404"/>necessary in any case. In the meantime, the
                        maintenance of our pretense permits the continuation of serious economic and
                        political distortions of what would otherwise be a most encouraging
                        situation in Taiwan itself; it sometimes encourages dangerous tendencies
                        among our more committed allies, such as the Koreans; it is damaging to the
                        development of regional solidarity in Southeast Asia; and most of all it
                        stands in the way of the development in Japan, in Europe and throughout the
                        world of the sort of broad international concern for peace and stability in
                        Asia that is needed to replace the one-man policement role we are performing
                        today.</p>
                    <p>9. I believe that most people would agree that the best we can reasonably
                        hope for from Communist China in the foreseeable future is that it may
                        gradually relax its present drive for immediate world revolution and that in
                        time it will accept peaceful coexistence, at least as a temporary stratagem,
                        and will thus wish to rejoin the world on the world's terms. Most people
                        would also agree that, in order to work toward this one and only realistic
                        objective, we should not only continue to frustrate <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> expansionist drives but should also
                        help to develop greater communication and contact between Peking and the
                        outside world. Our willingness to exchange newspapermen, scholars, and the
                        like is a helpful step in this direction. The opening of trade in
                        non-strategic goods would also be useful. Since all our major allies trade
                        with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, our present trade
                        embargo is all but meaningless economically, while being psychologically
                        disadvantageous to us. More important than these concrete steps, however,
                        would be the redefinition of our attitude toward Peking. China presents us
                        with what is fundamentally a psychological problem. The leaders are of
                        course tragically misled by their own dogmatic beliefs, but even more basic
                        is Chinese pride, made all the more fierce and unbending because of the past
                        century of humiliation and the present frustrations growing out of China's
                        obvious weakness and backwardness. Nothing stands more firmly in the way of
                        a Chinese readiness to seek a rapprochement with the world than their
                        resentment of what they regard to be the callous pretense on the part of the
                        world's greatest power that China does not really exists or that, if it does
                        exist, it is so depraved or so unstable or so inconsequential that it should
                        be barred from world society. I would not claim that a more realistic and
                        more tolerant and appreciative attitude on our part would bring any quick
                        change in Chinese attitudes. I am sure that it would not. But at least it
                        would remove the greatest single barrier on our side that now stands in the
                        way of China moving in the direction we would hope to see it go, and at the
                        same time it would remove a serious barrier to the development of a broader
                        international approach to the problem of containing Chinese Communist
                        expansionism.</p>
                    <p>10. It might be argued that until China shows itself more conciliatory toward
                        the U.S., particularly at this time when we are engaged in the <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0405"/>war in Vietnam, we might lose face or might
                        weaken our containment policy if we were to redefine our attitude toward
                        Peking in this way. I would disagree strongly. I do not see how face would
                        be involved. As by far the world's greatest nation, we lose face by
                        pretending to believe things that most people in the world, including
                        ourselves, realize are not true. We lose face by letting our basic policies
                        seem to be determined by the peculiar sensitivities of a small country like
                        Taiwan. The only sound course is for us to stand frankly on our own ideals
                        and on our own judgments, and these do not include the concepts that the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will reconquer the continent or that
                        we must approve of Communist China to admit that it exists. As to a
                        redefinition of our attitude weakening the containment policy, I believe
                        that the reverse is the case. The very fact that we are militarily so
                        committed in Vietnam would prevent any serious misinterpretation of our
                        actions. On the contrary, our clarified stand would be more understandable
                        to our own people as well as to outsiders; we could count on increased
                        sympathy and possibly more actual aid from the rest of the world; we would
                        have laid the ground work for a broader international approach to the
                        continuing <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> menace; and most
                        important, by showing respect for Chinese nationalism we would help to
                        strengthen all Asian nationalism and the possibilities for increased
                        regional solidarity, which in the long run are the only real answers to the
                        threat of Communist subversion.</p>
                    <p>11. In conclusion, let me outline specifically what it is that I advocate. It
                        is merely the further clarification of the current semi-official phrase
                        “containment with [<hi rend="italic">without</hi>] isolation" and the
                        sections of the President's July 12 speech<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note> which call for a
                        “peace of conciliation" and “the full participation by all nations in an
                        international community under law.” In other words, we should make clear
                        that, however strongly we insist on the right of Taiwan to retain its
                        membership in the United Nations, we recognize that Peking represents a
                        great country which, according to the basic concepts of the U.N. and our own
                        ideals of international society, should also be represented in the U.N. and
                        other international bodies, so long as it is willing to join these on the
                        same terms that are expected of every other nation. We should also make
                        clear that we are ready to live peacefully with Peking and develop such
                        friendly cooperation as it is willing to accept; that we believe that the
                        form of government which exists in continental China is a matter for the
                        people who live there to decide; and that we have no intention of
                        interfering in any way in the domestic affairs of continental China. In
                        addition, we should find ways to express our admiration for the great
                        historic entity of China as not only the largest nation in the world today
                        in terms of population but as one of the truly great national units
                        throughout human history.</p>

                    <p>12. We have for some time been hinting at the sort of attitude I advocate,
                        but I believe that we should move to a clear and unequivocal definition of
                        this attitude as soon as possible. I realize that the delicacy of the
                        political situation on Taiwan would require carefully coordinated steps over
                        a certain period of time before the new positions could be reached. But we
                        should not allow the peculiarities of one small country to continue to
                        determine the position of the world's greatest power year after year. In
                        view of the dangers of an adverse outcome on the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> vote, in the U.N. this autumn, we need to move with
                        considerable speed. World opinion and votes in the U.N. are likely in any
                        case to push us step by step towards the type of redefinition of our
                        attitude I have outlined above. If we move in this direction only out of
                        pressing necessity and with obvious reluctance, we shall probably end up
                        with most of the disadvantages of our present stance and few of the possible
                        benefits of the new. I am convinced that it is overwhelmingly in our
                        interests to move quickly and on our initiative to the new stance, which is
                        both in keeping with the realities and with our own fundamental ideals.</p>

                    <p>(The President met with Prime Minister Pearson on the occasion of his
                        participation in a cornerstone laying ceremony at the Roosevelt Campobello
                        International Park on Campobello Island, New Brunswick. He was the luncheon
                        guest of the Prime Minister at Rossmount Inn in the little town on Chamcook,
                        N.B. The lunch was preceded by approximately an hour and a half of serious
                        conversation in a parlor of the Inn set aside for the purpose.)</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister commented that there appeared to be some real problems
                        inside Communist China. The Chinese seemed to have settled the leadership
                        question, but it appeared that the structure of the leadership is no longer
                        quite so monolithic.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the President saw any big issue coming up at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly other than the
                        Chinese representation question. He went on to say that he would like to see
                        the Chinese Communists in the United Nations where they would have to defend
                        their position before the world, but he did not want to sell out the Chinese
                        Nationalists. He concluded by asking whether public opinion on the question
                        is changing in the US.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that he thought American public opinion had moderated
                        somewhat as a result of the Fulbright hearings and the speeches of a number
                        of professors. He thought, however, that opinion could quickly swing back,
                        although he was not sure that would be good if one believes the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should include those who disagree with one's
                        position. For that matter, he said, the Chinese Communists probably don't
                        want to come in, although that may be a sham argument, and he admitted there
                        was a good deal of reason to what the Prime Minister said.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the remarks about China by saying we are still
                        examining the situation. He thought that the two governments should keep in
                        close touch on the issue and that with the relationship what it is between
                        our two countries we could always work out any differences between us.</p>

                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, in three meetings in this series in which I have
                            personally participated, I have endeavored to communicate desire of my
                            Government to see improvement in relations between our two countries. I
                            have reiterated that we have no hostile intent toward your country or
                            your people. I have conveyed wish of my Government to enlarge areas of
                            contact and communication between our two peoples so that through
                            increased knowledge may come greater understanding and possibility of
                            gradual reduction in tensions and conflicts that presently exist between
                            us. I have expressed my Government's interest in discussing problems of
                            disarmament and in pursuing specific views of your side on this subject.
                            We are under no illusion that this process would be easy or rapid one.
                            We are all too aware of great ideological and political differences
                            between our two countries. I deeply regret our inability in these
                            meetings, in part because of these differences, to pursue to a fruitful
                            conclusion any of these potential areas of agreement.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>But we are deeply convinced that violence and war are not adequate or
                            acceptable means for settling differences between states today.
                            President <persName>Johnson</persName> stated in speech July 12 that
                            “reconciliation between nations that now call themselves enemies" was
                            one of essentials for peace in Asia. He emphasized that any “isolation"
                            of your country in world comes not from actions by US or other
                            countries, but by your own choice. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>:
                            Peking has not so far commented on the President's speech. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. It is not US which blocks path toward
                            peaceful cooperation and exchange between scientists, scholars, doctors,
                            artists, and athletes of our two countries. We know there is active
                            correspondence on professional matters between many of your scientists
                            and those of US. We know of large purchases of American books and other
                            publications made by your Government in US. You are obviously interested
                            in exchange of knowledge and we understand this, because so are we. What
                            we do not understand is why you are afraid of permitting such exchanges
                            by direct, face-to-face contact? Why not openly acknowledge that such
                            direct exchanges would be of mutual benefit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> was reported by New China
                            News Agency on July 31 to have told gathering of scientists in Peking
                            that: “We are willing to learn modestly strong points and experiences of
                            people of other countries.” This is point of view we share and is reason
                            we have indicated our willingness to see such exchanges of knowledge
                            between citizens of our two countries. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: If ChiComs reject or do not reply to invitation to

                        <item>Even though your Government has so far not agreed to such exchanges as
                            we have proposed, Mr. Ambassador, I would like at this point to note
                            potential mutual benefit which would be derived from <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0410"/>exchange of plant and horticultural

                            know, exchanges of plant samples provide opportunities for
                            cross-breeding and strengthening of plant strains and thereby provide
                            basis for improving and increasing agricultural production.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, we have noted with dismay view expressed in People's
                            Daily of July 24 that “the Chinese people have always held that a
                            conference table can never bring the oppressed nations a new world of
                            independence and freedom, nor can an international agreement guarantee
                            the oppressed nations a life of liberation and happiness.” Overwhelming
                            evidence of world history in last 20 years repudiates view that peaceful
                            negotiations offers no prospect for social and political change. This
                            position is false reflection on people and governments of dozens of
                            countries in Africa and Asia: Burma, India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Malaysia,
                            the Philippines, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, Guinea, Tanzania, Kenya, and I
                            could go on and name many more. It is only when your Government realizes
                            impossibility of imposing its will and its ideology upon others through
                            force and is prepared to discuss and negotiate differences at conference
                            table that progress can be made toward goal of peace that is, I am
                            convinced, desire of Chinese people along with those of rest of world.
                            We do not consider valid political and economic premises of your
                            Government in ruling your people. But we have no intention of
                            interfering with your internal affairs. It is not for you or for us to
                            lay down rules and principles by which other governments and peoples
                            should govern themselves.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, we have repeatedly stressed that people of South
                            Vietnam should be able to decide their own future and choose their own
                            form of political, economic, and social organization, free from all
                            outside interference. Our entire position in Vietnam can be summed up as
                            an effort to assist the people of South Vietnam to achieve this goal. We
                            do not want to maintain bases in Southeast Asia and we have repeatedly
                            pledged to withdraw our troops from South Vietnam when its security and
                            freedom of choice are assured. We do not oppose the reunification of
                            Vietnam. We support the right of self-determination through the free
                            choice of the Vietnamese people. Likewise, the US does not oppose the
                            neutrality or non- alignment of all the countries of Southeast Asia if
                            that is their desire. It is in its opposition to any resolution in
                            Vietnam which is not achieved by violence and war that your Government
                            has found itself isolated from overwhelming majority of people and
                            governments in world. I am sure you are aware, Mr. Ambassador, from your
                            own reading as well as from what I and my predecessor have said in these
                            meetings, that US is absolutely resolved to continue its support of the
                            Government of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in resisting communist
                            aggression from north with its goal of imposing by force the political
                            system of North <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0411"/>Vietnam on
                            people of South Vietnam. I urge you not to doubt this and not to
                            encourage others to doubt our determination. Military success by
                            communist side in Vietnam is impossible. But we are prepared to seek
                            honorable peace, one with honor for all sides. I have indicated before
                            to you my Government's willingness to discuss means of achieving such an
                            honorable peace with representatives of your or any other government
                            directly involved. I reiterate that offer to you now. At our last
                            meeting I suggested that one means by which movement toward an end to
                            conflict could be found was through mutual dampening down of
                            hostilities. My Government would be interested in any constructive
                            proposals your side might wish to put forward. We are willing to
                            consider all propositions but we will not accept ultimata. We do not
                            attempt to intimidate others and we cannot ourselves be intimidated. I
                            assure you, Mr. Ambassador, that you have only to test our sincerity by
                            accepting our offer to discuss peaceful settlement in Vietnam. Our
                            willingness to halt destruction and slaughter of war is clear and
                            unequivocal.</item>

                        <item>Your Government, Mr. Ambassador, appears to consider that Geneva
                            Agreements no longer exist. People's Daily commentary I quoted earlier
                            alleges that Geneva Agreements have been “reduced to ashes”. It scoffs
                            at willingness of US to work toward settling conflict in Vietnam on
                            basis of Geneva Agreements and at efforts of numerous distinguished and
                            sincere international figures to achieve this end, one which authorities
                            in Hanoi claim they also seek. Mr. <persName>T'Ao Chu</persName> in a
                            speech on July 22 said that “whoever still attempts to use the Geneva
                            Agreements to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese
                            people, and the revolutionary people of the world will never succeed . .
                            . . The Geneva Agreements are already non-existent”. This is position
                            which authorities in North Vietnam have not advanced.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I would like to note that apparent position of your
                            Government on peaceful resolution of disputes (including your rejection,
                            as stated in the People's Daily of June 20, 1966 of any disarmament
                            negotiations at the present time) and statements by your Government's
                            officials setting forth extraordinary “conditions" under which your
                            Government would even consider joining <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            raise strong doubt that your Government has any interest whatsoever in
                            participating in peaceful international organizations. The very
                            foundation of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is conviction that
                            resolution of disputes and conflicts by peaceful means is not only
                            possible but necessary. On this issue every member of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is in agreement.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I regret to call your attention to unprovoked firing
                            by vessel Nan Hai 155 belonging to your country on US military aircraft
                            on July 30 at 20 degrees 37' N, 107 degrees 32' E. A second US military
                            aircraft was fired upon by armed vessels of your country's flag on
                            August 2 at 34 degrees 35' N, 123 degrees 05' E. Both incidents took
                            place on open seas and in clearly <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0412"/>international waters. US aircraft on neither occasion
                            returned fire directed at them but only this restraint and forebearance
                            in face of blatant provocation averted what could have been grave
                            incident. I strongly urge that you request your Government to take
                            appropriate measures to avoid recurrence of such incidents which could
                            lead to consequences I believe neither of us would wish.</item>

                            exhibit in War Museum in Peking. I am sure you will understand strong

                    <p>Mort Halperin told me at lunch today that a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> memorandum on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">The memorandum has not been found.</note>
                        advocating abandonment of the old formula and pointing toward a “two China"
                        policy had been approved all the way through <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, without any discernible opposition in Defense.</p>
                    <p>According to Mort, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        commissioned his staff to find some way of getting <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> into <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> policy
                        deliberations. The reasoning was that our present stand damages our
                        relations with friends, and that particularly in the case of Japan such
                        damage has defense implications.</p>
                    <p>Mort said he was talking out of school, of course, and would appreciate our
                        treating this accordingly.</p>
                    <p>As you have observed, the issue is not appropriate for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> deliberation but I wonder whether it would
                        be an appropriate Tuesday luncheon topic.</p>

                    <p>1. Prior to Red Guard excesses and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin
                            Piao</persName>'s redeclaration of global “People's War,” majority U.S.
                        opinion—public, academic, congressional and bureaucratic—seemed to hold that
                        effort should be made to bring Communist China into the world community. The
                        clear trend in international opinion was similar.</p>
                    <p>2. The effects of recent Peking extravagances on sentiment for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> invitation is not yet known, and could go
                        either way. (My Chirep memo of Aug. 31, para 6.)<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">The memorandum reported the status of the issue. (Ibid., Name File,

                    <p>3. Our ability to defeat an Albanian-type resolution (ejecting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and seating the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>) is at present questionable. A recent field round-up of
                        voting predictions produced too many “uncertains" to be very meaningful, and
                        did not take account of (a) most recent Peking belligerence, or perhaps more
                        importantly, (b) the following lament in U Thant's resignation statement:

                    <p>The two alternative drafts at Tab B<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">Both affirmed
                            that the Republic of China was a founding and continuing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member. The first requested the President
                            of the General Assembly to inquire of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> whether it was prepared to accept the obligations of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter; the second expressed

                            the Charter and its obligations.</note> may be discussed at the meeting,
                        but have not elicited much interest so far. Either of them would probably be
                        widely viewed as a too-patent gimmick, or overly moralistic.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>5. Alternative a) would be responsive to the President's desire that we get
                        off the defensive.</p>
                    <p>It would surely keep the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> out of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, for it would be interpreted by the
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s as an insult. It would
                        provoke a blast and an indignant rejection from Peking.</p>
                    <p>It would nevertheless be interpreted by many who have considered our policies
                        as too rigid, as welcome evidence of movement in those policies.</p>
                    <p>6. However, evidence is we would have difficulty in finding a suitable
                        sponsor, partly because of the lateness of the shift in our tactics, and
                        partly because many on both sides of the China issue could not support this
                        resolution. Even we presumably would have to abstain on the second part of
                        this two-part resolution, and hence on the later vote on the resolution as a
                        whole—if only because the prerequisite and exceedingly difficult ground work
                        with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has not been laid (Secretary's
                        visit to Taipei).</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, a number of our friends who have been uneasy with the “puppet"
                        tag from their support of us in the past, have asked that we give them fair
                        warning if we ever depart from our position, so that they may at least
                        precede us in that shift. It is very late to give such warning now.</p>
                    <p>7. With alternative b), we would remain on the defensive, with a policy the
                        effectiveness of which is of doubtful longevity. Although there is some
                        indication that the voting could even be slightly more favorable than last
                        year, the crucial uncertain vote (especially African) is more unpredictable
                        than ever, and we could end up with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        in and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> completely out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. There are many other considerations, but these are the more salient. There
                        is no course which is attractive and safe.</p>

                            <item>Keep constant tabs on likely voting on such a resolution. If the
                                chance of losing becomes too great, consult immediately for
                                sponsorship and support of a para 4, a) type resolution. (A last
                                minute shift in extremis would be more acceptable to our
                                friends—including the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>—than a
                                planned shift before that, at this late date.)</item>
                            <label>c.</label>
                            <item>If that alternative, too, should go awry (e.g. no appropriate
                                sponsor, too much friendly opposition, or amendment putting <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in Security Council) attempt to
                                shift immediately to a resolution establishing a study group to
                                consider this complex question, and report back to the Assembly.
                                This alternative is a poor third, since we could not predict or
                                perhaps greatly influence the outcome. It is a stop-gap if something
                                deemed worse should loom. Timing and mechanics are complex, but we
                                could probably gain support for the desired priority sequence in
                                voting, where more than one resolution is tabled.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>10. Finally, we should bear in mind that the mood on the mainland is ugly,
                        not yet fully understood, and probably not yet settled into a definitive
                        course. U Thant was not far wrong when he said China was having a nervous
                        breakdown—a malady requiring on the part of others patience and firmness,
                        understanding and wariness, flexibility, and at times forceful opposition.
                        We cannot yet predict the dominant conclusions which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership will draw from China's present
                        madness. We should therefore keep an open mind concerning resolutions which
                        may be introduced by others than the Albanian group. Especially if we are
                        otherwise in trouble, it is possible that such initiative might bring some
                        of the advantages sought in a “non-defensive" approach, without the costs
                        which would be associated with our having initiated it.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, as the situation permits, we can continue our quiet, carefully
                        measured program of attempted reconciliation. It will not be reciprocated,
                        but as a minimum it helps throw <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        and company off balance, and hopefully builds for the non-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> future.</p>

                            <persName>Wang</persName>'s opening statement focused on following
                            themes:</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>U.S.-<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> relations.
                                <persName>Wang</persName> cited U.S. hostility toward <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> since 1949. He said <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s refused be “hoodwinked" by U.S.
                            official talk of “building bridges" and improvement of <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>-U.S. relations. He attacked continued
                            U.S. occupation of Taiwan and turning Taiwan into U.S. colony and
                            military base (Secretary's visit to Taipei this summer seen as effort to
                            “hatch criminal plots" against <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>) and
                            reiterated determination of Peking to “liberate" Taiwan, and demand for
                            total U.S. withdrawal from Straits area. He called recent Seoul
                            conference of Asian States a U.S. attempt to organize a “new military
                            alliance" against <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> and charged
                            U.S.-Soviet-Japanese collusion in plotting against Peking. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and Asian people would never be
                            duped by U.S. and it clear, <persName>Wang</persName> said, there no
                            sincerity in U.S. talk of easing relations with Peking.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Vietnam. <persName>Wang</persName> referred to U.S. expansion of
                            bombing of North Vietnam, increase in force level in South, and
                            provocations against Cambodia but concluded we “foredoomed to failure.”
                            He charged U.S.-Soviet collaboration on peace initiatives and denounced
                            U.S. “peace swindles" and talks of “de-escalation.” He demanded an
                            “immediate and complete" U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and reiterated
                            references <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0418"/>to the U.S. having
                            “torn to shreds" the Geneva Accords. <persName>Wang</persName> cited Ho
                            Chi Minh's July 17 appeal at length and pledged <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> support for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He stated that China “reliable rear
                            area" for Vietnamese people, that “aggression against Vietnam is
                            aggression against China" and that U.S. would be “committing grave
                            historical blunder and will find it too late to repent" if it
                            “underestimates actions" which <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> will
                            take to support Vietnamese people. (<persName>Wang</persName> reiterated
                            this last statement verbatim again during rebuttal.)</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>In rebuttal I told <persName>Wang</persName> I would not trade threats
                            with him on Vietnam but emphasized our determination meet challenges
                            which might be presented. I emphasized U.S. willingness withdraw from
                            Vietnam when aggression halted and urged <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> to test U.S. On U.S.-<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> incidents on high seas (<persName>Wang</persName> had
                            raised both May 28 and August 29 charges of U.S. attacks on <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> ships), I reiterated our proposal
                            for joint investigations, denied May 29 charge and offered further
                            investigation of August incident if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s provided more information. I rebutted remaining
                                <persName>Wang</persName> points briefly, noting we would not
                            discuss U.S.-Soviet relations in these talks but that differing
                            U.S.-Soviet positions on Vietnam plain for all to see. Used very helpful
                                <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> and Hong Kong messages on
                            Ch'en Yi-Kosaka conversation (<persName>Wang</persName> clearly taken
                            aback and unaware of reported Ch'en Yi remarks). I noted Ch'en appeared
                            be making same points we had made in talks here and told
                                <persName>Wang</persName> I hoped <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might be willing open door to more fruitful
                            exchanges of views and relaxation of tensions. I said I was surprised at
                            contrast between Ch'en Yi's remarks and hard tone of
                                <persName>Wang</persName>'s presentation. (<persName>Wang</persName>
                            did not respond immediately but at end of meeting repeated <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> determination on Vietnam and,
                            noting this in reply to my reference to Ch'en Yi, said his statement
                            represented view of Chinese people.)</item>

                        <item>In response <persName>Wang</persName> once more went through much of
                            his opening statement argument, in abbreviated form but with few
                            variations. He asked why U.S. “haggled" over scholars and newsmen when
                            key issues such as Taiwan unresolved. He raised specific charge U.S.
                            using poison gas, claiming Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had made Sept 1965 speech justifying use of
                            such gas, and charged U.S. atrocities in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, bombing of civilians in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. He cited growing U.S. military strength despite “over
                            1000" arms control discussions to argue that U.S. talked of disarmament
                            to cover up arms expansion. He then said Peking would not participate in
                                <gloss target="#t_WDC1">WDC</gloss> or any exploratory group on
                                <gloss target="#t_WDC1">WDC</gloss> but made no reference to our
                            exchange of letters<note n="6" xml:id="d180fn6">For the U.S. letter of

                                transmitted the text of a letter rejecting the U.S. proposal, which

                        <item>I responded by reviewing usefulness of people-to-people exchanges,
                            rejected as completely false allegation on poison gas (and of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> justification), and
                            emphasized we had never intentionally struck at any nonmilitary target
                            in Vietnam. I queried why <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> unwilling
                            allow outside neutral observers (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>) inspect alleged U.S.
                            activities in North if these actually existed. I emphasized if <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aim to see U.S. troops out of
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>, they should use their influence
                            to prevail on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to halt infiltration
                            and end conflict. On disarmament, I regretted <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> rejection of exploratory group and reiterated hope
                            they at some point would recognize usefulness of genuine exchange of
                            views on arms control issues.</item>

                            <persName>Wang</persName> responded that U.S.-<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> tension due to “occupation of Taiwan,” “provocations"
                            against <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> territory, and aggression
                            against <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>'s “most intimate neighbor”.
                            By leaving these issues unsettled and haggling over side issues, U.S.
                            shows “insincerity.” U.S. should show “sincerity" by withdrawing from
                            Taiwan and halt use of force in Vietnam. He then once more went over old
                            ground on Vietnam and I decided no point in prolonging

                            noting in response my attempt move date up to December 7 or 14 that this
                            period “inconvenient" for him and that “under current circumstances,” he
                            did not think more frequent meetings were necessary. After further back
                            and forth, I agreed to Jan 11 date.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Wang then expressed strong <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            regret at U.S. violation of confidence of talks, alluding to past leaks
                            and referring to <persName>Bundy</persName>'s Feb. 12 speech to our
                            offer at 128th meeting in December on nonreciprocal admission of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> newsmen. Said Peking had decided
                            release opening <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> statement at
                            current meeting. I expressed strong regret, noting my May letter said
                            leaks were unintentional and unauthorized. I said we could not prevent
                            their releasing statement but reserved right to make whatever response
                            we believed appropriate. <persName>Wang</persName> seemed defensive,
                            anxious to show his release not unprecedented (we do not here recall
                            precedent for publication of full text of statement although partial
                            revelations have taken place before) and that U.S. really responsible

                        <item>Overall atmosphere of meeting was relaxed, even at end, and
                                <persName>Wang</persName> did not at any time appear agitated or

                            exhibited considerable surprise at my reference to Ch'en Yi-Kosaka

                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>I assume <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> opening statement
                            intended for Soviets as well as us and that this accounts, at least in
                            part, for its utter sterility. I am somewhat concerned at obvious <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> effort prolong gaps between
                            meetings longer and longer (next gap will be four months).
                                <persName>Wang</persName>'s casual remark that “in current
                            circumstances" more frequent meetings <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0420"/>not necessary was first flat indication he has given of

                            letter cited in <ref target="#d180fn6">footnote 6, Document 180</ref>.
                            It called the U.S. proposal a “sheer swindle" aimed at covering up
                            “crimes of aggression.” Telegram 43393 to Warsaw, September 8, stated
                            that its language was so abusive as to be unacceptable and instructed
                            the Embassy to return it with the oral explanation that it was
                            unacceptable because it used offensive language at variance with
                            universally accepted diplomatic norms. (Department of State, Central
                            Files, POL <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">CHICOM</gloss>-US)</note> but am
                        reluctant go to extent of formal rejection and return of their reply.
                        Virtually all our meetings with Chinese here in Warsaw and earlier in Geneva
                        have been conducted in atmosphere of polemics and invective which under any
                        normal circumstances would be grounds for U.S. representative to walk out of
                        meetings. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> opening statement in
                        meeting Sept. 7 filled with attacks and slanders against U.S. which, if made
                        to me by Polish Govt official would be totally unacceptable and grounds for
                        my instant protest.</p>
                    <p>2. We have accepted this in past, however, as one aspect of dealing with
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in this admittedly
                        extraordinary, semi-diplomatic contact. So long as general purpose of
                        contact continues useful, I am prepared to accept <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> polemics as part of the game.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> letter, it seems to me, falls
                        within same “extraordinary" character. What we would and could not accept
                        from country with which we have diplomatic relations does not and should not
                        necessarily carry over into this bizarre U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> link here.</p>

                    <p>4. I would also suggest possibility that in their strange “tit for tat"
                        approach to diplomacy if we reject their letter, <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might decide return our letter to them on Gemini shot

                            from Warsaw, September 8, reported that the Embassy had transmitted a
                            news release with a covering letter to the Chinese Embassy. It noted
                            that no discussion had ever been held with the Chinese on the question
                            of what would happen if a U.S. space flight landed for any reason in
                            Chinese Communist territory, but that the Chinese had been informed in
                            advance of each manned space shot that had overflown mainland China.
                            (Ibid., SP 1 US)</note> As you aware, they have in past accepted our
                        notifications and with this, at least moral obligation to accept
                        responsibility for return of astronauts in case of emergency. I would be
                        reluctant to risk precipitating possible rejection of our letter of
                        notification, and I have no doubt they could fabricate grounds for doing so,
                        by returning their letter on disarmament at present time.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>It is possible that the present mainland upheaval is sufficiently planned and
                        controlled so that in a couple of months Peking's affairs <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0423"/>might not prove to be significantly
                        altered, except for new faces in prominent places. However, without
                        speculating further with inadequate evidence as to just what is going on, it
                        seems just as possible that some real watershed in the Chinese scene may be
                        reached. There is something awesome in the spectacle of the oldest
                        civilization on earth methodically digging up its roots to the tune of
                        raucous, uncivilized ballyhoo and bedlam. True, this spectacle could prove
                        to be partly busy-work to cover up and to facilitate Lin's and Mao's attacks
                        on the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> party structure. In the process,
                        however, the steam has obviously built up such a head that if deadly serious
                        plans—whatever they be—should go awry, a drastic “out" might be sought.</p>
                    <p>The Asian communist people at State believe this is a time for considerable
                        caution on our part. They particularly believe we should take strict
                        measures just now against the possibility of our doing anything which might
                        be interpreted as military provocation. I am inclined to agree. The boys at
                        State are loath to put this idea into regular bureaucratic channels lest it
                        touch off delaying debate as to just what is happening on the mainland.
                        Hence if there is any merit in asking that our military and public postures
                        be cautious just now, it may be a matter which should receive treatment from
                        the top down rather than the other way around.</p>
                    <p>You may wish to consider bringing up at the Tuesday luncheon, or through
                        other channels, the possibility of temporarily restricting the more
                        provocative of our forward operations along the Chinese border and of our
                        actions against shipping in the Gulf of Tonkin, during the immediate period
                        of understandably heightened Chinese nervousness. I recognize that insistent
                        Vietnam military requirements must still be overriding. We can hope that the
                        chaos on the mainland may continue a while, and may prove to be in our
                        interest in the denouement. Meanwhile we should try not to provide a way out
                        for a Mao in trouble, should he sooner or later require a particularly
                        devilish devil.</p>

                            mainland; (B) decreased possibility for starting Vietnam peace
                            negotiations; (C) further deterioration in Sino-Soviet relations.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> stressed that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policies and actions continue to be
                            synchronized and coordinated with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would, as in the past, keep
                            firmly in mind US desires and interests. He reiterated Gimo statement to
                            Secretary that first and most urgent thing is to solve Vietnam problem,
                            and that return to mainland was secondary and longer range objective.
                            However he said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believed that now is
                            opportune time for action to topple Peiping regime. He said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would like to see US bogged down in a
                            war with the Chinese Communists, and Peiping hopes that in the end the
                            US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will come to a nuclear
                            exchange. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> did not want to see a
                            large scale war with Peiping either by the US or by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, because Peiping would have too many
                            advantages in terms of very large population and large territory in
                            which to maneuver. Only the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            possesses unique advantages capable of solving the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> problem without setting off
                            larger conflagration and without running risk of bogging down as foreign
                            invader on China mainland. Interestingly, he indicated that this should
                            be done while Gimo still holds reins of government, since in present
                            circumstances <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> possesses both
                            military and political force capable of toppling Peking. (It is not
                            entirely clear, but perfectly possible, that <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> intended the inference to be “if not used during Gimo's
                            lifetime, US may not have this weapon at its disposal later" presumably
                            because political drawing power would be diminished.)</item>

                        <item>A further reason for acting now, he said, is the grave danger, as
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> sees it, that result of dragging

                            anti-imperialist, which means anti-US; (b) anti-revisionist, which means
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; and (c) against
                            traditional Chinese culture, which means anti-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said that <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s have stated that if Cultural

                            however, hope to see establishment of pro-Soviet regime, but that
                            Chinese people would not easily acquiesce again in Communist regime,
                            particularly after recent excesses of Red Guards. He said that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should be used to advantage to ensure

                            that this was for my reference and study, and that no immediate reply
                            was expected. He hoped that we could have further discussions of these

                        <item>I expressed satisfaction with his frankness, and said I would have to
                            think over his presentation and consult Washington. I reminded him that
                            basic US policy has been not to use force against the mainland regime,
                            and said I knew of no change in this policy. I said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was not sure that regime was crumbling,
                            and that while there were obviously great convulsions occurring, Mao and
                            his chosen lieutenants were still in apparent full control. Perhaps more
                            repressive measures would be used to continue the control, and end
                            result could be a regime more formidable than before. The elements being
                            purged had been as extremely hostile to the US as are the surviving
                            elements. We assume that present leadership will continue to be hostile
                            in any event. I said there might be ways by which to capitalize on the
                            present situation but it was questionable that use of force was the
                            right way, and stated that <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> should be
                            prepared for a negative reaction from Washington.</item>

                            and that he wished to set up briefings for me to go over some of the
                            proposed contingency plans. He emphasized that the briefings would be
                            for my background information only, and that no comment or policy
                            discussion of plans would be expected from me.</item>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> took the initiative in
                        asking how our relations with Communist China were developing. I said that I
                        thought the Chinese had lost <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0429"/>their
                        minds. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed. He asked how
                        I interpreted recent <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> actions,
                        particularly the activities of the Red Guards. I said I did not know how the
                        State Department in general regarded this but that my own personal opinion
                        was that one of the greatest factors was Mao's concern that his successors
                        would not follow his policies. Also, he obviously had been concerned
                        particularly with the problem of the Chinese youth who had not participated
                        in the original revolution, and Mao probably thought their present
                        activities were both good training and a means of dedicating them to his own
                        ideas. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this agreed with
                        his own appraisal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why I thought the
                        Chinese had published their opening statement in the talks with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>. I said I thought the
                        Soviets were responsible for this. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that Pravda had not made any comment of
                        its own but had simply published what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> had said in an interview. He agreed, however, that
                        others had put an interpretation on this, indicating Chinese collusion with
                        us. He agreed that this was probably the reason for the Chinese action.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the discussion of this subject, I said I thought the action
                        of the Red Guards and other steps, particularly with respect to education,
                        would compound the Chinese Communist economic difficulties. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that their information was
                        that the Chinese had been rather careful to keep hands off their top
                        scientists, particularly their atomic scientists. I said we also had
                        information to this effect, but I thought that in the last week or two there
                        were some indications that even these people were beginning to be
                        affected.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> raised the question of Chinese representation
                        by asking when the Secretary expected the issue to come up and how he saw
                        the vote. The Secretary replied that our tabulation and those of our friends
                        show some slight improvement. He added, however, that in his opinion this
                        improvement was not very significant. This, he said, is an “important
                        question.” He went on to say that he was bothered by the cynical attitude
                        many <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members were taking toward the
                        Charter on such issues as Article 19 or the importance of Chinese
                        representation. <persName>Martin</persName> readily agreed that it was
                        “important all right,” but predicted the issue would cause us trouble.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> then inquired where Senegal stood on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>. The Secretary stated its vote seemed
                        in doubt, it might abstain. <persName>Martin</persName> explained that they
                        had had Senghor in Ottawa the day before. The impression of the man had been
                        that he was a scholar and an intellectual. <persName>Martin</persName>
                        recalled that last year Senghor had abstained. Now, according to
                            <persName>Martin</persName>, Senghor said he would vote for an
                        Albanian-type resolution “without reservation.” <persName>Martin</persName>
                        confessed: “This shook me.” The Secretary commented that this change in
                        attitude on the part of Senghor was probably due to French influence.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then invited <persName>Martin</persName> to consider what are
                        the important countries with regard to this issue. The Secretary pointed out
                        that the ten countries on the Pacific that are living under the gun of
                        Chinese Communism are all firm. He cited the strong resolution which the
                        Asian Parliamentary Union had passed on the subject.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> agreed that one had to give weight to such
                        considerations. But he went on to say that if the US were not so powerful
                        and friendly, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand would long ago have taken a
                        “positive decision.” As it is, <persName>Martin</persName> said, “we do
                        think twice. After all, I would rather be popular in Washington than in
                        Peking.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> then assured the Secretary that “we have not
                        made up our minds what we are going to do, and we shall consult first.” He
                        argued, however, that it is pretty hard not to let the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in, “provided Formosa is not thrown
                        out.” To admit the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, according to
                            <persName>Martin</persName>, “would create a wonderful atmosphere.” On
                        the other hand, “if we go through the General Assembly, and Canada stays
                        with the old decision, we lose a lot of respect in our country.”
                            <persName>Martin</persName> claimed that public sentiment in Canada was
                        “overwhelmingly" in favor of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        admission. At a later stage of the discussion, <persName>Martin</persName>
                        cited the latest Gallup Poll, which reportedly showed 59% in favor of
                        admitting Red China. The Secretary suggested that all
                            <persName>Martin</persName> needed to do vis-à-vis his own public was
                        simply to tell the Canadians how it would be with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to state that it might be possible to consider <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> admission if they did not constitute
                        the major obstacle to settling <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0432"/>the
                        Viet-Nam war. Furthermore, the Secretary made the point that if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s were to be seated in the Security
                        Council, the Security Council would be “dead”. And he speculated that if
                        they had been in the Council when the Kashmir conflict arose, this problem
                        could not have been settled the way it was. <persName>Martin</persName>
                        agreed that if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s came in, there
                        would be confusion, but he seemed prepared to take this into the bargain. He
                        stated he thought the U.S. had made a great mistake. He claimed that
                        everywhere Canada was being taunted for being “just a satellite of the
                        U.S.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then suggested that <persName>Martin</persName> look at the
                        question in terms of Canadian national interest. <persName>Martin</persName>
                        countered that “if we miss this season, we create a tragic situation for the
                        world. The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s will acquire more
                        bombs. In a few years you would not be able to do much about China. The
                        interest of mankind is involved.” <persName>Martin</persName> speculated
                        what would happen if Canada, after consultation with the U.S., were to take
                        the plunge and vote for <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> admission.
                        At first, according to <persName>Martin</persName>, there would be “hell" in
                        the country. As in 1955 under Eisenhower, some would worry about reprisals
                        by the U.S. “We would go through Gethsemane.” But after that things would
                        quiet down. “The tactical picture would not have changed one bit. But we
                        would have gotten the problem off our necks.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary made the point that this was not the time to make the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s feel their policy is right. The
                        Secretary stated that President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had prolonged the war by his statement in Phnom Penh.
                        The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s should be allowed to find out
                        that their policy is leading them into a dead end.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> countered that the same could have been said
                        about the Soviets some years ago and concluded that “if we had the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s around the table, things could not
                        be worse than they are now by having them in isolation.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reminded <persName>Martin</persName> of the Berlin crisis and
                        the Cuban crisis as far as the Soviets are concerned, and pointed out that
                        those who have diplomatic relations with Communist China don't seem to have
                        any discussion with them. <persName>Martin</persName> insisted, however,
                        that the attempt must be made “to get the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s into international society.” When the Secretary argued
                        that we should not mislead the ChiComs to think that their behavior pays
                        off, <persName>Martin</persName> objected that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s surely do not believe that to let
                        them into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could be tantamount to
                        sanctioning their system. Sooner or later, according to
                            <persName>Martin</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s will be in anyway. He concluded, therefore, that the
                        “right course politically, is to get it over with now.”
                            <persName>Martin</persName> then stated that for him the crux of the
                        matter was whether or not the issue was so important that “we can afford to
                        disagree with the U.S.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that he would weigh <persName>Martin</persName>'s
                        views more heavily if Canada had troops in Viet-Nam. As it is, the Secretary
                        stated, <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0433"/>”you have no risks.”
                            <persName>Martin</persName> replied that he was not ashamed of what
                        Canada was doing in Viet-Nam. The Secretary then assured him that he was not
                        pressuring Canada to be in Viet-Nam. After a brief dissertation by
                            <persName>Martin</persName> on the debate over recognition of Communist
                        China within the U.K. Government in 1950, the Secretary concluded the
                        conversation by urging <persName>Martin</persName> not to surprise us and
                        asked him to keep in touch.</p>

                        <item>The situation in China today is one of confusion, contradiction and
                            rapid change. The more spectacular events have been widely reported: Mao
                            has chosen a new successor, Lin Piao, re-juggled the top leadership, and
                            most important, launched an extensive purge of the party. With the
                            removal of Peng Chen and the demotion of Liu Shao-chi and Teng
                            Hsiao-ping, the men who have run the party for Mao have been forced to
                            give way to a new group. Military men, notably the old Marshals of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>, are prominent in the revised
                            Politburo. Moreover, elements of the old party machine are now also
                            under attack by the Red Guard, which has been formed primarily for this
                            purpose by Lin and Mao, and to some degree is overseen by the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It seems to us that the party cannot have been subjected to such a
                            radical upheaval merely because it had been sluggish or unresponsive to
                            Mao's orders. More likely Mao was confronted with actual open opposition
                            in party forums, leading him to conclude—possibly with good reason—that
                            he could no longer trust the party as it had been constituted and led to
                            execute his basic policies. To be sure, Mao may be simply suffering from
                            the pathological suspiciousness of a senile autocrat, yet we <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0434"/>still do not believe he would have
                            wrapped himself in the mantle of the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>
                            and unleashed the Red Guards unless he had good reason to think there
                            was some real and potent threat to his authority.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>There may have been specific policy issues which brought on the
                            crisis—such as the Vietnam war, military questions, the Sino-Soviet
                            conflict or economic problems. This cannot be demonstrated from the
                            available evidence. It is reasonable to believe, however, that the
                            manner and style of Mao's approach would generate opposition among those
                            who had to run the country's affairs, and would, by its nature, have to

                        <item>Lin Piao is still a shadowy figure. We do not know how far he is loyal
                            to Mao or how far he is pursuing an ambitious plan of his own. We are
                            inclined to believe that Mao deliberately turned to Lin as he lost
                            confidence in the party, but that the proximity of power is acting as a
                            strong stimulant in Lin. If Mao and Lin successfully purge the party and
                            replace Liu's and Teng's men with their own, then <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> will obviously have gone a long
                            way to consolidating his role of heir apparent. However, even with the
                            power and prestige of Mao behind him, and perhaps allied with the wily
                            and astute Chou En-lai, Lin's task remains difficult and dangerous. The
                            leaders of the old party machine are not without assets. They are
                            presumably working now to turn the tide against the Red Guard. The
                            forces arrayed against them are formidable—Mao, Lin, the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>—but even in defeat the former party
                            leaders could throw the nation into great confusion.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Thus a basic instability could continue for some time, possibly until
                            Mao leaves the scene and a successor regime finally consolidates its
                            control. In any case, we expect protracted and complicated maneuvers.
                            Some further turmoil at the top is likely, and sharp reversals of
                            policies cannot be ruled out.</item>

                        <item>There are indeed some few signs that reason and sanity have not
                            totally departed the Chinese scene. Despite the flood tide of harsh
                            criticism against moderates and pragmatists, the regime has not yet
                            abandoned the relatively realistic and restrained approach to economic
                            policy of recent years. As spokesman for this policy, Chou En-lai has
                            called on the Red Guards to leave the farms and factories alone; Lin
                            Piao, however, has not touched on this aspect but has called for heavier
                            blows against those within the party “who have taken the capitalist
                            road.” In attempting to curb unnecessary disruptions to the economy,
                            Peking has shown particular apprehension over potential threats to the
                            fall harvest. In view of the disappointing early harvest, there is valid
                            cause for concern. But while Mao and Lin appear to have conceded Chou
                            the need to maintain some stability in the economy, we cannot be sure
                            that Mao will not again veer in an extremist direction and launch a
                            campaign against the ideological impurities now being tacitly ignored.

                        <item>Caution is also being shown in foreign affairs, specifically on
                            Vietnam. Concentration on the enemies within has resulted in a drop in
                            press attention to Vietnam and to foreign affairs generally. China has
                            not abandoned or even eased its stand on Vietnam, but it has pushed the
                            matter to the back burner for at least the time being. Aside from some
                            heavily qualified hyperbole about the Red Guards being ready to “fight a
                            war at any time,” the current upheaval has concentrated on domestic
                            issues. We estimated recently that it was unlikely that the Chinese
                            would intervene with their own forces in the Vietnam war. And we
                            continue to believe this is the best judgment of Chinese policy. But the
                            questions of who is in charge in China and what he or they are seeking
                            to accomplish certainly bear on the matter. It would only be prudent to
                            allow for some chance that turmoil in China will produce a radical break
                            with the caution that has so far characterized Chinese policy in
                            Vietnam.</item>

                        <item>There is one further aspect of the Chinese crisis that is of great
                            interest for the US. This is the effect on Hanoi. Thus far, the North
                            Vietnamese have appeared to act as if nothing has happened in China. But
                            they must be concerned over the disruptions and uncertainties. At the
                            very least, China is increasingly exposed as a rather uncertain and
                            unstable ally, and the net result may be a loss of influence in Hanoi.
                            If so, this might improve the chances for other interested parties,
                            particularly the USSR if it was so minded, to encourage Hanoi to
                            consider a political settlement.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>As for the longer term, the present crisis cannot help but have a
                            profound effect on China. It is already apparent that Mao's permanent
                            revolution is meeting resistance. The recurrent trauma of government by
                            exhortation as a substitute for effective policies to deal with real
                            problems, is clearly taking its toll among the Chinese people. Despite a
                            widespread support for Mao's objectives of building a strong and
                            independent China, there must be growing disenchantment with his methods
                            for reaching this goal. Attempts to modernize China by following
                            doctrines coined in Mao's guerrilla days must appear increasingly
                            ridiculous. Some intellectuals and even some party leaders were aware of
                            this earlier but it has by now probably reached broader sectors of
                            opinion.</item>

                        <item>No amount of glorification of the omniscient leader will dissolve the
                            tightening constraints of the economy. Most Chinese will judge any
                            government on its ability to help them meet their basic needs of food,
                            clothing and shelter. The present regime has yet to come up with a
                            reasonable plan for feeding its over 750 million people and at the same
                            time financing an economic development program. As the growing
                            population <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0436"/>pushes against the
                            limited resources of the stagnant economy, the risk of a major economic
                            crisis will grow.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>In the face of these problems, only a pragmatic leadership seems
                            likely to make any progress at all in dealing with China's immense
                            problems. Such a leadership would also be forced to make an important
                            reassessment of the premises of Mao's foreign policy, including,
                            probably, relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If
                            we are correct in these assumptions, the long range trends are moving
                            inexorably against Mao's brand of socialism, and his desperate effort to
                            reverse the tide may actually hurry his ultimate defeat. In short, his
                            fears of “revisionism" in China are probably well grounded.</item>

                        <item>I then brought up question of Chinese representation stating that in
                            recent review US policy on this matter, I had been interested to note
                            that impact of any possible shift in US posture on US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations had received little stress.
                            I said that perhaps, in light of recent events in China and
                            extraordinary phenomenon of Red Guards, this consideration perhaps
                            should figure more importantly in our assessment adding that, in a
                            personal way, I had explored this question with friends and brought it
                            to attention of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> of Canada in recent conversation with him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> appeared taken aback
                            by my launching of <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> question,
                            and said that he could only repeat long-held SOV view that rightful
                            occupant Chinese seat in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. He inquired immediately whether stress
                            on US–SOV aspect of <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> study was
                            personal one on my part and I confirmed that it was. He also expressed
                            some surprise at my frank statement that domestic public opinion which
                            recent Gallup Poll had shown 59 percent in favor “two Chinas" policy no
                            longer important consideration in US assessment of <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> matter. I added, of course, that
                            this only one consideration anyway and decision had to be taken in
                            context world events. He then expressed in what appeared to be somewhat
                            confused manner SOV puzzlement over recent events in Communist China
                            stating that they not fully informed about them or sure of their
                            meaning. Admitted that their result was lack of satisfactory relations
                            with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> but observed that this should
                            be seen against background of common basic ideology and not assessed in
                            same way as unsatisfactory relations between states of differing
                            ideologies. (This statement made in uncharacteristically halting and
                            uncertain manner.)</item>

                                <item>Past ground rules, as understood both by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and by US officials here, have
                                    allowed <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> clear latitude to
                                    conduct unilateral “intelligence gathering operations,” but not
                                    “military raids.” October 15 operation must be considered as one
                                    kind of “military raid,” although we have not protested to
                                        <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in past borderline cases
                                    of this kind. It is useful to note that these ground rules allow
                                    short duration, small scale landing operations on mainland where
                                    objective is to abduct <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>

                        <item>First approach was from Belgian Foreign Minister Harmel yesterday to
                            Ambassador Knight stating that Belgian Government would begin
                            conversations with Canadian and Italian representatives at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to introduce proposal for study committee
                            on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> leading toward tabling
                            report at next <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. Harmel's vague
                            discussion indicated he thinking of wide terms of reference for
                            committee (including <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> seat in
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>) and tempted by idea of abstaining
                            on Albanian resolution if Belgian study committee proposal not adopted.
                            After discussion with Knight, Harmel seemed inclined to vote against
                            Albanian resolution but thought this would be easier for Belgium if
                            study committee resolution also tabled.</item>

                        <item>Second approach was from Italian Ambassador to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> in which Ambassador said he
                            instructed to bring to our attention statement made by Fanfani yesterday
                            in Parliament which hinted need for establishment of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> study group to make recommendation on
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> question. Ambassador added
                            he had impression no immediate move being contemplated by Italian
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> promised to

                            emphasized that our policy remained unchanged, and requested Italian
                            Government take no further initiative without first consulting US.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> gave numerous reasons
                            why we would have reservation about timing of any move which might be
                            interpreted by Peking as concession to its hard-line policy. Report of

                        <item>Third approach was from Canadian Ambassador who handed me letter from

                            (which I am repeating by separate telegram), stating that Canadian
                            Cabinet had decided it would “appear most appropriate" for Canada to go
                            on record in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> to effect that Canada
                            considers most equitable interim solution to be representation of both
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            adding that this separate initiative would still enable Canada to adhere
                            to previous position against Albanian resolution.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> letter notes he will be leaving Ottawa
                            for Eastern Europe and Italy beginning November 4 and does not see
                            possibility discussion with you prior his return November 16. I stressed
                            our desire for further discussion before Canadian position frozen and I
                            emphasized particular importance of timing of Canadian action mentioning
                            possibility that Canadians might better postpone such move until next
                            session of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Comment. On basis our latest nose count, we feel our prospect for
                            obtaining simple majority against Albanian resolution is precarious. We
                            particularly bothered by persistence of Chile's and Iran's willingness
                            to part ways with us on substantive resolution despite our high-level
                            representations. We have now analyzed carefully <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> voting on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>, and while we sustained our
                            position by expected margin, several countries voted contrary to firm
                            promises.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In this situation, I recommend we make additional interim rejoinders
                            to the Belgian, Italian and Canadian representatives before you return,
                            telling them not take any step pending further consultation. We, in
                            concert with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, will have

                    <p>The latest tally on probable voting is about where it was when you left town.
                        It is possible that we could have a slightly higher margin on our side than
                        last year for the important question vote. On the substantive vote, the best
                        guess is that we will have perhaps two votes margin in our favor but events
                        in Africa, mainland China, or elsewhere, could still affect this
                        considerably. Furthermore, since the vote will not come until about December
                        1 (debate begins Nov. 21), mainland events could take a somewhat clearer
                        turn with unpredictable results on the voting. The fact that the tally is
                        close to last year's vote does not indicate stability. Several nations have
                        shifted from each side of the question to the other side.</p>
                    <p>After the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> meeting today, <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Sam Berger</persName> called me into his office to say
                        that he wanted me to know of a memo being prepared as the result of a
                        meeting held this morning with Joe Sisco, but that it was being very closely
                        held within the Department.<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">A November 3
                            memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> to

                            alternatives: continuing the same tactics, supporting dual
                            representation, and supporting a Study Committee. It dismissed the first
                            alternative as ineffective and the second as unacceptable because of the
                            reaction of Taipei and other governments that were publicly committed to
                            support the U.S. position and because Congress and the public were not
                            prepared for such a sudden reversal. The memorandum stated that adoption
                            of a passive role concerning a Study Committee proposal had been
                            considered but that direct U.S. involvement would provide the best
                            assurance of getting acceptable results. A copy is attached to a

                        Italy or Belgium, to turn to a study group. We would recommend to the
                        Secretary, however, that we be a member of such a study group. (I am very
                        glad to see this change in our position.)</p>
                    <p>I think this makes sense. It may make some sort of contribution on the right
                        side of the present mainland struggle without incurring just at this
                        unpredictable time some of the risks of a more definitive change in U.S.
                        policy. I hope the Secretary will buy this policy. It is obviously essential
                            <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0444"/>that our contingency position,
                        if it becomes that, be closely held, lest it affect disastrously our initial
                        and only overt position.</p>

                        <item>Outstanding feature of my visit here was subtly cool, though correct,
                            reception by Gimo himself. Every single detail of the meeting was in
                            this direction, including transfer from residence to formal setting of
                            office, last-minute back and forth on time resulting in delay after
                            arrival, last-minute exclusion of Hummel so that Ambassador had to take
                            notes, and above all fact that conversation lasted only forty minutes
                            and was terminated politely but with unusual firmness and even
                            abruptness by Gimo. It was certainly in total contrast in warmth and
                            length with any previous conversation I have had here with Gimo over
                            many years.</item>

                            and found communiqué satisfactory, he was notably curt on declaration,
                            saying only that he “had to objection" to it. Even more significant, the
                            main message that the Gimo wished to get across was that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear-missile test<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">The Government of the People's Republic of China
                                announced on October 27 that China had successfully tested a guided

                            threaten use of these weapons specifically in Vietnam. I of course
                            responded that any such use would be a madness far beyond any
                            irrationality now discernible on the mainland, since they must be aware
                            of massive power that we could use in this event.</item>

                            relationship. He made no attempt to tie the nuclear-missile test to
                            Vietnam, and the only pitch I encountered on any of the other
                            conversations was a fairly mild plea by the Foreign Minister for
                            stepped-up mainland operations of a “commando" character.</item>

                            reconciliation themes, during the trip and specifically in the Manila
                            declaration, than others here may be. But I would be inclined to go
                            further and to suppose that <gloss target="#t_GIMO1">Gimo</gloss>'s
                            coolness reflects to some degree sense of personal affront over our

                        <item>To the extent that Gimo's reaction rests on substance, it is
                            unavoidable. However, his personal state of feeling could become
                            important if we should confront in the next month any necessity for a
                            change of position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. For what it may
                            be worth, this subject has not even been mentioned at any level in 24
                            hours of conversation here. They obviously do not want to get into any
                            suggestion of change by me, although of course I shall have to indicate
                            if asked tonight that we must and will keep situation under close

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> opened the
                        conversation by saying it seemed desirable to impose on the Under
                        Secretary's time once more in order, first, to provide the Department with
                        the draft text on which the Canadian Government has been working as a
                        possible early initiative on the question of Chinese representation in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and, secondly, to point out again that
                        Canadian Foreign Minister <persName>Martin</persName> was scheduled to
                        depart for Europe the following evening. His intent was to convey the
                        Canadian thinking on this subject to the Department in as concrete a form as
                        possible prior to Mr. <persName>Martin</persName>'s departure so that if the
                        Secretary wished to consult personally with Mr. <persName>Martin</persName>
                        he would have a more tangible basis on which to do it.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary responded that he had not yet had a chance to talk with
                        the Secretary on this subject and it was difficult for him to say just when
                        he would be able to. He pointed out that with the President leaving the next
                        day for Texas it would be difficult to go into the question in depth with
                        the Secretary prior to Mr. <persName>Martin</persName>'s departure. He
                        therefore wanted to reiterate his hope that the Canadian Government would
                        give us time to consider the matter further and an opportunity to discuss
                        both the substance of the problem and questions of timing. He noted in this
                        regard that the Secretary would also probably want to discuss the matter
                        with the President.</p>
                    <p>When the Ambassador mentioned specifically that Mr.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> would be leaving Ottawa the next day and
                        would return on November 16, the Under Secretary remarked that he assumed of
                        course that Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> would be totally out of touch
                        even during the period of his journey. <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0447"/>The Ambassador responded that one of the difficult points
                        was that the Canadian Government would obviously want to talk before
                        November 16 with other governments. He hoped therefore it would not be
                        necessary from the United States point of view that his Government refrain
                        from talking with at least some other counties. He said he was not speaking
                        of widespread consultation at this point but had in mind a few key
                        countries. (He mentioned specifically only the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.) He said he was not thinking of active lobbying by Canadian
                        representatives but certainly they would want to show the text of their
                        draft resolution to some others.</p>
                    <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0448"/>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked that the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> at
                        least give him a chance to talk to the Secretary before approaches were made
                        to any other government. He would try to do it that evening or perhaps the
                        following morning.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then turned to the substance of the Canadian proposal. He said
                        there were two purposes which his Government had in mind. The first was to
                        make it possible for the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> and other
                        governments which felt the same way to express a point of view on the
                        subject of Chinese representation which, by their so doing, would accomplish
                        the second purpose, namely to be able still to oppose an Albanian-type
                        resolution. The Canadian Government had been working for some time on a
                        draft of a resolution which would accomplish these two purposes and has come
                        up with a proposal which would call upon the President of the General
                        Assembly to carry out an investigation of the possible basis for an interim
                        solution. (The Ambassador then handed the Under Secretary the text which is
                        attached to this memorandum.)<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">The text of the
                            proposal is not attached. A copy is attached to the November 4
                            memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> cited in <ref target="#d195fn2">footnote 2, Document 195</ref>. The proposal
                            included a preamble suggesting an interim arrangement in which both
                            Chinese Governments would be seated in the General Assembly and the
                            People's Republic of China would have China's seat in the Security
                            Council, and it requested the President of the General Assembly to
                            explore the possibilities outlined in the preamble as the basis for an
                            interim solution.</note> He said the word “interim" had been chosen
                        deliberately since it was recognized that the draft dealt with the de facto
                        situation of two Chinas and did not attempt to present a long-range
                        definitive de jure solution.</p>
                    <p>After an initial glance at the text, the Under Secretary noted particularly
                        the provision for Chinese Communist representation on the Security Council.
                        He said he was of course speaking off the cuff but it certainly seemed to
                        him that this provision was hardly necessary in order to express the point
                        of view Canada was trying to get across. The Ambassador responded that his
                        Government has considered the point put did not see how the resolution would
                        be acceptable to many other governments unless such a provision were made.
                        The document, in his view, would otherwise not be a credible document.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked what the Canadians had in mind with regard to
                        tactics. Would their resolution be pressed to a vote and if so, when? after
                        consideration of the “important matter" question? after a vote on the
                        Albanian-type resolution?</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador responded that certainly they had in mind that such a
                        resolution would be put to a vote but as to timing he could not say at this
                        point. The Under Secretary stressed that tactics and substance quickly
                        become intertwined.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador remarked that the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> did not
                        expect that the Chinese Communists would welcome the Canadian resolution all
                        that warmly, but at the same time he thought the Chinese Communists would
                        not be able to maintain that the Canadian proposal was entirely
                        unreasonable. He argued that the real problem for Canada and for certain
                        other governments was how to continue to oppose an Albanian-type resolution.
                        The alternative to something like the Canadian proposal would be to abstain
                        on the Albanian resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador reaffirmed that the Canadian proposal had been drawn up only
                        after Cabinet-level consideration, although he could not be certain that the
                        Cabinet had considered the detailed wording of the draft. He asserted that
                        his Government regarded the proposal as a positive approach and as the best
                        means of preserving the real interest of Taiwan. Throughout their
                        consideration there had been a continuing effort to meet what they knew were
                        the real concerns of the United States, and he wanted to reiterate that he
                        would be available to discuss the matter at any time.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary reiterated that he would take the matter up as soon as
                        possible with the Secretary. He nevertheless wanted to say now it seemed to
                        him there were many ways of skinning a cat and that the Canadian draft was
                        not the only way of meeting the problem. There were many other courses which
                        ought to be considered. The Ambassador wryly remarked that there were indeed
                        many ways to skin a cat but a cat, after all, had only nine lives.</p>
                    <p>In parting, the Ambassador stressed again the urgency of the matter and
                        indicated his Government felt a need to begin consultation with other
                        governments very shortly. He understood the plan was to approach the British
                        the following Monday (November 7).</p>

                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>On 27 October 1966, the Chinese announced that they had successfully
                            launched a guided missile which carried a nuclear warhead. We have
                            confirmed that there was a nuclear explosion, [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] detonated in the
                            lower atmosphere about 100 miles east of the Lop Nor nuclear test site.
                            As nearly as we can ascertain, the device was delivered by a ballistic
                            missile, as the Chinese claim. Such a missile, in or near the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> class, may have been fired from the
                            Shuang-ch'eng-tzu missile test range over a distance of about 400
                            nautical miles. At this point we are not able to judge with confidence
                            what this event implies for China's advanced weapons capability. The
                            Chinese may have conducted this test for propaganda and political
                            purposes, using equipment that would not be satisfactory for a weapon
                            system. We think it somewhat more likely that they have tested a
                            missile-warhead combination which, while considerably below US or Soviet
                            standards, could be used as a weapon in the short or perhaps medium
                            range. If this is the case, the Chinese could have a few such weapons
                            ready for deployment in 1967 or 1968.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We have recently received information indicating that the Chinese also
                            have under development a much larger and more complex missile system. We
                            believe that this is an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, although
                            a space role cannot <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0450"/>be
                            discounted. We believe a launch facility will be completed early in
                            1967. No major component of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> has
                            been detected but there are indications that the Chinese might be able
                            to begin flight testing by the latter part of 1967. If so, and if they
                            are able to produce the missiles and other equipment necessary to
                            sustain an active and successful test program, a few <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, with fission nuclear warheads,
                            could be operational by the early 1970's. The first generation of such
                            missiles would probably be large, costly, and, again by US or Soviet
                            standards, deficient in reliability and accuracy. Nevertheless, the
                            Chinese would probably wish to have a few operational at least for
                            political and psychological effect. The development of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> booster would also give the Chinese
                            the capacity to put a fairly large payload into orbit early in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> test program.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>An <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> could not be fired to full
                            range within the borders of China, and we cannot establish at this time
                            how the Chinese would carry out full range <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> tests. Preliminary flight testing of system
                            components, however, could be accomplished within the borders of
                            China.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>At the same time, the Chinese will be working toward a high yield
                            thermonuclear warhead. The third Chinese test device, which contained
                            some thermonuclear material, performed quite inefficiently and
                            apparently was heavy and bulky, indicating that the Chinese have much to
                            learn about thermonuclear technology. It did, however, constitute an
                            initial step toward the attainment of a thermonuclear capability. Thus,
                            we cannot rule out the possibility that the Chinese will be able to
                            develop a thermonuclear warhead by the early 1970's.</item>

                        had some reservations but did not oppose. It was strongly supported by

                    <p>So far, reaction to each of the several stages of liberalization of travel
                        has met with very good public reception and most of us at the meeting felt
                        that this would be true of this proposed final step. There is a new
                        requirement that justification for restrictions be printed in the Federal
                        Register (Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">Not attached to the source
                            text.</note> I think we would be more likely to incur unfavorable
                        domestic reaction by failing to lift the negligible remaining restrictions,
                        since I don't believe we can make a convincing case that “travel would
                        seriously impair the conduct of United States foreign affairs.” Short of
                        that, I think the average citizen would (and should) interpret the
                        continuation of such restrictions as overly paternalistic management of
                        mature Americans. The academic community particularly is very vocally
                        critical of our present remaining restrictions—on both political and
                        “citizens' rights" considerations.</p>
                    <p>I don't think this is one the White House really needs to fight for but if
                        the issue should come up at the weekly luncheon or otherwise, I recommend
                        that you take a quietly favorable attitude toward the Working Group's

                    </p>
                    <p>The Canadian Cabinet has decided to consult with friendly governments
                        immediately on the introduction of a United Nations General Assembly
                        resolution which would ask the President of the Assembly to explore
                        possibilities of a solution based on a seat for both the Republic of China
                        and Red China in the Assembly, with the Security Council seat going to
                        Peking. The Canadians say that without this opportunity, they would be
                        obliged this year to abstain on the Albanian resolution, which provides for
                        replacing the Republic of China by Red China in all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organs. The Belgians and the Italians have also informed us
                        of their intention to make a similar new move.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian shift makes a critical difference. If we lose the support of
                        these friends, it is probable that the Albanian resolution will obtain a
                        simple majority for the first time. We could probably still prevent its
                        adoption by relying on the procedural device of requiring that such a
                        resolution receive a 2/3 majority for adoption, but we will have suffered an
                        important defeat.</p>
                    <p>I have urged <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Paul Martin</persName> not to do
                        anything further about this until I have had a chance to raise the matter
                        with you. He is proceeding with <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0453"/>consultations with a few governments (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                        Italy, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan) at once, but has agreed
                        to defer submission of his proposal formally to the General Assembly for a
                        short time pending consultations with us.</p>
                    <p>We could stand on our present tactics and oppose Canada's new move; we do not
                        believe they can be dissuaded. Canada and the Belgians have told us that
                        unless they are able to pursue a new course, they no longer will oppose the
                        Albanian resolution; others such as Italy, whose Government is under strong
                        Socialist pressure, are likely to take the same position. In these
                        circumstances, the necessary majority to prevent Red China replacing the GRC
                        would be seriously undermined.</p>
                    <p>A second option would be for us to stand aside; let the Canadians and others
                        go ahead as they see fit on the assumption the Canadian proposal probably
                        would not get the required 2/3 vote in the face of Peking's opposition. This
                        has great risks since there are elements in the Canadian proposal, e.g.
                        giving the Security Council seat to Red China, which we would not want the
                        Assembly to endorse even by a simple majority.</p>
                    <p>We conclude, therefore, we must engage the Canadians next week with the
                        safest countermeasure we can offer, i.e. establishment of a Study Committee
                        to examine all facets of the Chinese representation issue and report back to
                        the next General Assembly. There are admitted risks in pursuing this
                        suggestion since we can not be sure of the composition of the Committee and
                        more importantly, we can not guarantee what its recommendations will be. At
                        a minimum, I would expect that this Committee would recommend some form of
                        “two Chinas" solution, and that we would have to take a stand on this during
                        the Committee's work and subsequently at next year's General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>We feel strongly that the present Canadian text prejudges the ultimate
                        decision of the Assembly. I would like to make a major effort with the
                        Canadians to move them from their present course to another which we could
                        support. This would be the best protection for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The Canadians seem to have the bit in their teeth, and I
                        am not certain how far we can get with them.</p>
                    <p>A shift to a Study Committee would be a less radical departure from past
                        tactics than Canada's “one China-one Taiwan" proposal, it would be more
                        palatable to our close Asian allies, and while the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would oppose a Study Committee, it is less offensive
                        because the ultimate solution would not be prejudged. It offers some
                        flexibility on how rapidly subsequent Assemblies move towards a definite
                        substantive decision.</p>
                    <p>I would also consult quickly with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to
                        assure they understand the reasons for our efforts with the Canadians and
                        others.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mike:</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> has
                        explained to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> the
                        serious problems we have with the Canadian draft resolution on Chinese
                        representation. I hope that you will be able to give this problem your
                        personal and urgent attention.</p>
                    <p>From my conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Paul Martin</persName>
                        over a period of time, and from discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName>, I gather that your government <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0455"/>may be moved in part by the feeling
                        that an offer of membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would
                        have a constructive effect on Chinese Communist behavior, including the
                        outcome of the present internal convulsion, and also by a related feeling
                        that such an offer might have some favorable effect on the prospects for
                        peace in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I must confess that, as of this particular time at least, both of these
                        arguments seem to me to have little substance. None of us can tell where the
                        present convulsion on the mainland is headed, but surely the dominant fact
                        is that Mao and Lin Piao appear to be at least tenuously on top, and appear
                        clearly to stand for a harsh line in all aspects of policy. Our own China
                        experts are in total agreement that this is a time for watchful waiting, and
                        not for injecting any new special factor if it can be avoided. (I may say
                        that this applies equally to any military action that could be construed as
                        a direct or indirect threat to Communist China, and I can assure you of our
                        continued prudence in this regard.) As things now stand, I find it hard to
                        avoid the conclusion that at this moment what must appear to be a naked
                        offer of membership will if anything encourage the hard-liners and work
                        against the possible emergence of different policies out of the present
                        turmoil in China.</p>
                    <p>The same point applies to the prospects for peace in Vietnam. We have tried
                        our utmost to have the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> play a useful role
                        to this end, and the outcome to date suggests many factors other than the
                        absence of Peking from New York. But surely, in any event, Peking will come
                        only if the Republic of China withdraws, and in these conditions the
                        encouragement to hard-line policies, not merely immediately, but for a long
                        period to come, would only be compounded.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, there is the further imponderable of Sino-Soviet relations. Any
                        major change in the pattern of presentation of the Chinese representation
                        issue can only confront the Soviet Union with serious problems. In terms of
                        the really serious interest the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        its Eastern European friends now appear to be taking toward peace in
                        Vietnam, I doubt very much if they would feel that a new controversy on this
                        issue would be helpful.</p>
                    <p>All in all, our own conclusion would have been that it was better for this
                        year to put the issue to one side, and to deal with it on previous lines.
                        And our soundings in New York, as well as widely in Europe and elsewhere,
                        had indicated sufficient support to maintain this view, even among nations
                        most desirous of some early change in the situation.</p>
                    <p>So much for our view of the merits of the case. Having followed closely the
                        thrust of our policy over the past year, from the bombing pause in January
                        to our handling of Communist China and the theme of reconciliation stressed
                        by the President on his recent trip, I know that you recognize that our
                        motives and objectives yield to none in our concern for peace in Vietnam and
                        an eventual wider peace in Asia.</p>
                    <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0456"/>
                    <p>This brings me to the other main point that <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Paul
                            Martin</persName> has stressed in the past, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> most recently. This is that your
                        government feels under strong political pressure to show some forward
                        movement on the issue during this session, and to make clear and explicit
                        the Canadian view that a new answer must be found along “two Chinas" lines.
                        It would be presumptuous of me to contest this argument, which apparently
                        leads you to the conclusion that you must put forward and support a new
                        proposal of some sort.</p>
                    <p>But from a purely practical standpoint, I must then point out that your
                        present proposal is almost bound to create maximum mischief for minimum
                        result.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>
                            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, it is an incompatible hybrid between an
                            action and a study resolution. While ostensibly directing the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> President to explore the issue, the
                            preamble states the exact solution to be explored. Which is it meant to
                            be, for only the most naive could conclude that you have not pre-judged
                            the outcome of any exploration?</item>
                        <item>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, your resolution states the answer for
                                the Security Council as well as the General Assembly. Of course,
                                this issue will have to be faced in due course if Peking should ever
                                accept membership in the General Assembly. But surely we must all
                                recognize that a Peking seat in the Security Council raises far more
                                serious issues even than General Assembly membership; for the short
                                run, any serious student would have to conclude that Peking on the
                                Security Council would spell total ineffectiveness by the Council
                                for a long period to come on any issue such as the recent disputes
                                about Cyprus and Kashmir and a whole host of past examples in which
                                Canada has often played a great part. Must we charge across that
                                bridge in any fashion now? May we not wish to examine it at some
                                point against the possibility of some Charter amendment providing,
                                perhaps, for rotation of a permanent Asian seat on the Security
                                Council among India, Japan, and China?</p>
                            <p>I mention this point because it seems very clear that most Asian
                                nations do not welcome the thought that Peking would sit as an Asian
                                permanent member with a veto in the Security Council. Surely those
                                who live at great distance from the present scene in Asia should
                                give great weight to the views of nations most directly and deeply
                                concerned about the irrational militancy of the present Peking
                                regime.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, inclusion of the Security Council as a specific element can
                                only have the gravest effects on the reaction of the Republic of
                                China. I have always taken at face value <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Paul Martin</persName>'s assurance that your government does
                                not wish to see that government out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and I need not repeat to you the depth of our
                                convictions on this subject, convictions I believe to be shared by
                                the great majority of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                membership. Yet your proposal as it stands, by including the
                                Security Council, is bound to arouse the strongest emotions—and
                                wholly understandable ones—in <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0457"/>the Nationalist Chinese government, including the
                                moderates who represent its hopeful future voice. If you are trying
                                to force the Republic of China right out of the UN, you could not
                                choose a better course. But that can hardly be your purpose.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>Thirdly, as to the choice of a party to explore the issue, the
                            President of the General Assembly seems to us to have grave
                            disadvantages. His mandate is limited in time, and he is a single
                            individual not necessarily representative of the spectrum of views and
                            interests of the membership on a complex issue.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>All of the above are serious defects of substance. They lead us to the clear
                        conclusion that we would in any event have to oppose your Resolution in its
                        present form, if it were introduced, and indeed would have to exert every
                        ounce of our influence to defeat it by the heaviest possible margin. I need
                        not underscore the seriousness of such a split between our two nations.</p>
                    <p>But the difficulty is even more grave than this. Again from a purely
                        practical standpoint, the introduction of your Resolution could only create
                        a state of total confusion in the General Assembly as it considers the
                        Important Question issue and the Albanian Resolution. I cannot say what
                        votes you would be able to obtain for your Resolution, but at the very least
                        it would throw a last-minute and unforeseen element into the situation, so
                        that the resulting vote patterns would become the result of almost
                        unpredictable and emotional currents in New York. I cannot believe that this
                        is the constructive way to go about resolving the problem.</p>
                    <p>Let me now turn to our own affirmative proposal for a substitute resolution.
                        Although we would have preferred to let the whole issue lie for this
                        session, we have always known that the issue would have to be faced at some
                        point, and we approach the matter in a constructive spirit. The idea of a
                        study committee has a long history in the thinking of other members and in
                        our own contingency planning. Under present circumstances, it seems to us to
                        avoid virtually all the grave disadvantages of your proposal, while at the
                        same time representing clear forward movement on the issue along the line
                        that your government feels under political pressure to obtain.</p>
                    <p>This is most definitely not a delaying tactic on our part. Rather it faces
                        the whole issue head-on and will require a full report on all aspects of the
                        problem by the study committee for the next General Assembly. In the nature
                        of things, this can hardly fail to include a serious examination of the
                        complex issue of the Security Council, as well as an examination of the
                        conditions under which Peiping might be offered a General Assembly seat—a
                        matter, incidentally, on which your proposal is totally silent. In short,
                        from a substantive standpoint, it does everything you could ask and at the
                        same time provides the period of detailed examination that we <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0458"/>believe is required both in terms of the
                        complexity of the issue and in light of the present uncertainties of
                        Communist Chinese behavior.</p>
                    <p>I might add that we would wholly support membership by Canada on the study
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it is our earnest suggestion that your government not submit its
                        Resolution and take the lead with others (such as the Italians) in
                        sponsoring a proposal such as contained in the draft Resolution that we have
                        given Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">The text of the U.S. alternative draft resolution was
                            transmitted in telegram 81492, November 8. It provided that the General

                            Nations,” that “the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has attached
                            conditions to its representation,” and that “the complexities involved
                            in this question require the most searching consideration,” decided to
                            establish a committee to study all facets of the situation and make
                            recommendations to the 22d General Assembly for an equitable and

                    <p>We ourselves, while not sponsoring such a substitute proposal, would be

                        and were supported by us, you in turn would continue to support the
                        Important Question and to vote against the Albanian Resolution. With the
                        study committee resolution before the General Assembly, the latter would of
                        course become in clear contradiction to it, while I hope that your
                        government continues to appreciate the grave consequences for the whole work
                        of the United Nations that would flow from any defeat on the Important

                    <p>Finally, let me make clear that the President, who is of course now resting
                        in Texas in preparation for his operation Friday, has gone over this whole
                        matter with the greatest care and has personally approved the position I
                        have stated. We hope that your government will reconsider its position and
                        be prepared to act as I have suggested. Please let me know just as soon as
                        you possibly can.</p>

                                <persName>Bundy</persName> called in British Minister Stewart to
                            talk about Canadian proposal on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> (see <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>).
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> explained our very
                            strong objections to Canadian draft resolution, especially its
                            prejudgment of issue with drastic proposal which amounts to “one China,
                            one Taiwan" arrangement with Peking in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. He thought it would be hard to devise proposal better

                            Canadian scheme, we felt this no time for move which might encourage
                            hardline tendencies in Peking, adversely affect peace prospects in Viet
                            Nam and create problems for many allies in Asia. Our problems compounded

                            prepared, on assumption of continued Canadian opposition to Albanian
                            resolution and support for important question procedure to go along with
                            alternative arrangement of study committee to study all facets of <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">Chirep</gloss> in both <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and make
                            recommendations to next regular session of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Study committee would permit us to pursue question in
                            evolutionary and reasonable way with examination of all alternatives. It
                            would moreover provide Canadians and other governments with ample
                            opportunity to express views on substance of question.</item>

                            opposed to their resolution and suggesting this alternative. We did not
                            yet know ultimate Canadian reaction. We had also talked with Chinese,
                            Italians and would today be seeing Japanese, Australians, New Zealanders
                            and Belgians who we hoped would sympathize with our reaction.</item>

                            had already been consulted by Canadians in London and had told them
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not like Canadian resolution
                            and did not intend any policy change this year, i.e., British would
                            continue support important question procedure, would support para one of
                            Albanian resolution and would make explanation of vote on para two
                            expelling <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. British considered
                            Canadian resolution a stall which would in any event fail. Stewart added
                            quite frankly that if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were to support
                            such resolution they would expect to be thrown out of Peking. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Stewart remarked that while British had refused support Canadian
                            resolution they had agreed not to lobby against it and he assumed we
                            wished British support for our alternative. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> confirmed this and said Amb <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> would want to discuss precise
                            tactics after consultations with various governments over next few days.
                            Officer accompanying Stewart thought it necessary to remind us that when
                            the British reviewed idea of study committee in April this year they
                            frowned on idea because it would appear too much a procedural device
                            designed to avoid coming to grips with substance of issue. Stewart,
                            however, preferred not to prejudge his Government's reaction.</item>

                                confusion—i.e., number of countries such as Italy, Belgium, Chile
                                which had been on verge of shifting position before Canadian

                                carry on with traditional approach. We had great trouble with
                                Italians last year and could hardly expect Fanfani to drop study

                            <item>Situation we now face, according to Secretary, remains essentially
                                same as one month ago in that we must still sustain important
                                question procedure and defeat Albanian resolution, but in view
                                Canadian decision we now had to use counter measure to retain our
                                support for these same purposes. Actual result of study committee,
                                which designed to avoid pre-judgment of issue, would be to put off
                                decision on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">Chirep</gloss> just as we
                                have done since 1950. Secretary urged that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not draw conclusion about <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">Chirep</gloss> before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does thereby give open field to Communist China.
                                Despite annual debate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> remained

                                insistent request that US marshal other governments in all-out
                                effort to deter any Canadian initiative, refrain from supporting
                                study committee proposal, and hold to past tactics on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">Chirep</gloss> even if this course risked
                                defeat. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> argued Canadian
                                move was largely bluff which could be called by firm US response and
                                he claimed we would have adequate votes (53–48) to hold line against
                                Albanian res despite Canadians. Ambassador emphasized that if on
                                contrary US were to continue support for study committee while
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> made all out efforts

                            <item>In response Secretary explained that we did not expect <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> support for study committee but
                                simply asked that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not prejudge
                                situation by making prior assumption about outcome of such tactic.
                                Study committee might not materialize and if it did group would not
                                necessarily recommend <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                                membership in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Quite possible that
                                over next few months some move would be made to inquire about
                                Peking's attitude and if Peking refused various schemes advanced in
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Communist China would not be
                                admitted. Secretary asked why, if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could go along with study committee in 1950, it
                                could not do so today. Our problem was votes. Without some move
                                which would assure support from number of particular countries we
                                thought it very likely that Albanian resolution would achieve simple
                                majority this year and there was also serious question whether we
                                could hold support for important <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0463"/>question procedure. This was unacceptable risk for
                                US and it was for this reason that we were prepared to support study
                                committee.</item>

                                asserted we should in any case risk be willing defeat because any

                                had in fact deteriorated to point where study committee-type tactics

                                used specific examples to illustrate how Canadian initiative would
                                erode our support against Albanian resolution unless many countries
                                were offered some other alternative. They also disputed <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s insistence in assuming
                                inevitably bad consequences of study committee by showing that

                                in tactics without disastrous consequences. Ambassador's response
                                was to repeat that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had its back
                                to wall on this issue and preferred defeat to going along with

                                as advance acknowledgment of failure, making ultimate humiliation
                                that much greater. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> also
                                pointed out that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> considered any
                                switch particularly regrettable because likely impact within

                                special concern about dangers of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> militancy since we had to bear military
                                consequences in Viet-Nam. It was our judgment, however, that defeat
                                on Albanian resolution this year would be far more damaging in this
                                sense than our agreement to study committee as alternative to

                                it most useful for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to put its
                                views strongly to Canadians. We also hoped Canadians would be made
                                sharply aware of Australian, Japanese and other negative reactions.
                                Even so we had to consider our tactics in light of newly confused

                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would not retreat before
                                battle by making premature judgment about outcome of study

                            <item>In summing up Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                was opposed to any change as beginning of uncontrollable process and
                                asserted <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had to consider matter
                                in terms of its national honor and dignity since its leaders were
                                answerable to history. Secretary said he could not complain about
                                this view but could not accept it. We did not agree with
                                Ambassador's estimate of current situation in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and we strongly disagreed with his judgment about
                                effects of Canadian resolution. We would, of course, continue to
                                take account <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s views and
                                Secretary suggested that strategy group in New York resolve

                                because we had too much at stake to accept defeat on the Albanian

                                the United Nations, and noting that the People's Republic of China
                                had attached conditions to its participation in the United Nations,
                                decided to establish a committee of member states to study the
                                situation and make recommendations to the 22d General Assembly.

                            we assume only simple majority vote required. We have stated our
                            intention to support the Study Committee idea if the countries
                            interested in pressing it are thereby willing to continue to support
                            Important Question Resolution, oppose Albanian Resolution, and abandon
                            unacceptable Canadian Resolution. However, given great difficulties

                            believe it undesirable for us to get out in front on this proposal and
                            to lobby for it. We particularly welcome therefore the reluctant dragon

                        <item>Indeed, simplest outcome would be for Important Question Resolution to
                            be reaffirmed and Albanian Resolution defeated in the first instance and

                    <p>We introduced the Important Question Resolution at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this afternoon with the Belgians and others as
                        co-sponsors.</p>
                    <p>Efforts to enlist the Italians and Canadians as co-sponsors were
                        unsuccessful. The Italians wanted iron-clad assurances—we did not feel we
                        could give them—that we would not drop the study committee idea if we win
                        the votes on the Important Question and the Albanian resolutions. We are
                        trying to make sure that the order of voting in New York is: first, the
                        Important Question (to require a two-thirds vote for any change in Chinese
                        representation); second, the Albanian Resolution (to substitute Red China
                        for the Republic of China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>); and
                        third, the modified Canadian or Italian Resolution (looking toward a study
                        committee). The introduction of our Resolution today makes it likely that it
                        will be the first to be voted on. If the study committee proposal comes up,
                        we might have to go through a second Important Question vote.</p>

                    <p>At the invitation of the Secretary Mr. <persName>Kosaka</persName> reviewed
                        the impressions gained from his trip to Communist China. Mr.
                            <persName>Kosaka</persName> first explained that his trip to Communist
                        China was an effort to wrest contacts with Communist China from Japanese
                        leftwing control. Kosaka said that he had told Chen Yi he was pro-American
                        and gained more respect from Chen Yi. He also told Chinese leaders that the
                        US had no intention of bombing Communist China to which Chen Yi agreed. He
                        felt that the Chinese Communist top leadership wanted its views transmitted
                        to the US and therefore he has made his trip to Washington. Basically his
                        objective is, as a representative of the Free World, to try to make
                        Communist China open its door to the Free World.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kosaka</persName> then reviewed his major observations on
                        Communist China, as follows: <list>

                                eliminated able men, and reflects the senility of Mao.</item>

                                is no feedback of the popular views to the highest level. Mao's
                                objective is to divide his friends from his enemies, i.e. those
                                accused of being pro-American, bourgeois elements and pro-Soviet
                                revisionists.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>The success of Mao's effort depends on an increase of agricultural
                                production to meet rising population. Mao is seeking to spread his
                                cult to agricultural areas through the Red Guard movement which is
                                pushing for the abolition of private plots and reinstitution of
                                communes. However, the farmers are apathetic and Kosaka felt that
                                the abolition of private plots is not possible. He found that there
                                are only about 120 million hectares of arable land, approximately
                                one hectare per farm family. Farm income is low with a family of 5
                                to 6 earning from $208 to $416 <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0468"/>annually. In comparison industrial workers earn
                                $300 per worker annually. At the same time costs of bicycles, $50,
                                and TV sets, $200, are out of the range of farm families. Clothing
                                is available but coarse. The Chinese leadership to meet agricultural
                                discontent compares farm living stand-ards today with those of 17
                                years ago rather than with those of other comparable areas in the
                                Free World at the present time.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>Generally, Chinese people have enough to eat, more schooling and
                                free medical care which is an improvement over the pre-Communist
                                period.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>Chinese leadership claims that agricultural production will
                                increase this year and has offered to export cotton and rice to
                                Japan. Kosaka mentioned that there is a discrepancy between Hong
                                Kong estimates of Chinese Communist agricultural production of 175
                                million tons and Communist China's estimates of 200 million tons.
                                Kosaka expressed doubts about production increases because the
                                extensive movement of the Red Guard on Chinese railroads has
                                disrupted transportation. After the crop comes in he expects this
                                will be the basis for criticism of the Mao leadership.</item>

                            <item>The Chinese recognize that they are now underdeveloped and talk in
                                of terms [of] needing 20–30 years to become a developed

                            <item>Chinese higher education is now undergoing significant changes.
                                The universities and higher schools are closed until next February
                                and there are plans to shorten the school year and eliminate
                                entrance exams. In the future only students with clear-cut
                                revolutionary background will be admitted to the top universities,
                                with the result of eliminating some of the best students and a
                                general lowering of academic standards.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Kosaka concluded by saying that the key problem of Communist China is when
                        will the current contradictions come into the open. The Chinese leadership
                        says that they will not but Kosaka anticipates that the farmers will be
                        disillusioned after the harvest and maybe cause a basic showdown. He felt
                        that it was important to let the Chinese see the progress occurring outside
                        Communist China and open Chinese eyes. He asked whether there was anything
                        the Secretary wished him to convey to Chinese leadership since Liao
                        Ch'eng-chih, head of the Chinese Communist trade office, offered to convey
                        any message in the utmost secrecy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then questioned Kosaka on other aspects of Chinese Communist
                        developments. Kosaka mentioned that he had contact with the Red Guards at
                        the Peking secondary school. He found them young and very articulate but
                        they all talked the same language. When he asked them why the Red Guards had
                        been formed and the Young Communist League not utilized, they replied that
                        the <gloss target="#t_YCL1">YCL</gloss> was “old people" while the Red Guard
                        was more militant and class conscious. In response to the Secretary's
                        inquiry about Kosaka's impressions on the internal leadership <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0469"/>struggle, Kosaka said that as long as Mao
                        is alive the opposition forces in the Communist Party will be suppressed but
                        they are strong and the struggle will continue. He mentioned that he had
                        tried to see Lin Piao but was advised that Lin as a military man saw no
                        foreigners.</p>
                    <p>Kosaka mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> had
                        stressed Chinese Communist peaceful intentions to the U.S. but there were
                        two differences between the countries: (1) the U.S. refused to recognize the
                        five principles; and (2) the U.S. refused to withdraw from Taiwan and the
                        Taiwan Straits. The Secretary said that at Warsaw the Chinese Communists had
                        continually maintained the position that there was nothing to discuss until
                        we surrendered Formosa which the U.S. was not prepared to do.</p>
                    <p>On Sino-Japanese relations, Kosaka said that the Chinese Communists accepted
                        the present relationship with non-governmental trade and cultural ties and
                        no diplomatic relations. They expressed opposition to Sato but praise for
                        Ikeda and they are evidently trying to split the Liberal Democratic Party.
                        In response to a question by the Secretary, Kosaka said that there were no
                        Japanese government officials in Peking but there is a Liao-Takasaki trade
                        office there and one official who had resigned from the government. He
                        mentioned in passing that the Liao-Takasaki trade negotiations on the
                        renewal of the Liao-Takasaki trade agreement had broken down recently due to
                        the Chinese insistence that the Japanese buy more rice.</p>

                            might be interested in moving the Ambassadorial talks to Rangoon because

                            that the Chinese might suspect the taping and want an excuse to move the

                            neutral Polish ground to alternating between US and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> Embassies. Without prejudice to

                        <item>Primary factor this conclusion is current complexity and sensitivity

                            We believe it may be preferable for us to sit tight and wait to see
                            whether <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s make move on change

                            Our present thinking, however, is any such feeler to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s should be in lowest possible

                                emotion and much deliberation. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                basic policy, <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> said, is to

                                If anything along line of two Chinas should happen, this would

                                basic position. (He also later reminded Wei that it was our position

                                been a great surprise and it was most harmful. We have tried for
                                many years to keep the Canadians in line on the <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> question, but Canada is not a

                                decisive influence in the Canadian Government. Nonetheless we think

                                we know of discussions in progress between

                                Canadian-Italian consultations were still inconclusive. Sisco said
                                there are two possibilities in the present situation: On one hand, a
                                study committee resolution which contains sufficient substance <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0472"/>in the preamble which would
                                likely necessitate a 2/3 vote for adoption. From Chinese point of
                                view advantage of this proposal would be that it unlikely to achieve
                                a 2/3 vote. However, such preamble likely to have a two China
                                formula in it. Other possibility is a study committee resolution
                                which did not prejudge ultimate solution and probably would only
                                necessitate a simple majority to adopt. Such resolution would have
                                advantage of not prejudicing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                position, although better chance for its adoption since only simple

                                reference to two Chinas for the same reason as <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Other countries such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would also be opposed and for this
                                reason Canadian resolution might not pass. The Secretary added that,
                                while we could probably defeat the Canadian resolution, a simple
                                resolution for a study committee without substantive language in the
                                preamble would be more difficult.</item>

                                resolutions he had seen, he preferred the text of the US study
                                committee resolution. He said however that it would be best to
                                delete from it any reference to the People's Republic of China and
                                suggested that paragraphs two and three of the preamble be dropped.
                                He also observed that the Italian resolution is not as harmless as
                                it looks, noting that “China" is referred to without specifying
                                which one. He hoped that the US would intervene with the Italians to
                                bring about a non-prejudicial text.</item>

                                    resolution that any proposal to change China's representation
                                    was an important question. (U.N. Document A/L.494)</note> He
                                mentioned the difficult tactical decisions we face and said that
                                frankly and on most confidential basis we would be content to see
                                the Important Question passed, the Albanian resolution defeated, and

                            <item>Vice Minister Yang pointed out that to introduce any resolution
                                might confuse the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> delegates and
                                undermine our position on the Important Question and the Albanian
                                resolution and the Secretary agreed. The question was raised whether
                                introduction of a third resolution should wait until after voting on
                                the Albanian resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted that if the Canadian resolution came
                                after the other two, a substantial number of countries might favor
                                it because of its two Chinas content, <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0473"/>but we still do not think it would get a 2/3 vote.
                                The Communists would be strongly opposed and he referred to the
                                incident last year when Peking turned down an attempt to water down
                                the standard Albanian formula.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary said present events on the mainland make this a
                                particularly bad time for the international community to appear to
                                encourage Chinese Communist militancy. However, some countries view
                                Chinese representation as an important domestic political issue. The
                                Government in Italy takes this view, as does Belgium. The nature of
                                the political pressure in Canada is not so clear. The Secretary said
                                that we would not lobby for Italian study committee proposal and we
                                would strongly oppose the Canadian resolution. He suggested that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should make its strong
                                opposition to the Canadian resolution vigorously known in New York.
                                Our support of study committee proposal had been made to protect 4
                                or 5 critical votes on the Albanian resolution. Canada, Belgium,
                                Italy, and Chile had made it clear that they could vote against
                                Albanian resolution only if some third proposal is put forward in
                                the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Sisco added that Italians had
                                told us that Fanfani study committee proposal made in Parliament
                                under pressure of Socialists and that there was risk fall of Italian
                                Government if it not put forward.</item>

                            <item>Ambassador Liu said that what concerns the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> most is that if there is an untoward development,
                                it might seriously affect the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                                basic position. If it “met reverse" <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might have no choice but to leave <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary said he hoped <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> did not consider passage of a study
                                committee resolution as cause for leaving <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He noted that with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> having diplomatic relations with some 60 countries,
                                as opposed to some 46 for the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>,
                                study committee formed on this basis would be long way from defeat.
                                Secretary noted that we were not married to any precise language. We
                                want to be in touch with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on
                                which type of resolution they would prefer. Ambassador Liu said the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was moving toward the US
                                line of thinking, a simple study committee resolution.</item>

                                consisting of “wise men,” about which Ambassador Liu expressed
                                doubt. Secretary suggested that some of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> past presidents might be good possibilities. It was
                                agreed however that the more recent past presidents of the General
                                Assembly would prove troublesome. Liu said Chinese strongly prefer

                                tabled, we could pick up support from other countries on the

                                replied that some countries, such as Denmark, might shift to
                                abstention and he hoped we could get good vote on Albanian
                                resolution as result. Yang observed stronger vote on Albanian
                                resolution would have helpful influence on finding of study

                        <persName corresp="#p_SSSC1">Sampson Shen</persName> called me to <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss> 5:30 local time this afternoon to inform
                        me officially that a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> decision has been
                        taken at the highest level that if Italian resolution calling for study
                        committee were to pass, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will on the
                        same day announce its withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                        He said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had telegraphed to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> today, telling him to convey this

                    <p>2. <persName>Shen</persName> said that decision reached after consideration
                        of its consequences, and was taken in light of fact that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, after supporting position of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for
                        many years, now felt it necessary support study committee resolution that
                        has effect of calling into question GRC rights as founding members of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> felt it
                        would only encounter insults if it stayed in after study committee
                        resolution is passed. GRC would continue to work against resolution, and
                        felt there was some possibility it might not pass.</p>
                    <p>3. I registered vigorous adverse reaction to decision, terming it hasty,
                        ill-advised, not consonant with position taken by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> with Secretary last week, and not

                        on matters of major mutual concern. I noted that step if taken would amount
                        to abandonment of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> field to ChiComs
                        presenting them with a major opportunity which they might seize to detriment
                        of all allies.</p>
                    <p>4. I deplored <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> failure to give me chance

                                <persName>Chiang</persName> you cover these points:</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>When I was in Taipei last July, I made it clear to President
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> that there is no need for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to worry about the US policy of support
                            but that it should join with us in focusing on contingency tactics
                            should serious danger arise that might threaten the position of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in 21st General Assembly. Until
                            recently we had reason to hope that this danger would not arise and that
                            need for new tactics would be avoided, at least this year.
                            Unfortunately, early this month a decision by Government of Canada to
                            embark on drastic new initiative on the Chinese representation question
                            suddenly endangered our common position in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. The Under Secretary fully reviewed the situation with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> November 8 and
                            told him that we had as a result been required to support tactic of a
                            study committee resolution phrased in such a way as not to prejudice the
                            outcome of the committee's work. I later personally explained reasons we
                            felt these tactics necessary to both Ambassador Chow and FM Wei. Wei and
                            other <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reps have subsequently
                            indicated to me willingness to go along with simple study committee
                            resolution to head off the Canadians.</item>

                        <item>The principal reason that we have told Italians and others that we
                            would support non-prejudicial study committee resolution is to keep
                                <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and prevent the passage of any resolution such as that
                            sponsored by Albania.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3">On November 16, 11
                                countries including Albania submitted a draft resolution recognizing

                                representatives of Chiang Kai-shek. (U.N. Document A/L.496)</note>
                            We were and are convinced that without this tactical change there would
                            be a further erosion of support for US/GRC position on both Important
                            Question and Albanian resolution. In our minds, the supreme objective is
                            to assure that the Important Question <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0478"/>passes and the Albanian resolution is defeated. After
                            having fended off an Italian initiative last year only with difficulty,
                            we faced this year the Canadian initiative and restiveness on the part
                            of Belgium, Chile, Italy and others. Our support for study committee
                            resolution was to prevent support building up for Canadian resolution.
                            Our tactic was designed to cut the ground from under the Canadian
                            resolution, which represented a new danger this year.</item>

                            sought to eliminate from draft resolution sponsored by Italy and others
                            references prejudicing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests.

                        <item>Study committee resolution which has now been submitted by Italy and
                            others does not prejudge the outcome and does not undermine <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s basic position. I told FM <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> that we would not lobby for study
                            committee resolution, although we will vote for it, and that we would
                            strongly oppose a resolution like the one contemplated by Canada. This
                            continues to be US position. There is, of course, no reason why <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should not make its opposition to these
                            proposals known in New York and we would understand if it did. But we
                            ask most earnestly that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not take
                            rash step of withdrawing from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if
                            the study committee resolution passed. The Soviet and pro-Chinese
                            Communist bloc will oppose the study committee resolution and Peking
                            will refuse to cooperate with any such committee, so long as the
                            Republic of China remains in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But
                            if the Republic of China withdraws from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, both Peking and its supporters will seize this
                            opportunity to move into the vacancy. Thus withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would accomplish the very results sought
                            by the Albanian resolution.</item>

                            resolution pass. I am surprised and dismayed at this. You will have
                            given Peking a major victory which would enable them to pose as the sole

                            would deal a body blow to effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and make position of US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> allies in Asia vastly more difficult. It would

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> accompanied me and on

                            <persName>Shen</persName>, and interpreter Frederick Ch'ien.
                            Conversation was relaxed and friendly throughout, even during Gimo's
                            most pointed remarks about US policy. Location was Gimo's residence, not
                            office, high tea was served, and absence of other top <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials who usually sit in on
                            important conversations (Vice President, Secretary General, Chiang

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>After brief discussion of Eugene Black's recent visit, for which Gimo
                            expressed appreciation, I said that as <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> aware, we are now at very critical stage of ChiRep
                            tactics in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Because of the possibility
                            of divergence of views between our governments, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had asked me to deliver a somewhat
                            extended message, containing an explanation of where we now stand, how
                            we got there, and our views of the next steps that need to be taken. I
                            said I had been in close touch with FonMin Wei and acting <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName>Shen</persName> and we have had very helpful dialogues. My
                            request to see Gimo therefore not any reflection on Embassy's excellent
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss>. However at this
                            critical stage we felt it <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0480"/>best
                            to convey <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> views directly to
                            President <persName>Chiang</persName>. I said I had made an outline of
                            points Secretary wished me to convey, as well as my own views, and I
                            proposed to make six major points. <list>

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I then expanded on these points one by one, saying first that when
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was here in July he
                            had assured President <persName>Chiang</persName> and others that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had no reason to worry about US support
                            for Chinese position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. These
                            assurances are still good today. Secretary had also said at that time US
                            and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should concert their efforts
                            closely on possible contingency tactics in case <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position should be threatened in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Until early November it seemed that the
                            Canadians, in spite of their previous intimations that they were
                            thinking of new moves, would adhere to past position. Then suddenly they
                            told us they would introduce a new draft resolution, very objectionable
                            to us, setting up a study committee and pre-judging the results of that
                            committee's deliberations in a preamble that in effect called for one
                            China and one Taiwan. I said everything we have done since then in this
                            study committee situation has been directed at stopping this very
                            destructive resolution. I recalled that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> on Nov 8 had explained to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> reason why we felt
                            obliged to go along with some kind of non-prejudicial study committee
                            resolution in order to maintain votes on Albanian resolution. It had
                            been our policy from the beginning, and it remained imperative, that we
                            defeat that Communist resolution. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had also explained to FonMin <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> and Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> and Liu on Nov 15 that we were far
                            from enthusiastic about any study committee but that if victory were to
                            be assured on the two most important resolutions, some kind of study
                            committee resolution would have to be introduced. I reminded Gimo that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had understood from
                            FonMin <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would stand firm and would be able to
                            go along with a simple form of study committee, in order assist in
                            preventing Canada's harmful resolution from passing.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I said that our reasoning in this started from the premise that it was
                            absolutely essential to keep <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I said we had to take into
                            account a trend of opinion among many nations in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that has been <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0481"/>adverse to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            interests in recent years and months, both among some ill-informed small
                            new nations and also among some old established <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members who should know better. I said this trend was
                            continuing, although it was illogical in view of present turmoil on
                            mainland, excesses of Red Guards, and militant actions and statements
                            from Pei-ping. In the face of this trend, and of Canadian initiative,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> no longer had power to muster a
                            safe majority against Albanian resolution.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>I said it was necessary, above all, to pass important question and
                            defeat Albanian resolutions and that until destructive Canadian action
                            we thought that there was probably a definite favorable, though narrow
                            margin on both. After the Canadians began their maneuvering, several
                            countries we had relied on hinted they might not be able to support US
                            against Albanian resolution if no study committee resolution could be
                            introduced. In order to assure enough votes on the major issues some new
                            gesture was needed, although it should not, of course, undermine any
                            vital <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interest. I said we had to
                            face the fact that we needed the cooperation of other countries in order
                            to defeat the very bad Canadian resolution, and we have so far been
                            successful in obtaining this cooperation. Canada has not yet introduced
                            any counter-proposal. I emphasized that we now are reasonably confident
                            that the order of voting will be first, important question, second the
                            Albanian, and then a study committee. If we can get favorable votes on
                            the first two, we will have definite protection for ourselves and for
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and if we achieve this it will
                            be because of the small concession we made in acquiescing in but not
                            pushing, a simple study committee resolution. We had worked hard and
                            successfully to assure that nothing in favor of two Chinas appears in
                            the Italian resolution and we had been able to prevent other prejudicial
                            language.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I said although we had failed to dissuade Canada from trying to pursue
                            its course, we had effectively prevented other countries (Italy,
                            Belgium, Chile) from going along with the Canadians. We believe that the
                            simple study committee resolution now before the UN does not pre-judge
                            the issue and does not undermine any major <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests. We do not like it and we know that it is an
                            annoyance to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. However, we
                            believe that all of us should be prepared to suffer some minor
                            annoyances in order to maintain vital interests, and particularly in
                            light of the critical situation in the Far East. We understand and
                            sympathize with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s strong views
                            against any new procedure, and we appreciate that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> feels it must oppose the study
                            committee.</item>

                        <item>Gimo interrupted at this point with assertion that any study committee
                            resolution implies the existence of two Chinas. He said if study
                            committee resolution is passed this can mean nothing other than that
                            there are two Chinas to be considered.</item>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0482"/>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I repeated we understood that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must
                            oppose any study committee and that there would be no problem caused
                            between us by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts to defeat it.
                            I said we are not going to lobby for it ourselves and we will not be
                            sorry if it is defeated. However, I said, in order to win on the most
                            important issues, which are in the first two resolutions, we were forced
                            to commit ourselves passively to support a study committee. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and I wish earnestly to
                            appeal to you not to take your government out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if study committee passes. In our view
                            such a step would be rash and its consequences would be very adverse to
                            all of us. Their full magnitude would perhaps not be apparent at first
                            but must be carefully considered. I said we know Communist countries
                            will oppose the study committee and Peiping can be counted on to object
                            strongly. We are confident that Peiping will not cooperate with any
                            study committee so long as the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            remains in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and for this reason we
                            believe that the formation of such a committee should be without serious
                            risk to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. However, if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Peiping will move into the vacant China seat, if not
                            this year then next year. Therefore in our view the departure of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have the same deeply
                            hurtful effect as the passage of the Albanian resolution.</item>

                        <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, I said, had
                            received my report of my talk with Acting FonMin
                                <persName>Shen</persName> November 21. He was surprised and dismayed
                            at the statement that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would withdraw
                            if study committee passed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believes that this would constitute a major victory
                            for the Chinese Communists who would be able to pose as the sole
                            representative of China. We believe that some naive countries would be
                            impressed by ChiCom gain and would believe that ChiCom influence has
                            been greatly increased. The departure of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would inevitably
                            tend to deprive it of the support, understanding, communication, and
                            assist-ance which it has received from many nations and which it needs
                            for fulfillment of its policies. The Secretary believes such a step
                            would deal a body blow to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and
                            would cause severe problems for the US and for the Asian allies of US
                            and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. It could be expected to
                            encourage the most militant tendencies of the Chinese Communists and
                            would come at a most inopportune time in a critical stage of the Vietnam
                            war, when ChiCom policy decisions are believed to be hanging in the
                            balance. In short, we are convinced that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> withdrawal would have effect of helping our enemies and
                            hurting us and our allies.</item>

                        <item>Finally, our own concern would be profound if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> took this step which would have far-reaching adverse
                            consequences for the US as well as for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>I said these are Secretary's views and he of course wants to have
                            views of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. I suggested Gimo might
                            wish to think over these points and give me his reaction later. I
                            expressed hope that we could continue <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0483"/>dialogue between US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, concert our views, and work out a joint
                            approach.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>I then gave my own hope that after this difficult year in UN we might
                            see a turn for the better. There might be more nations who would
                            experience a revulsion against current Peiping statements and actions. I
                            noted that Soviets were lukewarm in supporting ChiComs in UN this year
                            and speculated that countries like Indonesia and Ghana might be able to
                            come all the way over to our side on this issue next year. I said it is
                            also conceivable ChiComs might take some extremely rash action that
                            would destroy the support they presently receive from various other
                            countries. Important thing is to get through this present year and to
                            stand fast on the basic requirement. I said “If you can stand with us,
                            we can win through”.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Gimo said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had already given serious
                        consideration to most of these points, but he thanked me for outlining them
                        clearly. He said GRC has thought of UN as something precious, and felt the
                        obligations and anxieties of a founding member. He said that for this reason
                        if GRC had to make any decision damaging to UN it would be only after
                        careful consideration of consequences. GRC does not start only today in
                        concern for and efforts to safeguard principles and Charter of UN; it
                        started long ago. These efforts have been not only for the UN itself, or for
                        GRC, but for the US also, and GRC will always be mindful of sacrifices in
                        men and treasure made by US in WWII. I said USG also treasures its long and
                        close association with GRC in good times and in bad.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said he fully understood what I had said, and that he appreciated
                        sincerity of Secretary's tactical efforts in the difficult problems of the
                        UN. He said he was aware of the hard work done by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in achieving present text of Italian resolution, and he
                        understood the reasons for the US policy of passive acquiescence in a study
                        committee. However, he said, whether the resolution passes or not is
                        something the US can arrange.</p>
                    <p>I denied this emphatically, saying I wished it were true but that we simply
                        do not have the power to ensure its defeat.</p>
                    <p>Gimo in characteristic fashion shrugged this off, saying that we are good
                        friends, and so should not argue. Fact remains, he said, that “passive
                        support" is in fact support, and that although <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> says it is not lobbying, passive support has the same
                        effect, as he had just seen a news report that after Amb.
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> saw Shiina in Tokyo, the Japanese announced
                        they would vote in favor of a study committee. This, he said, looked like
                        lobbying to him.</p>
                    <p>I said Amb. <persName>Johnson</persName> had not asked for Japanese support
                        of study committee but Gimo remained unconvinced, saying that although he
                        had no report of substance of conversation he believed the events were more
                        than coincidental.</p>
                    <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>Gimo said that while he understood what <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        had tried to do to safeguard <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position,
                        to Chinese people in Taiwan, on mainland, and overseas, it will appear that
                        a study committee if established shatters the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position, and therefore the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position with Chinese people cannot be safeguarded in this
                        manner. He said it was up to the US to decide whether study committee
                        resolution should pass or not. First two resolutions could be won, and
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has announced it will give passive
                        support to the third. It is still in the realm of possibility, he said, for
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to maneuver to defeat the study
                        committee and thus to reassure the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> of
                        the friendship and motives of the US.</p>
                    <p>I reiterated that we do not have the capability to defeat resolution, and
                        that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cooperation and understanding is
                        very important to us. I said that I thought that our friends in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would understand quite well what we had to do
                        in order to prevent serious reverse, and would understand we had simply
                        chosen the lesser of evils, and had not modified our policy of full support
                        for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said he and I were old friends, and we did not need to pursue this
                        further, since we understood each other. He recalled that Secretary in July
                        had emphasized the importance of upholding the UN and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. He said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was well aware of its obligations to uphold these
                        fundamentals, and that he knew the US to be a major upholder to them. He
                        said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believed that any damage to
                        position of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> constituted damage to UN Charter and ideals because of GRC
                        status as founding member. He said he had told Secretary that as long as any
                        formula does not damage the legitimate position of GRC or of UN Charter, GRC
                        will go along, but if anything damages these, GRC cannot go along.</p>
                    <p>I said we agreed with these principles, and with the importance of the
                        Charter. I pointed out that the study committee resolution contains the
                        phrase “in keeping with the principles and purposes of the Charter”, and
                        that we believed this to be a safeguard for the GRC. I said USG certainly
                        did not wish to harm the interests of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and that we did not believe the resolution had that
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said he fully understood <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> goodwill
                        and good intentions having this inserted in the resolution as a safeguard.
                        However he wanted to make two points: (a) the US should not take an action
                        that would cause Chinese people everywhere to have doubt of US basic policy,
                        or to think US has shattered the position of the GRC or has given up the
                        GRC. He urged that US think of these effects.</p>
                    <p>I said we agreed it was very important not to mislead anyone as to our
                        intentions, and not to cause any Chinese to misunderstand us or to believe
                        US was abandoning GRC, since this was not the case.</p>
                    <p>Gimo expressed hope that US course would be in accordance with this idea. He
                        went on to his second point, (b), saying that to any ordinary Chinese the
                        passage of a study committee was tantamount to a 2-Chinas <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0485"/>formula. Even if the first two resolutions
                        were to pass safely, assuring one more year for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, it would be widely understood that next year or the year
                        after the ChiComs would come in. He said that rather than be expelled in
                        disgrace later, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would do better to leave
                        now. He said that if the study committee resolution is adopted, then to the
                        general public it would mean that the US has changed to a 2-China policy,
                        and that US is ready to give up the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.
                        Even if the GRC were willing to endure for the sake of the UN and the US,
                        the Chinese people would not stand for a government of that sort.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should understand that
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been in a very awkward position
                        for a long time, particularly since the Yalta conference when GRC gave
                        acquiescence to a damaging fait accompli, brought about without any GRC
                        consultation or knowledge. GRC had suffered the loss of Outer Mongolia, of
                        Manchuria, and ultimately the mainland of China. Chinese have had many
                        bitter lessons, and now if in the face of a study committee, GRC stays in
                        the UN the Chinese people will be disillusioned with Chinese Government as
                        well (Comment: presumably as well as with GRC's allies). He said GRC can
                        give up anything, and had even lost the mainland, but could not give up its
                        legal position. After all, he said, “My government and to some extent myself
                        must bear a heavy historical responsibility. If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> stays in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> there would be
                        no way to answer our responsibilities to our history, our people, and
                        ourselves”. He said he did not intend to force his ideas upon <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, but it was clear that GRC could not
                        acquiesce in seeing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> principles and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter being destroyed, as well as
                        destruction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position. He said he had
                        appreciated close US cooperation in the past decade or so and that he wished
                        once again to thank USG for its assistance in maintaining GRC in Taiwan. He
                        said he was not trying to force us into any course and would try to refrain
                        from doing damage to US. He recalled that GRC had for many years kept US
                        interests closely in mind. He said even if GRC were not in UN, GRC would be
                        willing to cooperate fully with USG to defeat ChiComs. He said he believed
                        US still had possibility of maneuvering to keep Chinese Communists out of UN
                        even if GRC were not in, and therefore he believed <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would not be doing damage to US interests.</p>
                    <p>I expressed appreciation for his generous sentiments in regard to past US
                        assistance and cooperation. I said I wondered if some way could not be found
                        to make clear to Chinese people everywhere that a study committee does not
                        change policy of US or position of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. I
                        said perhaps the committee would come up next year with a favorable
                        recommendation and even if this were not the case, we should not take it for
                        granted that there must be a disastrous result. I said I believed this could
                        be explained so as not to damage <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        standing.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said it would be almost impossible to explain this. He repeated that US
                        tactics in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were of course up to the US
                        and that <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0486"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> without interfering would keep in close
                        contact to discuss such tactics. However, he said, by far the best tactic
                        would be the defeat of the study committee.</p>
                    <p>I said I would like to make a military analogy. I believed we were engaged in
                        a very important central battle on the first two resolutions in the UN. The
                        study committee question, while important, was somewhere off on one flank.
                        The major cause, on the main front, was gravely in doubt, and in order to be
                        sure of winning there we have had to take a little strength from the
                        non-vital flank in order to bolster the main front. We have been forced to
                        do this in order to insure against an unacceptable defeat. We earnestly hope
                        that none of our allies would be so upset by the position on the flank that
                        they would desert the entire battlefield.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said he understood the analogy and agreed that the issues as far as US
                        was concerned were tactical. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would
                        cooperate with allies as long as tactics were not harmful to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> principles.</p>
                    <p>I said I also hoped for continued cooperation. I warned that it was not
                        likely that in event of withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position could be maintained and
                        protected, as Gimo seemed to think. I said I was not prepared to go into
                        detail on consequences, magnitude could not now be predicted, but adverse
                        effects would surely be more far-reaching than President apparently
                        assumed.</p>
                    <p>Gimo again said that even if GRC not in UN, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could find ways to keep ChiComs out. He observed that
                        anyway GRC had caused many problems for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> presence in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been invaluable in many ways. I recalled that study
                        committee proposal in 1950 had come to nothing, and hoped that this time it
                        could be sidetracked also.</p>
                    <p>Gimo said that things had changed greatly since 1950 and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had made careful study of the problem. He
                        closed the conversation by saying that we must try not to let this present
                        serious issue prevent our cooperation on other issues.</p>
                    <p>Comment: Gimo gives every evidence of having thought his course through, and
                        being determined to proceed, in sorrow rather than in anger. There are two
                        imponderables, however: (a) precise nature and finality of walkout, and (b)
                        possibility, rather remote, that senior GRC officials will be willing and
                        able to persuade Gimo to change his mind. At this point I am bearish on the
                        prospect for a reversal of decision, but not inclined to consider it
                        entirely hopeless.</p>

                    <p>Referring to the Canadian proposal on Chinese representation, the Secretary
                        said he had one action recommendation to make to the Foreign Minister. The
                        Secretary noted that some of our Allies in the Far East who rely on us have
                        the feeling that Canada would never have put forward its proposal without
                        consultation and agreement with the United States. <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0490"/>The Secretary hoped that Canadian
                        Ambassadors in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and Thailand
                        would make clear to their host governments that this was not the case. It
                        was urgent that this should be done as soon as possible and before November
                        28, if feasible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> said that Taiwan certainly knew the true
                        situation on this matter since there had already been a discussion on the
                        subject between Taiwan representatives and the Canadians. He would undertake
                        to instruct other Canadian Ambassadors in the countries mentioned by the
                        Secretary to clarify the situation to the host governments.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had heard a news report that the question of Communist
                        China's entry into the Security Council might come up in January. He did not
                        know exactly how this might arise; whether on an issue of credentials or
                        otherwise, but in any case he wanted the Foreign Minister to know that we
                        would vote against. We would expect that our vote in this sense would be
                        considered as a veto; if not—if somehow the matter were considered as a
                        procedural one—this would be intolerable for the United States. We will not
                        be over-run on this issue. Martin said he did not see how Communist China
                        could be considered for membership in the Security Council unless it were a
                        member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organization, but in any
                        case he was sure that the US vote against would be regarded as a veto.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Canadian proposal on ChiRep, <persName>Martin</persName>
                        commented that he had told his people there were some things the Canadians
                        had to do which <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> would not
                        like, but nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had never
                        threatened him.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> had to do what he
                        considered necessary, but it was clear that the Canadian move on ChiRep had
                        been made without the concurrence of the United States, the United Kingdom,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Australia and even Communist
                        China. No one went along with it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wanted the Canadians to go even further than they had gone.
                        Nevertheless he was sure that what Canada had done was right and that the US
                        would agree to this in due course.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that perhaps <persName>Martin</persName> had made his
                        point with the Canadian press—The Toronto Globe—but internationally the move
                        had not been accepted.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Martin</persName> replied that The Toronto Globe actually did not
                        like the Canadian proposal on ChiRep, although its view on diplomatic
                        recognition of China was another matter. In any event, he was sure that
                        Canada had been right. He did not feel it was useful to pursue the
                        discussion of this subject at this time, but perhaps at some later date they
                        could talk with the Secretary about it when things had cooled off
                        somewhat.</p>
                    <p>On another aspect of Chinese representation, <persName>Martin</persName>
                        noted that the Indian Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        was convinced that there would be no <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0491"/>progress concerning Communist China's entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> until Communist China and the United States
                        started talking and worked out an arrangement. The UN could do nothing. The
                        Secretary noted that we have done more talking directly with the Chinese
                        Communists than any other member of the UN with the possible exception of
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on his visit to Italy, <persName>Martin</persName> said that all
                        of his discussions with Italian officials had been on Chinese
                        representation. He had found Moro especially concerned to do nothing which
                        would go counter to US views on the subject. <persName>Martin</persName>
                        also had had a most interesting talk with Nenni. Nenni had said that he
                        personally would like to go farther than the study resolution but he doubted
                        the advisability of doing so, given the opposition of the United States.
                        Nenni had noted that politics was the art of the possible and he advised
                        against seeking more than the study resolution at this time.</p>

                        <item>As you know, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> has
                            formally told us that he would withdraw immediately from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if the Italian draft study committee
                            resolution passed. The vote on this may come as early as Monday night,

                        <item>We gave Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName>
                            all the arguments, and he has laid them out brilliantly to the Gimo, but
                            without apparently budging him. <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> has also been hitting every senior Chinese
                            official he can reach. Finally, I have enlisted Walter Judd to write a
                            personal message to the Gimo. However, it seems to me clear that the
                            matter requires a personal message by you, in view of the disastrous
                            effect of such a withdrawal and the very important impact that your
                            personal intervention might have.</item>

                        <item>I have therefore drafted a fairly short and fundamental letter for

                                that the President cleared the short version of the letter to Chiang
                                and that the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> message to

                            letter by repeating the more technical arguments. If, however, upon
                            seeing the two messages together, you thought it desirable to transfer
                            some or all of the arguments in the second draft letter to your own
                            letter, this could readily be done.</item>

                            both letters as soon as possible. This would permit the Gimo to reflect
                            before his final decision—which as of now appears to be for
                            withdrawal.</item>

                                conversation with you about our common problem in the United
                                Nations. I appreciate your courtesy in explaining to him so fully
                                the Republic of China's position on the question of a General
                                Assembly resolution calling for a study committee to consider the
                                question of Chinese representation. In candor I must say that I was
                                profoundly concerned to learn that your government is considering
                                withdrawal from the United Nations should the General Assembly pass
                                the Italian-sponsored resolution now before it. We cannot at this
                                point predict whether the resolution will pass. But, even if it
                                should, your withdrawal from the United Nations would in my opinion
                                be a tragedy for both our countries. Its consequences would be
                                far-reaching and fraught with dangers, not only for China but for
                                the free world position in Asia.</item>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Minister: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>As you undoubtedly know, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> has talked at
                                    length with your President about the position of your government
                                    in connection with the Italian resolution for a study committee.
                                    Although this conversation covered most of the critical matters,
                                    I am sending you this personal letter to underscore certain
                                    points. At the same time, President Johnson is sending a
                                    personal and separate letter to your President.</item>

                                <item>First of all, let me assure you again that the United States
                                    decision to vote for a non-prejudicial study committee
                                    resolution was taken only after the most careful and
                                    thoroughgoing deliberation. As you know, we have maintained
                                    closest consultations with the GRC in Taipei, Washington and New
                                    York from the time earlier in the year when I and other
                                    officials discussed with your government the danger which might
                                    develop at the UNGA this autumn and the possible need for new
                                    tactics. We have had only one objective in view: to preserve the
                                    position of the Republic of China in the United Nations.</item>

                                <item>In early November, Canada, without prior consultation and
                                    despite our strongest protests, told us that it would introduce
                                    a resolution with “one-China-one-Taiwan" overtones and calling
                                    for the seating of Peiping in the Security Council. The
                                    situation in the General Assembly was made even more perilous by
                                    the restiveness on the question shown by Italy, Belgium and
                                    Chile. In this sudden emergency we had no choice but to fall
                                    back on the tactic of a study committee in an effort to head off
                                    Canada's dangerous initiative, which if unchecked could have
                                    lost us their support and the support of others on the important
                                    question and against the Albanian resolution. This step has now
                                    succeeded in forestalling the threatened Canadian move. I hope
                                    that it will also enable us to achieve a better vote than last
                                    year on the important question resolution and against the
                                    Albanian resolution.</item>

                                <item>I am sure you understand that in taking this step the United
                                    States is in no way altering its policy of firm support of the
                                    Republic of China. We remain determined to oppose with the full
                                    strength and influence of the United States all attempts to
                                    expel the Republic of China from the United Nations and to seat
                                    the Communists.</item>

                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>We have a close treaty bond with the Republic of China which
                                    is a solemn obligation. China and the United States have a
                                    history of particularly close friendship and alliance extending
                                    over many years. The cooperation and collaboration between us
                                    has had many remarkable accomplishments and successes and I am
                                    sure there will be many more. In view of this long and intimate
                                    association between our countries, I am confident that our
                                    position in this matter enjoys your understanding and that of
                                    your President.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Your President has suggested to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> that it might
                                    still be possible for the United States to maneuver to defeat
                                    the Italian resolution. We have told several governments who
                                    have asked us that we would not object if they were to vote
                                    against it. We have not urged any government to vote for it. As
                                    I told you last week, the United States would in fact be content
                                    if the Italian proposal were to fail, and we entirely understand
                                    your government's efforts to defeat it. We cannot go beyond this
                                    because our vote for the Italian resolution was the price we had
                                    to pay for critically needed support on the important question
                                    and Albanian resolutions.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>In talking to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName>, your President observed that to the
                                    public the study committee resolution appears tantamount to a
                                    two-Chinas formula. This is not, however, the view of the United
                                    States. Our representatives have exerted themselves with success
                                    to assure that no language is incorporated in the study
                                    committee resolution which prejudges the outcome of the study.
                                    The resolution's operative paragraph stipulates that the
                                    committee's findings be “in keeping with the principles and
                                    purposes of the Charter.” This stipulation in our view was
                                    essential as a safeguard of the GRC position. There is moreover
                                    no means of foretelling at this time whether the committee will
                                    in fact ultimately arrive at any agreed conclusions; nor, if
                                    reached, what those conclusions might be; nor what action the
                                    General Assembly might take on them. Why leave the field of
                                    battle and thus precipitate the very situation we both have
                                    striven so long and successfully to prevent when the outcome has
                                    yet to be determined? This is the time to stay and fight and not
                                    withdraw.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>There is one point your President made to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McCon-aughy</persName> which I want
                                    particularly to mention. This is the suggestion that the United
                                    States could still find means to prevent the Chinese Communists
                                    from entering the United Nations even if the Republic of China
                                    were to withdraw. If you should withdraw, we believe the voting
                                    situation would change drastically and that Peiping would be
                                    seated. Your withdrawal from the United Nations would bring
                                    about exactly what the supporters of the Albanian resolution
                                    desire.</item>
                                <label>9.</label>
                                <item>Representatives from Communist China could with relative ease
                                    appear in the General Assembly and ask that their credentials be
                                    accepted as the only representatives from China. If you had
                                    withdrawn <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0495"/>from the UN,
                                    it seems to us a foregone conclusion that the Assembly would
                                    accept such credentials. As to the Security Council, I
                                    reaffirmed our position to your President in 1964. That position
                                    stands. However, the Security Council would have to act
                                    independently on credentials of any representative seeking
                                    accreditation there. If your representatives had left the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, there would be an overwhelming
                                    sentiment to accept representatives from Peiping, and the
                                    possibility of a veto would be far less relevant than in case of
                                    a contest between competing representatives, and indeed would in
                                    all probability no longer exist.</item>

                                <item>I believe the consequences of a withdrawal from the United
                                    Nations by the Republic of China would be extremely serious for
                                    both our countries. By opening the United Nations door to
                                    Peiping, the Communists would be given an important victory at
                                    no cost to themselves—and at a time when the Communist forces on
                                    the mainland of China are in deep disarray. The encouragement
                                    this victory would give to the Communists could have
                                    incalculable consequences for the struggle for freedom we are
                                    now waging in Viet-nam. It would deal a blow to the
                                    effectiveness of the United Nations, and it would make more
                                    difficult the position of our countries' friends and allies in
                                    Asia.</item>
                                <label>11.</label>
                                <item>Another consequence, which I consider just as serious, is the
                                    irreparable damage that withdrawal from the United Nations would
                                    do to the world position of your own government, which for the
                                    achievement of its policies must have international
                                    understanding and support. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                    withdrawal would confuse the Republic of China's friends abroad
                                    and hearten its enemies. This step would come at a moment when
                                    the US particularly needs <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                    cooperation in the difficult <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    situation and would be regarded as a reverse to our common

                                <item>Finally, I would like to leave this thought with you.
                                    Communist China's aim is to get the Republic of China out of the
                                    UN by one means or other, and establish itself in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in the eyes of the world as
                                    the only legitimate government of China. So long as you remain
                                    in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, as they have repeated
                                    again only Thursday, the Communist Chinese will not accept
                                    membership. Your presence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, in effect, is the surest guarantee against a

                            carrying, and hoped he had some relaxation over weekend. I said I
                            appreciated his making time to see me on short notice. Gimo said he
                            always took pleasure in seeing me and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>

                            Gimo said he had listened carefully, and appreciated the letter.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I told Gimo that it seemed likely that Secy <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> could come to Taipei on evening of Dec 6, staying
                            all following day and leaving about noon Dec 8.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Gimo said that of course he welcomed Secretary's visit. He said that
                            insofar as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problems were concerned,
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> still hoped Italian resolution
                            might not pass and then <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would need
                            to take no action. The situation would of course be discussed with Secy
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. However, he said, he
                            understood that voting in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will take
                            place this week and if Italian resolution passes, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cannot remain silent. The timing is
                            very important. However, he said, referring to the letter from President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>, which he considered to be sincere and
                            frank, he would bring the letter to the attention of officials of his
                            govt so that they could consult further on the problem.</item>

                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Gimo said that the most important question to study now is how to
                            defeat the Italian resolution. He said that once it has passed the GRC
                                <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0497"/>”would have to make its

                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I replied that I understood what he had told me on this point in this

                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Gimo said that of course before he took any action he would have to
                            consult with officers of his govt. He said that he would inform the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of his govt's decision, would
                            get <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> reaction, and would continue
                            consult with us.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>I said I hoped we could keep in very close contact on this matter, and
                            that I was available at any hour of day or night for any
                            consultations.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Gimo repeated that the most important task is to defeat the Italian
                            resolution. He said that he had studied the Secretary's letter to FonMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName>, and that although he
                            fully understood that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has adopted
                            passive attitude, it is still most important that the resolution be
                            defeated.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>I said I wished to give a brief resume of recent developments relative
                            to the pending UN resolutions. I said there had been full exchanges on
                            this in Washington, New York, and elsewhere with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials and with representatives of many countries. I
                            said we had also told US Embassies to make it clear to other govts that
                            we are not lobbying for, pushing, or soliciting votes for the
                            resolution. Our representatives are also making it explicit that we
                            would not object to or hold it against any country wishing to oppose the
                            resolution.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>I noted that our intention to vote affirmatively on Italian resolution
                            was based on the commitment we were compelled to give in order to obtain
                            the very crucial votes of certain countries that were wavering on the
                            Albanian resolution. We are now bound to honor our word but Gimo could
                            rest assured that our vote is not an enthusiastic one. We believe that
                            our tactical decision has safeguarded from 6 to 8 votes which are
                            essential in order to assure defeat of Albanian proposal. It could be
                            seen that our move would have a successful result.</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>I said we had given careful and sympathetic consideration to the
                            diplomatic note sent to us November 26 asking us not to vote for the
                            Italian proposal.<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">Not found.</note> In view
                            of commitment we have already made to other nations in order to assure
                            defeat of the Albanian resolution, we cannot change our vote now.
                            However, I was confident other nations understood our position and
                            clearly realized we are not pressing any other country to vote for the
                            Italian proposal.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>Gimo asked if US position could be made clear to Japanese Govt. He
                            said similar diplomatic note had also been sent to Japanese Embassy here
                            requesting <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> abstain. He said that
                            what I had told him of US instructions should be made clear to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and he made a direct request that we
                            accomplish this.</item>

                        <item>I said I was sure that this had already been done, but would send a
                            special message (see septel) asking that US position be explained once

                        <label>18.</label>
                        <item>I said we had carefully studied the voting prospects on all three

                            question and the Albanian, we were confident of favorable outcome. We do
                            not yet know, however, what will be the result of voting on Italian
                            proposal. The position of many countries appeared uncertain, and we do
                            not know whether it will be defeated or passed.</item>
                        <label>19</label>
                        <item>Gimo repeated that if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> were to
                            support <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in working on this, Italian
                            resolution could be defeated. He said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is fully aware of the very important implications of
                            the Italian resolution and would have to take a position based on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s own interests, and also those of US,
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and allies. He said all these
                            interests will be taken into account in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> deliberations.</item>
                        <label>20.</label>
                        <item>I said we had been thinking of contingency planning in the event that
                            the Italian resolution were to pass and of appropriate action <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might take to make its position clear.
                            I said I would like to suggest in rough form some language <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might wish to consider for use in a
                            declaration in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in that event, along
                            following lines: “<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has every
                            confidence that any objective study of ChiRep must have the result of
                            reaffirmation of the status of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            as the only qualified, lawful and representative Government of China.
                            Therefore, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has nothing to fear from
                            a study of the question, although it is unnecessary. However, in the
                            event of any objectionable recommendation by the study committee, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reserves its full rights to take
                            any action it considers necessary and appropriate under the
                            circumstances.” I said it was our belief that such a statement would be
                            dignified, appropriate, and sufficient to safeguard GRC interests and
                            prestige.</item>
                        <label>21.</label>
                        <item>Gimo replied that my suggestion would be of value for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reference and discussion, but Chinese
                            people would never understand if such a statement were made. However, he
                            said, he would have to consult with other govt officials on this as well
                            as other points.</item>

                        <item>I said I hoped the public would be enabled to understand the US
                            position. I noted that Chinese press seems to be giving the erroneous
                            impression that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been proceeding
                            in the direction of a “two-Chinas" policy in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This could be damaging to our joint interests if it
                            should become widespread. I hoped the impression could be

                        <item>Gimo assured me he would do what could be done to see that Chinese
                            people understood and do not get wrong impression of US intentions.
                            However, the Chinese people would not understand if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were to take any action that does not
                            conform to its present foreign policies. He said he would carefully
                            consider this matter. Alloted time for interview was clearly up at this
                            point.</item>

                        <item>As we left Presidential residence, I told Acting FonMin
                                <persName>Shen</persName> that I had a few additional points I
                            wished to make and we adjourned to Shen's office for further
                            discussion.</item>
                        <label>25.</label>
                        <item>I told Shen that I wished to reaffirm the contingency assurance given
                            by Secretary Rusk in 1964 that USG intended veto any attempt at ChiCom
                            admission to Security Council, if veto would be effective. However, if
                            the GRC had already left the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, our
                            parliamentary position in trying to keep Chinese Communists out would be
                            vastly more difficult. We have grave doubt that veto in the Security
                            Council would be effective under those circumstances. Most Security
                            Council members would probably think that in absence of GRC from UN,
                            filling of vacant China seat would be purely procedural matter of
                            credentials, and that veto would be inapplicable on those grounds. I
                            told Shen GRC should not assume that it would be possible to keep
                            ChiComs out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> withdrew. We anticipated that once GRC
                            left, ChiComs would have relatively easy sailing. If GRC stayed firmly
                            in UN, however, chances of keeping ChiComs out would be very good. GRC
                            should be under no delusion that walkout could be only a temporary
                            maneuver. Both from the viewpoint of psychological effect on vote of
                            countries that are already wavering, and in terms of parliamentary
                            procedures open to the opposition, walkout would likely be final,
                            however <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intended.</item>
                        <label>26.</label>
                        <item>I noted that recent ChiCom public statements reveal a somewhat softer
                            position on conditions for ChiCom entry into UN. I referred to November
                            25 column in Peoples Daily, signed “Observer" which strongly attacked
                            Canadian proposition but which omitted any reference to the preposterous
                            conditions that ChiComs laid down last year as prerequisites to their
                            entry into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This article also
                            carefully avoided usual intemperate language which might alienate the
                            uncommitted. It is possible that ChiComs are now actively interested in
                            obtaining <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> entry. In any event, it is
                            evident to us that there would be great rejoicing in Peiping if GRC
                            walked out. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should give most sober
                            and skeptical consideration to any prospective course that would play
                            into hands of ChiComs and harm US, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            and allies.</item>

                        <item>I said it was our considered view that US security position in
                            Southeast Asia could be seriously prejudiced by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> walkout. I asked <persName>Shen</persName> to give this
                            his solemn consideration. Chinese Communists would be emboldened by
                            apparent success their tough stance, and might be tempted to intervene
                            more openly in SEA. I reminded Shen that Gimo had assured Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on July 3 that GRC policy
                            was first and foremost to give help to US position in Vietnam, ahead of
                            any other <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> obligation. If GRC did not
                            hold fast in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, US position in Vietnam
                            would be affected adversely. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said in letter to FonMin <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName>, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> departure would
                            confuse <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s friends and help its
                            enemies. It would be interpreted as a grave setback for the US and
                            allies, exposing allied position in Vietnam and undermining allied
                            influence in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>28.</label>
                        <item>I said that if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> persisted in
                            withdrawal move, it would almost seem that GRC was not interested in
                            maintaining the traditional posture of a great national government,
                            aware of its international ties and responsibilities. In self-imposed
                            isolation from international life, GRC would have more the posture of a
                            local regime of some kind. A GRC with no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> status would give impetus to the unfriendly argument in
                            the UN that government here was acting as a local regime and should be
                            considered as under the authority of Peiping. USG of course did not
                            share such unwarranted opinion but its widespread existence in UN might
                            make it difficult to uphold the juridical position of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>29.</label>
                        <item>I repeated my view expressed to Chang Chun on Nov. 26 that GRC could
                            not really be humiliated by resolutely staying in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and defending its principles. I said that abusive
                            tactics of unworthy persons or nations cannot humilate those who are
                            worthy. By remaining in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> status would by no means be demeaned,
                            but rather would be enhanced by exhibition of GRC courage and resolve in
                            standing up to contemptible efforts of its enemies.</item>

                            <persName>Shen</persName> promised to convey all the foregoing
                            representations to President immediately. He said would give final

                            <persName>Shen</persName> then said with considerable asperity that the
                            GRC had just about reached its limit in enduring insults at UN. He said
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position in Security Council had
                            been eroded, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had been “kicked
                            out of" Ecosoc, and with the departure of Wellington Koo for the first
                            time there was no representative on the ICJ of a permanent member of SC.
                            He said that most recently in course of tactical deliberation on
                            Israel-Jordan situation, USG had not consulted GRC, that GRC was not
                            included in any of consultative groups, and that the US officials
                            “walked right by GRC representatives in UN lounge, without greeting or
                            comment.” He said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is not in fact
                            highly regarded by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members or even by
                            some US officials. However, calming down considerably, he said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would give all these US representations
                            very serious consideration. He said he <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0501"/>did not know how the decision would come out, but he
                            thought it would be reached and would be conveyed to me in a very short
                            time.</item>
                        <label>32.</label>
                        <item>In closing the conversation I urged again that no final walkout
                            decision if Italian resolution were to pass should be taken before
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s visit.</item>
                        <label>33.</label>
                        <item>Comment: Failure of Gimo and <persName>Shen</persName> to reiterate
                            previous assertion that decision is final is of course hopeful sign.
                            However, I believe crisis is far from over and it is entirely
                            conceivable that Gimo has been somewhat stung by our references to rash
                            and precipitous decision and is merely demonstrating to us the soberness
                            with which GRC will consider all aspects of situation. It is also
                            possible that representations made by me and by Embassy officers to
                            substantial number of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> figures may
                            have resulted in some voices being raised against Gimo's proposed course
                            of action. If there have been such voices, however, they have probably
                            not been very loud and Gimo clearly has capability to override them if
                            he remains determined to walk out. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            mind seems a little less closed today than yesterday but situation
                            remains precarious.</item>

                            of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were to stay with no reaction, there would be no way to

                        <item>He then read at dictation speed full text of new declaration which
                            FonMin <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> now instructed to make

                            <persName>Shen</persName> explained that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intended effect of this statement to be temporary
                            withdrawal from GA only and not from other organizations. He said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might even return to current session GA
                            at any time to join debate if delegation so instructed. I pointed out
                            that unfriendly elements in UN could still seize on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> declaration of withdrawal and assert
                            that Chinese seat in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was vacant. I
                            suggested that clearer language might be used so as to avoid
                            misunderstanding.</item>

                            <persName>Shen</persName> said Chinese text only of text of this
                            declaration had been sent to ChiDel, which would make its own English
                            translation.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I suggested ChiDel should consult with USDel parliamentary experts so
                            as to minimize possibility that language of declaration might be used to
                            bar GRC. I said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is fearful that
                            hostile elements could seize on any walkout and through parliamentary
                            tactics try to declare China's seat to be vacant. I recalled that
                            present <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> President is not sympathetic
                            on this issue. I urged that great caution be used in wording of
                            declaration so that no bridges could be burned. After some discussion
                            with <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> of wording of Chinese text, it
                            appeared that better and more accurate translation for ChiDel phrase
                            “withdraw its presence" might be “absent itself.” Shen agreed to
                            telegraph ChiDel to consult with USDel on this point.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>Today's votes on Chinese representation were even better than we had
                        anticipated, doubtless due in large part to the existence of the study
                        committee alternative to the Albanian resolution. The important question
                        resolution was carried 66–48–7 as opposed to last year's vote of 56–49–11.
                        The Albanian resolution was defeated 46–57–17, in contrast to last year's
                        tie vote of 47–47–20.</p>
                    <p>By a surprisingly large vote of 51–37–30 the Assembly decided that the study
                        committee resolution fell under the important question procedure. Syria's
                        unexpected initiative, which produced this vote, undoubtedly contributed
                        substantially to the overwhelming defeat of the study committee resolution,
                        34–62–25.</p>
                    <p>The voting on the procedural question and the Italian resolution reflected
                        the strong desire of the Communist countries and their non-aligned
                        supporters to ensure defeat of the study committee resolution. Ironically,
                        the Syrian move also served the interest of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>—to bury the study committee idea. The absence of a roll
                        call on the Syrian motion was helpful to us in not highlighting our negative
                        vote.</p>

                        abstain on the Albanian resolution while voting in favor of the important
                        question and the Italian resolution. Other interesting results were: <list>

                                        China. The regulations authorize us to impose area
                                        restrictions on travel of American citizens only in the

                                        welfare of . . . the nation as a whole”. Under the terms of
                                        the regulations, if we are to maintain travel restrictions,
                                        we must publish by December 19th the names of the areas
                                        which meet this standard “along with a statement of the
                                        circumstances requiring the restriction”.</item>

                                    <item>We have strong doubts that a persuasive case can be
                                        maintained that removal of the current restrictions on
                                        travel to Communist China would “seriously impair the
                                        conduct of United States foreign affairs”. In a very real
                                        sense, we have already taken the position that the travel of
                                        American citizens to Communist China does not in fact
                                        “seriously impair" the conduct of our foreign policy toward
                                        that country. The categories of American citizens whom we
                                        are prepared to allow to visit mainland China have, over the
                                        past year, been expanded to the point where <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0506"/>literally tens of thousands

                                        our general position, as formulated by the President on July
                                        12, 1966, that “the greatest force for opening closed minds
                                        and closed societies is the free flow of ideas and people
                                        and goods" also makes it difficult for us to argue in public
                                        that restrictions on travel to Communist China are necessary
                                        or desirable.</item>

                                        on travel to Communist China depend (a) upon how Peking

                                    <item>We have little doubt that our national interests would be
                                        served in an important way by the travel of some thousands
                                        of Americans to Communist China each year. As is indicated
                                        by the President's statement referred to above, the gradual
                                        expansion of the categories of American citizens whom we are
                                        prepared to allow to visit mainland China, and our efforts
                                        at Warsaw, our interest in increasing the number and scope
                                        of our peaceful relationships with Communist China is as
                                        much a part of our long-range policy for China as is our
                                        firm commitment to resist that country's aggressive actions
                                        vigorously. Opening a wide and mutually profitable range of
                                        peaceful contacts is a necessary complement to resist-ance
                                        to Communist Chinese aggression. Both have the same end of
                                        eventually persuading mainland China to turn its energies
                                        into non-aggressive, responsible channels.</item>

                                    <item>There are, we believe, several risks of unrestricted
                                        travel to China which should be considered. <list>

                                            <item>First, there may be significant effects on the
                                                flow of intelligence. For example, China might
                                                attempt to make use of ethnic Chinese in the United
                                                States to obtain classified information which is not
                                                now available to them. We believe that the
                                                prospective gains to the U.S. in intelligence about
                                                China, a closed society, would be greater than those
                                                which would be realized by China. Much of the
                                                information we lack about China would be filled in
                                                by ordinary observation. The information they lack
                                                cannot be obtained without a security
                                                clearance.</item>
                                            <label>(b)</label>
                                            <item>Second, unrestricted travel would, to a small
                                                extent, increase Peking's power to harass the United
                                                States by imprisoning Americans, if this were its
                                                desire. The increase in power would, however, be
                                                small. It has ample opportunity for harassment today
                                                in the form of the exceptions <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0507"/>for newsmen, doctors,
                                                scientists, scholars, and people prominent in
                                                commercial, cultural, athletic and other fields. The
                                                experience of other nations whose citizens travel to
                                                China suggests that this risk is not excessive,
                                                despite such recent events as the detention of the
                                                Dutch Charge and the excesses of the Red Guards. On
                                                balance, we believe that Peking will accept
                                                responsibility for any Americans that it permits to
                                                enter. More important, its opportunities for
                                                harassment are almost as great today as they would
                                                be after restrictions were removed. We would, of
                                                course, issue a written warning of the risks to any
                                                American indicating an intention to travel to
                                                Communist China and could review at any time the
                                                desirability of a reimposition of travel
                                                restrictions if this seemed warranted.</item>

                                            <item>The complete removal of travel restrictions to
                                                Communist China would enable the Chinese to
                                                selectively invite individuals and their invitations
                                                might focus on persons who have extreme political
                                                views. This could well create a flow of traffic
                                                which might not only increase the ability of the
                                                Chinese to influence “left wing" political groups in
                                                the United States but also create a body of
                                                one-sided propaganda advocates for Peking in the
                                                U.S. who could boast they “had been there”. We
                                                believe that Peking would quickly find itself on
                                                untenable propaganda grounds if it pursued a policy
                                                of admitting only advocates of the “far left”. Their
                                                policy toward other countries has been to allow a
                                                reasonable cross-section of public opinion to visit
                                                the mainland even though they have attempted to
                                                channel visitors from the “left”. In any event it is
                                                now and will continue to be possible for American
                                                communists or other sympathizers with the Peking
                                                regime to clandestinely visit Communist China and
                                                return to the U.S. It is probably in the U.S.
                                                national interest to try and surface such visitors

                                                restrictions might be interpreted as a far more
                                                significant political move than the earlier partial
                                                relaxation of our travel restrictions and as
                                                indicating a qualitative shift in the U.S. attitude

                                                misinterpretation that we are changing our
                                                fundamental position on communist aggression. The
                                                Republic of China has expressed its misgivings about
                                                the relaxation in U.S. travel restrictions in the
                                                past but in a very low key. In the immediate context

                                        real foreign policy gain to be realized by removing the
                                        restriction on travel to China. In much of the world the
                                        U.S. is regarded as blind to the need of an <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0508"/>eventual accommodation with
                                        the most populous country of the world and one that will
                                        soon be a nuclear power. Our policy of resisting Chinese
                                        aggression is confused with an alleged policy of
                                        unwillingness to face the realities of the future power of
                                        China. We can eliminate this confusion and make clear our
                                        desire to reach an eventual accommodation with a
                                        non-belligerent Communist China by opening every avenue of
                                        peaceful relations that is consistent with our national
                                        security and our opposition to Chinese belligerence.
                                        Removing all prohibitions on travel of Americans to
                                        China—and thus assuming the same posture in this regard as
                                        the great majority of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> allies—would be an important step in that

                                    <item>Despite our liberal exceptions to the travel ban, at
                                        present in the eyes of much of the world we share with China
                                        the responsibility for preventing informal contacts. For
                                        example, Peking is reportedly telling foreign visitors that,
                                        by validating passports for travel to mainland China in a
                                        discriminatory manner, the United States is attempting to
                                        dictate to the Chinese whom they may invite to their
                                        country, and that the Chinese will not accept such
                                        dictation. This is obviously a subterfuge but, considering
                                        the breadth of our present exceptions to the travel
                                        restrictions, there would be very little cost in calling
                                        Peking's bluff by eliminating all restrictions on travel to
                                        that country. Only in this way can we make it wholly clear
                                        that mainland China's isolation is of its own making.</item>

                                    <item>To a surprising extent the American people and the
                                        Congress regard travel restrictions, not as a barometer of
                                        our feeling toward a country, but as an interference with an
                                        inherent right and freedom of American citizens. This has
                                        become apparent in the surprising Congressional opposition
                                        to the Willis and Eastland bills which were intended to
                                        impose penalties for violation of our travel restrictions.
                                        An explanation by the Department of State that we are
                                        recognizing and respecting the freedom of American citizens
                                        to travel abroad wherever they wish except where our foreign
                                        policy absolutely requires travel restrictions may very well
                                        prove to be entirely acceptable to a substantial majority of
                                        the public, the press and the Congress. Certainly there is
                                        reason to suspect resentment of the present situation where
                                        we authorize chosen categories of Americans to travel to
                                        China but forbid everyone else.</item>

                                    <item>This public justification for removing the restrictions
                                        ties in perfectly with the occasion presented by our new
                                        regulations. For the first time in these regulations we
                                        formally recognize significant limitations on our power to
                                        restrict travel in the interests of respecting the freedoms
                                        of American citizens. We could and would explain that, like
                                        Albania, Communist China was dropped from the restricted
                                        list simply because we could not meet the new strict
                                        criteria—i.e., we could not justify a continuing <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0509"/>imposition on the freedom
                                        of American citizens. This may well be an extremely popular
                                        approach.</item>

                                    <item>In addition, we would propose to explain it simply as a
                                        logical extension of the wide exceptions to the restrictions
                                        on travel to Communist China already in force and to
                                        emphasize that the dropping of these restrictions was
                                        completely consistent with the views already expressed by
                                        the President and yourself on the desirability of the freer
                                        exchange of ideas among nations and the U.S. hope that the
                                        Chinese will agree eventually to respond to these U.S.

                        <item>In the early 1950s the fundamental <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relationship was
                            established under circumstances in which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> appeared to be the only U.S. agency in a position to
                            assist the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in their ambitions, among
                            other things, to conduct operations against the Mainland. After the
                            Korean War, this assistance shifted from unproductive paramilitary
                            operations to the development of highly productive and valuable
                            technical operations involving communications intelligence and low and
                            high overhead reconnaissance aircraft flights. The development of these
                            very useful programs was facilitated by the position of Chiang Ching-kuo

                            belief that the Vietnam war might make possible their involvement in
                            some sort of counterattack, also contributed to the GRC's motivation in
                            cooperating with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in consolidating
                            and expanding the productive comint and overhead reconnaissance

                        <item>In 1964 the growth of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relationships began to level off and
                            then deteriorated slightly as <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            minimized its support to unproductive, infeasible <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Mainland operations, particularly
                            paramilitary, and reduced the size of its Taipei Station. While both
                            actions were taken essentially for reasons of marginal productivity,
                            tight budgets, and security, the GRC apparently chose to believe that
                            these actions were somehow connected with a larger U.S. intent to
                            “disengage”, which they seem to read as being reinforced by, among other
                            events, reductions in the Military Aid Program, and by the U.S. efforts
                            to prevent Chinese Communist involvement in the Vietnam war.
                            Nevertheless, the GRC maintained good fundamental relationships with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by continuing to give full
                            support to the critical comint and high overhead reconnaissance programs
                                <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0511"/>and by facilitating the

                        <item>In late 1965, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> determined that the
                            commercial passenger activities of the Civil Air Transport (<gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss>) airline should be terminated because
                                <gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss> was no longer essential to the

                            and was not intended to compete commercially with other airlines.
                            Although the intent to terminate <gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss> was
                            conveyed to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> through the <gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss> organization and was accompanied by
                            reassurances of assistance in establishing the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s own national flag air carrier, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has prolonged the phase-out
                            negotiations partly because they are aware of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s equity in <gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss> and
                            consider termination of <gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss>, again, as

                        <item>In mid-1966, the United States Intelligence Board decided the Grosbeak
                            program would be terminated because the product did not justify the risk
                            of crew losses and the men, money, and equipment involved could be
                            better used elsewhere in the context of the Vietnam war. This decision
                            was made after an extensive analysis of the program's value and was
                            conditioned by the fact that in the preceding two years only two
                            Grosbeak flights had been made. The two flights reflected <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            concern over crew losses versus the flight's product. Therefore, it was
                            calculated that, while the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might
                            challenge the termination decision as a further example of U.S.
                            “disengagement”, they would eventually accept it because they privately
                            and fundamentally did not want to make any more flights.</item>

                            reaction, expressed by <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName>, was to challenge directly <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s right to terminate an established
                            joint project and to demand a letter of termination intent before any
                            phase-out negotiations could be begun. This letter was delivered to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on 17 November and has not been
                            answered. Subsequent unilateral <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            actions have terminated a joint maritime collection team and the Joint
                            Operations Office without explanation. Neither activity is important to
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> collection interests. To date, the three critical
                            collection activities—comint, high-level reconnaissance, and

                        <item>An analysis of the reasons for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s adverse reaction to the Grosbeak termination strongly
                            suggests that their reaction was not motivated solely by the Grosbeak
                            decision. Rather their reaction is motivated partly by their strong
                            pique at the U.S., particularly for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s very lukewarm response to their resurrected ambitious
                            paramilitary schemes directed at the Mainland's turmoil, and partly by
                            their distrust of U.S. intentions in the recent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Chirep action. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            adverse reaction has been further conditioned by their recognition that
                            the special relationship <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0512"/>with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, which they believed existed as
                            a means of facilitating ambitions with or without reference to U.S.
                            policies, was in reality a relationship fully and officially governed on
                            the U.S. side by U.S. interests and needs as determined by the
                            policy-making levels of the government.</item>

                        <item>A forecast of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s likely further
                            action bearing on its joint activities with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is difficult to make because of the variety of the
                            governing factors. It is anticipated, though, that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s action will be less adverse than

                            by moving against one of the three critical activities. In any case, it

                            adversely against any of the three critical activities except as a

                            break in state relations; the Soviets are apprehensive about the costs
                            of such a development within the Communist movement and the Chinese
                            probably fear its possible impact on Hanoi.</item>

                        <item>Even so, we cannot completely exclude a sudden explosion of the
                            dispute into a new and more virulent form in the near term. The
                            Vietnamese war has added to the uncertainties and the urgency of the
                            dispute, the emotions of the principals involved could come to have
                            greater relevance, and unplanned incidents could provoke greater
                            hostility and more forceful retaliations. Moreover, the situation in
                            China is fluid; it is possible that domestic requirements or pressures
                            might cause the leadership to force a severance of all remaining
                            vestiges of contact with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>In the longer term, prospects for major changes leading either to a
                            further deterioration or an easing of the dispute appear to rest mainly
                            on what happens in China after <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>. The emergence of a Chinese regime even more
                            anti-Soviet than its predecessor is certainly one of the possibil-ities.
                            In this event, hostility could reach new levels of intensity. All forms
                            of cooperation, including even the transit across China of Soviet
                            supplies for North Vietnam's war effort might cease. Though serious
                            military incidents along the Sino-Soviet border are also possible, both
                            sides would almost certainly seek to avoid war.</item>

                        <item>The emergence of a more flexible leadership in Peking could lead to
                            some easing of tensions. We do not believe that any Chinese regime would
                            offer the Soviets substantial concessions, but in exchange for certain
                            benefits, such as renewed economic and military assistance, new Chinese
                            leaders might be willing to damp down the dispute. Even a limited
                            Sino-Soviet rapprochement would be likely to have some important effects
                            on the international scene since world opinion has come to expect active
                            discord between the two. An easing of the dispute could also lead to
                            greater Sino-Soviet harmony vis-a-vis the Vietnamese war, assuming its
                            continuation.</item>

                        <item>Nevertheless, any Sino-Soviet rapprochement in either the short or
                            longer term is likely to have definite limits. We expect little or no
                            positive cooperation at the party level and a continuing general
                            atmosphere of barely suppressed suspicion and mistrust. Moreover, the
                            Sino-Soviet relationship would remain highly vulnerable to clashes of
                            national interests over a broad range of issues, and if China's power
                            began to give punch to its national assertiveness, serious trouble could
                            develop, particularly over the frontiers.</item>

                        <item>The Sino-Soviet dispute has greatly intensified in recent months.
                            Peking has stepped up the frequency and fury of its attacks on the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moscow, which for almost two
                            years sought to convey an image of reason and restraint in the dispute,
                            has since August begun to reply forcefully in kind. China accuses the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of acting in collusion with
                            the US, and Moscow charges that Peking serves the imperialist cause by
                            refusing to cooperate with the rest of the Communist world. China claims
                            that the Soviet leadership is deliberately transforming the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into a bourgeois society, Moscow
                            asserts that current developments and policies in China have “nothing in
                            common with Marxism-Leninism.” And each side now publicly contends that
                            the other is beyond redemption so long as its present leaders are in
                            control.</item>

                        <item>Hostility between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Communist China has, of course, existed for many years. Serious, though
                            concealed, differences arose even during periods of relative harmony in
                            Stalin's time, and open antagonism dates back at least to 1960. The
                            reasons for Sino-Soviet friction and for the long decline in the
                            relationship are complex, and over the years a substantial number of
                            issues have been involved in the dispute. Underlying everything have
                            been conflicts of national interest and ambition, some of a largely
                            traditional nature, such as Sino-Russian competition in Mongolia and
                            Korea, and others which have assumed a largely Communist character, such
                            as the rivalry for political and ideological preeminence within the
                            “socialist world.” Different stages of internal <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0515"/>development and great disparities in
                            wealth and power have helped to create conflicting attitudes and a
                            general feeling of ill will between the two countries. Doctrinal
                            disagreements and quarrels over Communist strategy, cultural
                            antipathies, and even personal enmities (as between Khrushchev and Mao)
                            have all played important roles. Certain key moves made in the dispute
                            have also stimulated discord and helped to give the contest a momentum
                            of its own: for example, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                            refusal in the late 1950's to satisfy China's demands for the
                            wherewithal to achieve a nuclear weapons capability, and Peking's
                            decision in the same period to challenge Moscow's dominance in the
                            Bloc.</item>

                        <item>Three developments appear to have contributed the most to the current
                            sharpening of the dispute. First, China's internal quarrels have been
                            accompanied by the mounting violence in polemical attacks on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its adherents in the movement.
                            The campaign against domestic revisionists and anti-Maoists, part of an
                            apparent struggle within the Chinese leadership, has evidently
                            encouraged comparable attacks on <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s principal enemies abroad as well. Secondly,
                            China's growing isolation within the Communist movement—it is now
                            virtually without significant allies—has frustrated and embittered
                            Peking, and this seems to have reinforced its determination to remain
                            arrogant and intransigent vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Finally, the war in Vietnam has become a key area of
                            dissension, since it involves the most fundamental differences over
                            Communist strategy and tactics.</item>

                        <item>The present Soviet leaders decided late in 1964, shortly after their
                            assumption of power, that Soviet policy toward China was sorely in need
                            of repair. They apparently believed that Khrushchev had caused
                            unnecessary damage to Soviet prestige and leadership of the Communist
                            movement by his insistence on engaging polemically with Peking and his
                            efforts to commit other parties to a formal repudiation of Chinese
                            views. They did not wish to compromise the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s basic political and ideological position in the
                            dispute, and probably had no strong expectation that relations with
                            China could be significantly improved. But they did hope that a new
                            approach could reverse growing support for the Chinese within the
                            movement and eventually help to isolate Peking from the rest of the
                            Communist world.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>To this end, Khrushchev's successors acted with calculated restraint,
                            avoiding polemics, retreating from demands for an anti-Chinese
                            international Communist conference, and, in general, seeking to shift
                            the blame for the continuing dispute onto Peking. At the same time,
                            partly to disprove Chinese charges of Soviet unreliability and softness,
                            and partly to contest actively with Peking for influence in Hanoi, they
                            also sought to reestablish the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                            credentials as a major Asian power and publicly committed themselves to
                            increase their support of North <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0516"/>Vietnam. And, in support of this general line, they placed stricter
                            limits on negotiations with the West and reintroduced a number of
                            cold-war themes into their propaganda.</item>

                        <item>The Chinese Communists seem initially to have misread Khrushchev's
                            fall from power as a blow against revisionism and as a further
                            vindication of their own harsh revolutionary line. They soon rebuffed
                            the efforts of the new Soviet leadership to mute polemics, and were
                            apparently unprepared for the effectiveness of the new Soviet tactics.
                            They were also unprepared for the series of setbacks they encountered
                            abroad: for example, the failure of their efforts to form an Afro-Asian
                            front in 1965 without Soviet participation, highlighted by the fiasco
                            over the Algiers conference; the loss of their position in Indonesia;
                            the characterization of their trade policies by the previously friendly
                            Castro as political blackmail; and, in general, their growing
                            unpopularity among Afro-Asian neutralists.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Chinese became aware that things were going against them and that
                            some of their early supporters, such as the Japanese Communists and the
                            North Koreans, were beginning to drift away from their camp. But rather
                            than change course, they persisted in unyielding policies and insisted
                            that “temporary set-backs" could not deflect them from long-term
                            objectives. Even their growing vulnerability to Soviet allegations that
                            only China stood in the way of unified Communist support for North
                            Vietnam did not persuade them to modify policies. Last spring, in fact,
                            Peking adopted a domestic line which could hardly have been fashioned to
                            do it more harm in the movement or render it more susceptible to Soviet
                            ridicule and cries of alarm. Indeed, all of the world's Communist
                            Parties have been mystified by the course of events in China, and
                            virtually all have been alienated by the antiparty aspects of Red Guard
                            rampages, the appearances of Maoist megalomania and Chinese chauvinism,
                            and the general turmoil which seems to have swept over China.</item>

                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China today
                            find it difficult to maintain even the pretense of a meaningful
                            political and military alliance. Party contacts practically do not
                            exist. State relations are minimal, formal, and often not polite.
                            Cultural contacts are kept up, but on a very small scale. Trade, which
                            reached a peak of over $2 billion in 1959, sank to about $400 million
                            last year and will probably decline even further this year. Only
                            negligible quantities of military supplies are still shipped from the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, principally certain spare
                            parts contracted for earlier and items of equipment which the Chinese
                            could produce themselves or obtain elsewhere. The 1950 Treaty of
                            Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has not been formally
                            renounced, but both sides have expressed doubt as to its continuing
                            validity; Peking has indicated that it does not count on—or even
                            necessarily want—Soviet military assistance, <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0517"/>and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            clearly implied that in many circumstances it would not feel at all
                            bound to extend such assistance. The two countries do not even cooperate
                            easily or well on problems associated with the provision of military
                            assistance to North Vietnam. Peking has in various ways hampered the
                            delivery of Soviet equipment to North Vietnam.</item>

                        <item>The Situation on the Border. Tension has existed along the Sino-Soviet
                            frontier since at least 1962 (when some 50,000 border tribesmen in
                            Sinkiang, apparently stirred up by the Soviets, emigrated en masse to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>). Since 1963, Moscow has
                            undertaken some modest reinforcement of its military and security forces
                            in regions near China, especially opposite Sinkiang and eastern
                            Manchuria. It has also stepped up its military assistance to Mongolia
                            and this year began the construction of an air defense system in that
                            country. The Chinese have apparently begun to give some attention to air
                            defenses in areas of Sinkiang bordering the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They have also sought to impose stiff new regulations
                            governing the use of border rivers and have apparently harassed the
                            Soviets along the land frontiers as well.</item>

                        <item>Condition of the Communist Movement. Sino-Soviet rivalry within the
                            world Communist movement is still bitter and intense. The Chinese
                            glorify Mao, vilify the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and
                            define their views as “universal truth;” the Soviets allow the Chinese
                            to discredit themselves in this way and try, for the most part
                            successfully, to block Peking's maneuvers. The character of this
                            competition, however, has changed greatly over the past two years. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must still reckon with the
                            split, partly because of the maneuverability it gives parties which are
                            anxious to avoid Soviet domination, and partly because a number of
                            parties maintain a neutral posture in the dispute, including, most
                            notably, the North Vietnamese. But while Moscow was confronted only two
                            years ago with a serious challenge to its leadership, today it faces a
                            China which can count on full support only from Albania, the Communist
                            Party of New Zealand, a handful of tiny splinter groups, and a small
                            number of front groups which are obviously Chinese controlled.</item>

                        <item>Impact of the Vietnamese War. The Soviets have increasingly sought to
                            use the Vietnamese war as an issue against China. They have charged, for
                            example, that Peking's failure to cooperate had prolonged the war by
                            preventing a “quick end" to US “outrages.” And they have employed their
                            aid to North Vietnam as a means to increase their influence in Hanoi at
                            Chinese expense, and in this they have apparently had some success. But
                            while thus offering the Soviets an effective tool to use against the
                            Chinese, the war also tends to limit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s maneuverability in the dispute. Moscow must contend
                            with Hanoi's refusal to choose sides, which means also that North
                            Vietnam is unwilling to accept Soviet political guidance on the conduct
                            of the war. Moreover, Chinese control <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0518"/>over direct land and air supply routes to North Vietnam
                            is a factor limiting Soviet influence in Hanoi.</item>

                        <item>The eventual outcome of the war will clearly have a major bearing on
                            the further course of the Sino-Soviet quarrel. The Soviet attitude
                            toward the war appears to be mixed. The effect it has had in imposing
                            strains on American resources and burdens on American relations with
                            Europe and friendly countries elsewhere must be seen as advantageous. On
                            the other hand, the Soviets are aware also that the situation carries
                            some risk of direct confrontation which, in that area and under present
                            circumstances, they must wish to avoid. For them, the optimum outcome
                            would be one which, by a political process perhaps including a
                            negotiation, gave Hanoi a good prospect of achieving its aims in South
                            Vietnam and thus inflicted a major reverse on US policy. Evidently the
                            Soviets do not think that the moment has yet come when they can set in
                            motion a scenario which would end in this way. But should they be able
                            to, in the face of continuing Chinese opposition to a political
                            solution, they would strike a major blow at Peking's influence among the
                            Asian Communists which would also go far to reestablish Moscow's
                            ascendancy throughout the Communist movement.</item>

                            dictatorship. Some rise in the frequency, though probably not the
                            magnitude, of incidents along the Sino-Soviet border also seems likely.
                            Continued difficulties associated with the transit across China of
                            Soviet supplies for Vietnam seem almost certain. Forced reductions in
                            the size of diplomatic missions are possible. But we do not foresee a
                            deliberate formal rupture in state relations between the two countries;
                            the Soviets will probably remain generally apprehensive about its
                            possible costs in the movement, and the Chinese will probably continue

                            obstructionism. But the Soviets know that many parties, though hostile
                            to Peking, would not favor an international conference explicitly called
                            for that purpose, or any enterprise which threatened to expel the

                            generally. It might, however, have some effects on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s foreign policies. We do not believe
                            that growing Sino-Soviet friction automatically assures a commensurate

                            become more and more isolated and discredited, the Soviets have become
                            less sensitive to Chinese accusations and perhaps less responsive to
                            Chinese pressures for militancy. Since August, for example, there have

                            has become more interested in some movement in its relations with the
                            US. In any case, as a simple matter of prudence, Moscow's inclination to
                            avoid crises in the <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0520"/>West would
                            probably be reinforced by a fear of possible major difficulties in the

                        <item>We cannot completely exclude a sudden explosion of the dispute into a
                            new and even more virulent form, even in the near term. The Vietnamese
                            war has added to the uncertainties and has no doubt increased the sense
                            of urgency associated with the contest. The emotions of the chief actors
                            in the dispute could come to have even greater relevance, and unplanned
                            incidents could provoke even greater hostility and lead to new forms of
                            mutual retaliation. Moreover, the internal situation in China is fluid;
                            it is possible that domestic requirements or pressures might cause the

                                but both sides would almost certainly seek to avoid war. China
                                probably would be constrained by its military inferiority and the

                                of the dispute, as did Khrushchev's. But <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s departure from the scene and
                                his replacement by a more flexible leadership would not heal all the
                                wounds or remove basic issues. The Chinese leadership as a whole—not

                                extensive technical, economic, and especially military assistance.
                                More important, any conceivable new leadership in Peking is likely
                                to retain strong feelings about Chinese national independence,
                                cultural and ideological superiority, and perhaps racial superiority
                                as well. Divergent Chinese and Soviet national interests are likely

                            establishment of Sino-Soviet cooperation in a number of ways. It would
                            probably receive military supplies somewhat faster and perhaps in
                            greater quantity; the establishment in China of supply bases for Soviet
                            materiel, for example, would expedite shipment and perhaps allow an
                            improvement in the mix of weapons delivered. Finally, a greater degree
                            of unity would give Hanoi's political statements and warnings somewhat
                            more force than in the past.</item>

                            <p>Even a very limited rapprochement between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China would be
                                likely to have an effect on the international scene as a whole.
                                World opinion has come to expect active discord between the two, and
                                world politics rests in part on the assumption of its continuation.
                                The changes in opinion and politics which would probably flow from
                                any such adjustment in the Sino-Soviet relationship, however, are
                                not easily foreseen. They might be subtle and very gradual: a slow
                                renewal of confidence within the Communist movement, for example, or
                                a growth of anxiety in Europe about the USSR's intentions in the
                                West, now that its frontiers in the East were more “secure.” Or they
                                could be more substantial, as in Vietnam, and perhaps as in India,
                                which might fear that any trend toward Sino-Soviet harmony would
                                seriously threaten its security interests. Some of these effects
                                would probably be present even though, as we believe likely, a
                                limited rapprochement failed to hide all evidence of continuing
                                basic differences and clashes of interests.</p>

                        <item>Over the long term, to the extent that China proved successful in
                            realizing economic, technical, and military progress, Soviet fears of a
                            strong China on its borders are likely to grow. The prospect of a
                            powerful China is probably some way off in Soviet calculations, and
                            would not, in any case, necessarily prevent Moscow from seeking to
                            normalize relations. But it would serve, we think, to limit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s inclination to consider China as an
                            ally and to reinforce other alternatives in Soviet foreign policy. These
                            alternatives will probably include continuing interest in good relations
                            with Japan and India, as potential checkmates to Chinese influence in
                            Asia, and, over time, a more urgent interest in a European
                            settlement.</item>
                        <label>30.</label>
                        <item>On the Chinese side, while changes in the regime and its policies may
                            produce an interest in normalizing relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in order to obtain economic and
                            military assistance, Peking is not likely to be willing to pay much of a
                            political price for such aid. It almost certainly would not accept
                            Soviet leadership in the world Communist movement, renounce its
                            traditional interests in border areas, or forgo its claims to a leading
                            role in both Asian and world affairs. China's requirements, political
                            and economic, are likely to cause any non-Maoist successor regime to
                            look to Japan and the West as the major source of the necessary capital
                            and technology for China's development.</item>
                        <label>31.</label>
                        <item>Thus, while we believe that the Sino-Soviet relationship could come to
                            be characterized by improved state-to-state relationships and a
                            relaxation in the bitter ideological struggle, we expect little or no
                            positive cooperation at the party level and a continuing general
                            atmosphere of barely suppressed suspicion and mistrust. Moreover, the
                            relationship would remain highly vulnerable to clashes of national
                            interest over a <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0523"/>broad range of
                            issues, and if China's power began to give punch to its national
                            assertiveness, serious trouble could develop, particularly over the
                            frontiers.</item>

                    <p>13023. Secto 35. Eyes only for the President and the Acting Secretary. There
                        was no major surprise in my brief visit in Taipei. It was clear that spirits
                        had been greatly boosted by the good vote in the United Nations. I
                        encountered no complaints or recriminations from any officials, including
                        President <persName>Chiang</persName>, about our handling of the matters or
                        about our vote for the Italian resolution.</p>
                    <p>Before my arrival the South Vietnamese had put in some requests for
                        additional assistance from the Republic of China and I found a generally
                        sympathetic attitude on the part of officials in Taipei. It seems to me that
                        this is now a matter of expediting specific arrangements and getting Chinese
                        technical personnel in position to go to work.</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Chiang</persName> spoke at considerable length about the
                        mainland, details of which will be furnished through memorandum of
                        conversation. He expressed concern to see the problem of Taipei become
                        involved in the problem of Viet-Nam. Apparently, he had in mind the
                        possibility that if the two were intermingled, concessions would be made to
                        Peking with respect to Taipei in exchange for peace in Viet-Nam. This led
                        him to indicate that it would be a mistake for Chinese combat troops to be
                        in Viet-Nam but I was not completely clear that he might not have been
                        fishing for a request for such troops from me.</p>
                    <p>More interestingly, he developed at some length the thesis that he, his
                        government and his armed forces are considered by Peking to be their no. 1
                        enemy. He said that in the “past few days" he had become concerned about the
                        possibility that Peking would launch a nuclear strike on <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0524"/>Formosa with “ten or twelve weapons" and
                        reduce that island to ashes. He said that Peking would probably feel that
                        the Americans might not retaliate because world opinion would consider that
                        Peking has a perfect right to bomb a part of its own territory but that, in
                        any event, Peking would expect to survive any such retaliation and its main
                        enemy on Formosa would be gone. I told him that I would not wish to comment
                        offhand on such a serious and far-reaching matter, that I did not believe
                        the contingency he had in mind would in fact occur although no one can
                        guarantee what the future might hold, that such developments seemed to me to
                        lie in the realm of the insane and irrational, but that the U.S. considered
                        its Mutual Security Treaty with the Republic of China fully in effect. I did
                        not draw him out on what conclusions he drew from his fears because I rather
                        thought that he would immediately recommend a first strike against mainland
                        Chinese nuclear installations.</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Chiang</persName> rather expects that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> will establish their full control
                        on the mainland and will follow a militant policy dangerous to all of
                        us.</p>
                    <p>I was once again tremendously impressed with the performance of the Republic
                        of China on Formosa and I am bringing back some quite exciting material
                        about their technical assistance to other countries which will be useful for
                        Congressional briefings as a good sample of how a successful aid program can
                        multiply itself in many directions.</p>

                        <p>The Gimo asked if the Soviets ever interpret to US officials events in
                            Communist China. The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is always unwilling to talk about the Chicoms.
                            On one occasion the Secretary had asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what is happening on the China mainland.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had replied that to
                            tell the truth he did not know. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that there is now an element of
                            irrationality in Peiping, and this irrationality makes it difficult to
                            interpret events.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wished to tell the Gimo in great confidence
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had once observed
                            with regret that there is no provision in the Test Ban Treaty to enforce
                            its provisions on non-signer nations. The Secretary said that the US
                            would follow up this remark, and it is a very important development that
                            the Soviets should worry about the Chicoms in this connection.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had once asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> whether, in the event that Hanoi did come to the
                            conference table, the ChiComs would intervene with military force to
                            prevent Hanoi from making peace. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had replied that that would be
                            inconceivable.</p>

                            Paras 2–4 reiterate general US policy in Asia and toward Peking. Paras
                            5–7 discuss our policy in Southeast Asia and the Manila Conference. Para
                            8 expresses the hope that Peking will subscribe to the Treaty on the
                            Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Paras 9–10 discuss communication with and
                            travel to Communist China. Paras 11–17 include a major review of our
                            position on the Americans still being held by Peking. Paras 18–24
                            respond to anticipated ChiCom accusations against the US for
                            provocations and alleged incidents against ChiCom territory and ships.
                            In Para 26 we suggest that the next meeting take place between March 22
                            and April 12.</item>

                        <item>The major contingency we have allowed for is that Peking will take the
                            initiative to move the talks or to suspend them. Paras 27–34 provide
                            guidance for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>
                            in dealing with several alternative actions the Chinese might take. I
                            call your attention particularly to the proposal in Para 32 that we
                            offer to hold a higher-level meeting (at the Under-Secretary level) with
                            the Chinese in the event they move to suspend or break the talks. A

                            <item>The basic purpose of suggesting a higher-level (Deputy Under

                                Communists, in the event of a move by the latter to suspend the
                                Ambassadorial level talks, is to further assure that world public
                                opinion unequivocally understands that the breakdown in
                                communications is the responsibility of the Chinese. We strongly
                                doubt Peking would agree (they publicly denounced a suggestion by
                                Senator Mansfield earlier this year for a US-ChiCom Foreign Minister
                                conference). Acceptance by the Chinese would strengthen the
                                impression Peking may be most anxious to avoid, that the ChiComs are
                                acting in collusion with the US.</item>

                                merits, could further our communications with the Chinese in terms
                                of peace in Southeast Asia and increased understanding of the basic

                        East he had spent some time in Taipei and while there had had a two hour
                        talk with <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, the
                        Generalissimo's son.<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">An unsigned December 15
                            memorandum to <persName>Bundy</persName> conveyed the text of a cable
                            report from Colby, who met with <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> on December 12. (Ibid., China, 1966)</note>
                        Most of the talk had had to do with the suspension/cancellation of the
                        Grosbeak operation and Chiang, Mr. <persName>Colby</persName> said, had
                        given it to him with “both barrels.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that during his own recent visit he too
                        had been put under fire by Chiang, on the same cause.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Colby</persName> went on to recount some of the details of his
                        own experience. <persName>Chiang</persName> had asserted that cessation of
                        the operation was “unacceptable”, and he rejected flatly as unnecessary Mr.
                            <persName>Colby</persName>'s thought that perhaps representatives of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the US might conduct a joint
                        review of the matter and the effectiveness of the Grosbeak operation. The
                        decision to end the exercise, <persName>Chiang</persName> said, was his
                        reward for having relied upon the United States and particularly on <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        had lost some 120 men in the Grosbeak incursions and he simply could not see
                        how, with that investment in human lives, he could confront his Air Force
                        with the decision to end the program. It was with extreme difficulty that he
                        had succeeded in establishing tenuous authority over the older army
                        generals; he had achieved this only by pointing to Air Force support, and
                        the decision to suspend thus would cost him not only Air Force fealty but
                        also would thereby gravely endanger his position with the Army.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> here interjected that this was a pretty
                        serious comment on the solidity of <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName>'s authority, and Mr. <persName>Colby</persName>
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines of source text) not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>Further, the Grosbeak decision had come on top of a number of other
                        depressants. There had been a turn-down of General Yeh's list of proposals
                            <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0530"/>for operations against the
                        mainland, there had been the abrasions of the Chirep issue in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this year, there had been the withdrawal of
                        F–104's from Taiwan, etc. The effects were becoming noticeable. The
                        Nationalists were no longer pushing the idea of a joint <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-US intelligence office, or of a joint
                        planning group to consider actions against the mainland. Nationalist cooling
                        on these, Mr. <persName>Colby</persName> said, was some cause for relief. A
                        slow-down in U–2 operations could be considered as slightly more serious,
                        but only if there were a choking off the SI operations on the island would
                        we suffer palpable damage to our intelligence interests. Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Colby</persName> went on to say that from <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>'s point of view recent
                        developments had been unfortunate, but that it was time he faced up to
                        issues. It was important that his thinking be brought back to the realm of
                        the real world and off the level of fantasy, and that ideas of invading the
                        mainland and reassuming control there be abandoned. Bringing the
                        Nationalists to face reality was bound to be a laborious and difficult
                        process, but it was necessary.</p>

                            <p>It is <persName>Wang</persName>'s turn to open. We anticipate rigid
                                and hard presentation from him focusing on allegations of US
                                provocations against Chinese territory, ships, and ChiCom Embassy in
                                Hanoi. <persName>Wang</persName> will almost certainly refer to
                                Vietnam and the increase in US forces and may refer to US alleged
                                intention to further “escalate" war by sending B–52s to Thailand. He
                                will probably repeat ChiCom intentions to “fight side by side" with
                                Vietnamese but we doubt he will make more specific ChiCom threat of
                                intervention. <persName>Wang</persName> may also return to point
                                made at last meeting that <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0531"/>US-Soviets colluding on Vietnam and against ChiComs. We believe we
                                must respond to some but not all these allegations. Wang may refer
                                to US press reports of our offer at last meeting to exchange seed
                                samples and again charge US violation of integrity of talks in
                                effort to forestall comment by us on his unilateral publication of
                                opening statement at last meeting. It possible that
                                    <persName>Wang</persName> may again move to release text of his
                                opening statement after present meeting in order to further degrade
                                significance of meetings and provide ChiComs with defense against
                                Soviet innuendos at US-ChiCom collusion. We also do not exclude
                                possibility that the Chinese side may take an initiative to propose
                                a shift in the talks to another site. Even more seriously, they
                                could take some action to suspend the talks although current
                                evidence continues suggest they still find these meetings of some
                                value. We have, however, included specific contingency guidance for
                                such developments. Following is approved guidance for your opening
                                presentation.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In view rumors circulating over
                            last few months of ChiCom desire move talks to Rangoon or elsewhere from
                            Warsaw, believe we should be prepared respond to any ChiCom initiative
                            this regard but should not ourselves at present time take initiative to
                            suggest change in venue if ChiComs do not raise subject. Following is
                            contingent guidance in event issue arises:</item>
                        <label>28.</label>
                        <item>If ChiComs suggest move in acceptable manner either during regular
                            meeting or in private discussions afterwards, you should probe as far as
                            possible for their motivations in suggesting change and their suggested
                            alternatives for meeting site and agree take subject under advisement
                            without indicating US reaction. Our present thinking is that we would be
                            willing move talks in order obtain greater security of contact if
                            agreement could be reached on mutually acceptable site. We will want,
                            however, to consider our specific response to ChiComs in context their
                            approach.</item>
                        <label>29.</label>
                        <item>We do not exclude possibility ChiComs may wish find some way to
                            suspend present series of meetings without accepting public
                            responsibility for breaking contact. One approach could be direct move
                            to suspend talks on pretext that they unable talk with us in Warsaw
                            while we “bombing" their Embassy in Hanoi. Alternative might be to
                            launch ad hominem attack on you (as suggested by Geneva's 1466 rptd
                            Warsaw Deptel 80795)<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">See <ref target="#d208fn2">footnote 2, Document 208</ref>.</note> and
                            refuse further discussions while you US representative.</item>
                        <label>30.</label>
                        <item>Basic US objective is to maintain Ambassadorial contact with ChiComs
                            if this at all possible but, if talks suspended, to endeavor place
                            responsibility for suspension clearly on ChiComs. If ChiComs express <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0532"/>intention suspend talks on
                            basis US bombing their Embassy in Hanoi, you should first reject their
                            charges along lines para 22 above, refuse accept such charges as pretext
                            for suspending talks, emphasize US willingness and desire continue
                            meetings, and continue with presentation of guidance. If ChiComs
                            indicate intention walk out of meeting or refuse agree to set date for
                            next meeting, you should emphasize seriousness of move, emphasize
                            importance of maintaining communication in times of stress citing 1958
                            and 1962 Taiwan Strait crises as examples, urge them reconsider, and, if
                            they persist in their position, express deep US regret and your
                            intention make statement to press on subject. Press statement should
                            follow line outlined in this para. Specific language left to your
                            discretion in particular context of ChiCom action.</item>
                        <label>31.</label>
                        <item>If ChiComs lodge personal attack on you, we would expect you strongly
                            repudiate charges, emphasize unprecedented nature of accusation, and
                            demand an explanation for ChiCom action. We believe you should then
                            complete delivery of prepared guidance but move immediately thereafter
                            to end meeting and suggest date for next meeting if ChiComs in rebuttal
                            return to their allegations against you. We would propose two week
                            interval on this occasion and emphasize that purpose of this to provide
                            opportunity for ChiComs to reconsider allegations they have made.
                            Emphasize as in para 29 above US desire continue talks and willingness
                            do so in Warsaw or elsewhere if there genuine and reasonable grounds for
                            shifting site but that such discussions cannot take place in context
                            unjustifiable accusations made by <persName>Wang</persName>.</item>
                        <label>32.</label>
                        <item>We anticipate that if the ChiComs have decided to suspend the talks
                            there is little we can do to affect their decision other than maximize
                            their embarrassment. We would assume such a ChiCom decision would be
                            based on their desire be relieved of political embarrassment of dealing
                            with US in confidential talks at same time that they attack Soviets for
                            doing same thing and warn Hanoi against negotiating with US.</item>
                        <label>33.</label>
                        <item>If ChiComs choose break or suspend talks, approaches outlined above
                            obviously do not exhaust possibilities. We cannot provide you with
                            exhaustive responses to all possible ChiCom gambits but believe line
                            outlined above provides sufficient general guidance handle other
                            situations which may arise.</item>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s regime is in serious
                        difficulty, to a degree that civil war has become a distinct
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>Months of growing chaos in the top leadership are now followed by widespread
                        resistance to pro-Mao elements in Central, South and East China, as
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s Red Guards and other
                        “rebel" groups have attempted to move the Cultural Revolution to farms and
                        factories. You have noted reports of violent clashes in Canton, Foochow,
                        Shanghai, Nanking, the Chusan Islands and Peking itself, and of the
                        breakdown of rail service in several sectors. In Nanking large-scale arrests
                        (apparently of pro-Mao elements!) by Army and public security forces have
                        been reported.</p>
                    <p>The source of most of our information on this highly confused situation
                        remains press reports of “wall newspapers" in Peking. However, both Peking
                        and Shanghai broadcasts have now confirmed serious resistance, and have
                        warned of adverse effects on production. At the same time the Peking
                        broadcast insists “It is an erroneous point of view that the Great Cultural
                        Revolution antagonizes the development of production!" <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> forces are evidently determined to go
                        through with their attempted “proletarianization" of the nation despite
                        mounting costs now threatening the regime itself.</p>
                    <p>Most of the clashes have occurred in areas where Propaganda Chief T'ao Chu,
                        number four in the Peking hierarchy, retains strong support of the party
                        machinery. Much of this resistance has doubtless been triggered by recent
                        official attacks on T'ao, principally on the part of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s wife. Attacks on T'ao were probably
                        in turn prompted by his attempts to protect provincial party cadre who are
                        opposing the Mao-Lin line.</p>
                    <p>The battle is clearly drawn. On <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>'s side appear to be: <list>
                            <item>—a small and seemingly dwindling minority in the party;</item>
                            <item>—probably the bulk of the seriously divided Red Guards; and</item>
                            <item>—an indeterminate percentage of the armed forces.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ranged against these are, apparently: <list>
                            <item>—the bulk of both the leadership and the lesser party
                                apparatus;</item>
                            <item>—a goodly portion of the worker groups so far tested by Red Guard
                                revolutionary activity; and</item>
                            <item>—an unknown portion of the Army.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0534"/>
                    <p>Much more resistance from workers and peasants seems sure to come, as
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s revolution is carried
                        further into the provinces.</p>
                    <p>The big question mark is the direction in which the Army will finally lend
                        its predominant support. It cannot stand aside much longer, if present chaos
                        continues. If it proves to be as divided as other major elements of the
                        nation have been, the “<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> dynasty"
                        is in for more bloody convulsions, and almost certain demise.</p>
                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> remains the best hope of
                        achieving a compromise in the interest of preserving the nation and the
                        regime's hard-won, limited accomplishments. However, <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has made his war one of veritable
                        “religious" fervor, and compromise now appears highly unlikely. We must
                        expect one side or the other to win out. As of now the anti-Mao forces
                        appear the stronger, and gaining. It is curious that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s heir apparent, <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>, has not appeared since November
                        26. Mao-Lin interests in Peking appear to have been left primarily in Madame
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s hands, and the precarious
                        condition of those interests is underlined today by wall posters announcing
                        the dissolution of the capital's anti-Mao public security forces,
                        and—perhaps the most significant straw in today's East wind—other posters
                        accusing National Defense Council Member, General Liu Chih-chien, of siding
                        with the anti-Maoists.</p>

                        <p>Today's events in China have a dynastic rather than communistic flavor.
                            Politically, the period is that of the first great Chinese dynasty—the
                            Han, but it is not clear whether we are watching its formation and the
                            death agonies of the Ch'in or are seeing the end of the Han when the
                            empire was swept with the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans, a rebellion
                            which was in turn suppressed, but left the nation divided among a number
                            of regional chieftains. A novel of this latter epoch begins, “Empires
                            wax and wane, states fall apart and then reunite.” After seventeen years
                            of unity China is beginning to feel again the shudders which foretell
                            political change.</p>
                        <p>Between mid-December and mid-January the political turmoil spread by the
                            cultural revolution churned in dozens of areas, leaving the onlooker
                            dazed. Nevertheless the basic divisions become much clearer. <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0538"/>[<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] there is no longer doubt of the
                            power struggle between <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> on one hand and Liu
                            Shao Ch'i and Teng Hsiao-P'ing on the other; we have learned of the
                            Central Committee Meeting in October (which lasted 17 days) and to which
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> made two remarkable speeches. We
                            have heard Lin compare <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                            struggle to keep control of the Central Committee to Stalin's struggle
                            for power, and admit that the bourgeois advocates in the Central
                            Committee remain in the dominant position in a number of fields.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> in turn admits to great
                            loss of control in the party, but makes it clear that he intends to
                            grasp full power again whatever the cost. We heard that at Christmas
                            time <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> tried finally to
                            crush the opposition and intrigued with T'Ao Chu to bring the great
                            regional satraps, Li Ching-Ch'uan from the southwest, Liu Lan-T'ao from
                            the northwest, and Sung Jen-Ch'iung from Manchuria to Peking, supposedly
                            to reach a compromise. Accepting Tao's pledge of safety they came. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>'s proposals were not
                            accepted, and he then ordered their arrest. T'Ao Chu then made his
                            choice. Standing behind his word, T'ao arranged the departure of the
                            three from Peking secretly by air and Lin's plot failed. T'ao, then
                            ranked fourth in the party hierarchy, was excommunicated and immediately
                            attacked. By mid-January he had apparently lost all his positions in the
                            party.</p>
                        <p>Throughout early January the Mao-Lin position was increasingly attacked.
                            To counter this, new “revolutionary rebel headquarters" have appeared in
                            Shanghai, Foochow, Tsinan and Peking—all areas dominated by
                            Army-controlled subordinates of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin
                                Piao</persName> from the days when he commanded the Fourth Field
                            Army and its predecessor forces. These new rebel headquarters are set up
                            to seize control of vital communication links, the post and telegraph
                            services, the railways, radio and the newspapers. The magic name of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Tse-Tung</persName> still holds great
                            strength, and in Shanghai two newspapers become the voice for these new
                            cultural revolution vanguards. Hasty attempts were made to remove the
                            party command of the all China Federation of Trade Unions and pack it
                            with supporters of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>. Liu Ning-I, long
                            China's No. 1 labor man (after Liu Shao-Ch'i) came under attack, and
                            open clashes broke out in Shanghai between laborers and the new
                            revolutionary rebels.</p>
                        <p>The new rebels are now added to the wandering, destructive Red Guards and
                            to the organized workers teams of the Liu-Teng party apparat. Yet
                            nothing seems to stay <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                            drive to complete his revolution. On 9 December <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>, who may yet become the
                            mediator but who now seems clearly identified with <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>, announced in a speech before thousands at the
                            Peking Workers' Stadium that after 20 December the Red Guards would be
                            given military training. In mid-January <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> reiterated his belief in the ultimate success of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s cultural
                            revolution.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0539"/>
                        <p>Whether <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> will succeed in fully
                            restoring his control will depend a great deal on whether or not he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> can reestablish
                            their control of the party apparatus. Gaining this control may rest in
                            part on seizing and using the information in the work team personnel
                            dossiers. On 8 September the Central Committee of the party and the
                            State Council published a regulation concerning the handling of state
                            and party secret documents generated during the cultural revolution. We
                            have not seen this regulation, but it was obviously not obeyed, for it
                            was supplemented by a directive on 5 October on the same subject issued
                            by the Central Committee and a similar directive on 6 October issued by
                            the Military Affairs Committee. By 16 November Party Central felt that a
                            supplementary directive was required. The full purpose of these
                            directives has simply been to force the party apparat to place the
                            cultural revolution documents and probably the party personnel records
                            in the hands of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We have pondered in earlier studies why <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin
                                Piao</persName> has not used the Army to force the party apparat to
                            bend to his will. Since the capture of the famous “work papers" in 1961
                            it has been clear that he does not fully control the command officer
                            corps, for many of these officers owe allegiance to senior marshals who
                            do not accept <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> as their
                            leader. It is now clear that Lin never even gained full control of the
                            political department of the army. Cleverly opposed by the organizational
                            elements of the party, probably through appointments made by Teng
                            Hsiao-P'ing, the Secretary General, and Yang Shang-K'um, the Chief of
                            the Party's Administrative Office, the army political department
                            remained under the direction of the party. <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> may have counted heavily on General Liu Chih-Chien,
                            long a mainstay of the political department and until three weeks ago
                            the principal army officer on <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s cultural revolution subcommittee of the Central
                            Committee, who turned against <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> in
                            late December and may now be under arrest. Liu's defection, like that of
                            T'Ao Chu, must have been a hard pill for <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> to accept, and cannot help but have set back the
                            time schedule of the GPCR. Liu must have participated in the
                            preparations for the third wave of the struggle against the party
                            apparat—that is, the training of the Peoples Army (<gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>) cadres to be <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s GPCR activists in establishing
                            the revolutionary rebel headquarters now appearing in China. Although it
                            is by no means clear, we believe this training has been conducted in
                            many of the military regions and districts for some weeks.</p>
                        <p>On 26 November the Shanghai Wen Hui Pao, so often <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s GPCR mouthpiece, described the
                            closing ceremonies at Tsinan of the 2nd Congress of activists of the
                            Tsinan armed forces. This “Congress" for the study of the works of Mao
                            was attended by 1,127 delegates. We speculate that from this group and
                            many such others being trained throughout <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0540"/>China, have come the hard core activists now seizing
                            the newspapers and labor unions in many cities.</p>
                        <p>China at mid-January appeared to be two circles of political power. One
                            circle is dominated by loyal subordinates of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> and the army, although there
                            is great confusion at every level. In the other circle the party apparat
                            reigns but barely rules. The strategy of the apparat is purely
                            defensive. Like the Chinese heroes of the three kingdoms, each official
                            is now thinking of alliance and of regional defense until the legitimate
                            rule of the Communist Party is reestablished under <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> or any other leader who will
                            reaffirm his predominance in his region. They have not reached the point
                            in political time where separate states are thought possible. This
                            spring, however, may bring a consideration of this possibility.</p>
                        <p>Historic parallels are never exact although this time events insist on
                            historic comparison. Some things have changed forever. The grim fact of
                            China's huge contemporary population guarantees little time for the fun
                            of political misadventure. Food prices are rising in Canton. We have no
                            way of estimating how badly the transport of food within China has
                            suffered under the vast movement of Red Guards, the forced transport
                            stoppages of the recalcitrant work teams or their battles with the
                            municipal Red Guards, and now through the onslaught of rebel
                            revolutionaries. The tie-ups, however, must have been and must be
                            massive. Today only one passenger train runs north from Canton City to
                            Wuhan and the north. Without transport China would not merely suffer the
                            ravages of 1961's malnutrition, but the hell of starvation. Moreover,
                            China at mid-month is bitterly cold. Hong Kong shivers in the worst cold
                            of a decade. Human dislocation, rising prices, short rations and cold
                            are Mao's new enemies. The party apparat knows this. Throughout China
                            local party units have been offering raises in wages and individual
                            incentives to inspire loyalty; indeed a labor bureaucracy may have
                            developed such incentives for years. Over and over they are accused by
                            the Mao-Lin adherents of tempting the masses with sugar coated
                            bullets.</p>
                        <p>It is, moreover, difficult to assess how long <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> can travel the same road. <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> must know that so many of the
                            vital managers of the party have been arrested, insulted and ridiculed,
                            that his power position is in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>Modern China may deprecate “face" as a feudal characteristic, but
                            self-confession has its limits and these have probably been reached.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s recent accusations
                            flick like a snake's tongue; no one is immune—the reorganized propaganda
                            department, the newspapers, his fellows on the cultural revolution
                            subcommittee, even his most old and trusted ministers. <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> will have an increasingly
                            difficult time organizing the cultural revolution while his mentor
                            purges follower after follower.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>In Chinese history the era of the three kingdoms is an interregnum, a
                            period of warring anarchy despised by the classical Chinese historian,
                            who prefers the established dynasty with its cultural grace. In our last
                            analysis we suggested that China's anarchical period would not last long
                            for historic reasons. We still believe this. Nevertheless it is
                            worthwhile to look back 1600 years to the time when China divided into
                            the three great states of Shu, Wu and <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName>, and when the art of political intrigue reached its
                            height. As short-lived as the modern divisions may be, they will be with
                            us in 1967 when a series of Chinese bravos will pass across the face of
                            the nation until one, shrewder than the rest, assumes command.</p>

                    <p>2162. 1. Following is Embassy assessment present <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> posture on military initiative against mainland:</p>
                    <p>2. Military: There continue to be no overt signs of preparation for any major
                        military action against the mainland, and no detectable increases in
                        planning, training, or accumulation of supplies or shipping. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has made no special requests for US
                        military assistance to take advantage of events on the mainland. We have
                        reliable reports that President Chiang has ordered that no actions be taken
                        to provoke ChiComs.</p>
                    <p>3. Authoritative public statements of government policy: <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> decided in October 1966 that traditional
                        “counterattack" theme would no longer be pushed because of low credibility
                        among overseas Chinese, those on the mainland, and elsewhere. Ambassador
                        Liu's <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech, and President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>'s Double Ten, New Years Day and Freedom Day
                        (January 23) messages all muted military aspect of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policy of “national recovery.”</p>
                    <p>4. The word filters down: <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has apparently
                        found it difficult to switch smoothly from time-honored “counterattack"
                        propaganda line to new approach which emphasizes cultural, moral and
                        historical aspects <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0542"/>of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> aspirations for fellow-countrymen on
                        mainland. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chou Shu-k'ai</persName>'s
                        recent embarrassment is good example of this. He attracted considerable
                        attention when on January 10 he reportedly said in Washington that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was preparing for “counterattack.” By
                        January 19, however, he was using instead President Chiang's New Years Day
                        thesis that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s return to mainland was
                        primarily a political, not military matter. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Ambassador to Manila apparently made similar shift in
                        public statements at about the same time. Our expressions of concern January
                        12 and 14 to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> (Taipei's 2083)<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">Telegram 2083 from Taipei, January 16, reported that
                            the Charge had delivered a message to Vice Foreign Minister
                                <persName>Shen</persName> as instructed in telegram 118633, January
                            13. (Both ibid.)</note> may have helped achieve these shifts.</p>
                    <p>5. Press and public opinion on Taiwan: <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        maintains the claim that it is sole legitimate government of all China.
                        Legal basis for national government apparatus, with mainlanders making all
                        important decisions, and for international status in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, rests on this claim. Given these present day realities as
                        well as historical background and past public utterances about
                        “counterattack" or “mainland recovery" it would be strange indeed if all
                        comments on these subjects suddenly ceased, and they have not. Traditional
                        “re-take the mainland" slogans still appear painted on walls in Taipei, and
                        are shouted in unison at military parades and anti-Communist rallies.
                        Polemicists in kmt and Legislative Yuan continue to urge prompt action
                        against mainland to take advantage of current disarray. However, until there
                        is some evidence in form of official approaches, statements, or military
                        preparations, these ritualistic warcries should not be construed as
                        presaging a GRC intention to launch an invasion of the mainland at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>6. Future <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> actions: If situation on
                        mainland changes markedly, calls for counterattack from certain old guard
                            <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> elements could become louder and
                        more frequent. Some officials could seek to persuade President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> that large scale military action is
                        feasible. In this event we anticipate that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would initiate official consultations as required under the
                        1954 Mutual Security Treaty and that US logistic assistance would be
                        requested. In the unlikely event that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        decided to take unilateral military action on any large scale we believe
                        that such preparations would be detected by us in advance. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could initiate small scale activity without
                        our prior knowledge.</p>
                    <p>7. Embassy and other US agencies will maintain close watch for signs of
                        unilateral military action.</p>

                                <persName>Wang</persName> charged U.S. trying “deceive" Chinese
                            people and “lull their fighting spirit" with proposals for contacts so
                            that it can “impose war on Chinese people at appropriate time.”</item>

                            maltreated, and that attempts made recruit them as spies or defectors to
                            Taiwan. Claimed Chinese had irrefutable evidence that U.S. had not
                            rescued but forced fishermen into Vietnamese ports against their

                            emphasized need to attempt create climate better understanding within
                            which larger problems might become easier to resolve. Emphasized
                            absurdity of allegation that U.S. intention in proposing private
                            cultural, journalistic contacts was to lull ChiCom into euphoria in
                            order attack them. Said our purpose precisely the opposite—to diminish
                            fear of attack and war by both sides. I reviewed at length U.S. position
                            on Viet-Nam peace negotiations and urged ChiComs if they feared U.S.
                            presence in Viet-Nam posed threat to them to join in move toward peace.
                            On fishermen, I quoted at length from fishermen's statements in Saigon's

                            extemporaneous excursion on “hundreds of years of U.S. oppression,
                            slaughter" of Chinese people, emphasizing inconsistency between U.S.
                            actions and words and insisting U.S. words could not be believed. As
                            meeting already in course three hours, I limited my response to
                            reiteration U.S. position on prisoners and expression of incredulity
                            that simple human-itarian gesture in helping fishermen in distress

                            prolonged discussion unavailing in moving him from what apparently firm
                            instructions hold to June date. <persName>Wang</persName> repeated
                            position he first advanced at last meeting that more frequent sessions

                            intervals. I finally agreed after emphasizing my belief more frequent
                            contacts desirable, and told him I would inform press we had suggested
                            earlier meeting but that this not agreeable to Chinese side. He

                                that he suspected the Soviet Union was making contingency plans “to

                                presumably involve an airborne task force, he concluded: “I trust
                                our intelligence services will keep an eye out for any indications
                                of preparations for such an operation.” (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>It can be safely stated that the Lop Nor test site and Shuang Cheng Tzu
                        missile test centers in China cannot be “played with" if overrun by Red
                        Guards. They are complexes sophisticated enough so that only the very few
                        qualified Chinese technical personnel can cope with them.</p>
                    <p>It can be further stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        no particular need to seize such facilities; they are of no use to the
                        Russians who are a dozen years ahead of the Chinese in systems and guidance.
                        Their only interest would be the same as ours in case of war, to utterly
                        destroy them for purposes of denial.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that Soviet planners are well aware of the potential unifying
                        factor in the Chinese picture should there be foreign intervention. After a
                        tradition of many decades of “foreign devils,” the Russians would be most
                        unlikely to intervene short of all-out war.</p>

                    <p>The intelligence community has a daily watch on the order of battle and
                        military buildup on the Sino-Soviet frontier. A recent study was completed
                        analyzing its growth over a 24-month period. The increase is gradual and
                        logical in the light of tensions and is not believed to indicate sudden
                        action at this time. These matters are under constant review by the United
                        States Intelligence Board.</p>
                    <p>It might be pointed out at this time that whereas the average reader perhaps
                        considers that the Russians are chortling with joy at the apparent chaos
                        overtaking China, serious Soviet thinkers, government officials, and

                                    is willing to play a more active role. There seemed to be about
                                    an even split of opinion as to the likelihood of this. In any
                                    event, there was agreement that such a solution would be
                                    short-range and that we will surely be dealing with a different
                                    China of some sort in the fairly near future.</item>

                                    and 2) the desire for nationhood is given an opportunity to
                                    assert itself because of the prospect of the country's falling
                                    apart.</item>

                                    likely of the four possibilities, but some felt that the Mao-Lin
                                    faction might still win the first round. Several believed that
                                    in this event, <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> would
                                    be kicked up rather than out, in order to borrow the umbrella of
                                    his prestige and charisma. Some thought that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s prestige may now be
                                    sinking to the point where, if the trend continues much longer,
                                    he could actually be a liability.</item>

                                    variant would be loss of peripheral regions under Soviet
                                    domination, but set up as “autonomous.”)</item>

                            was the most likely but also as to which would be most desirable from
                            the U.S. standpoint. There was agreement, however, that we probably
                            could not appreciably affect the outcome, and that attempts to do so
                            would be counterproductive at best and dangerously foolhardy at
                            worst.</item>

                        <item>The distinction was drawn between a “posture" and a “policy" toward
                            Communist China. Agreement was unanimous that our present “posture" of
                            quiet reasonableness and hope for ultimate reconciliation is about
                            right. Several participants questioned whether we had a full-fledged
                            “policy" toward Communist China at the present time, and some maintained
                            that we could not or should not have, insofar as “policy" implies a
                            series of actions. Several participants argued strongly that we should
                            take policy steps even now. It was conceded that any attempted steps
                            toward reconciliation now would be rebuffed and would not appre-ciably
                            affect China. The purpose would be to prepare for the future, to tidy up
                            present “anachronisms" and to gain in the eyes of third countries. It
                            was pointed out by others that in doing so we might well lose
                            substantially in the eyes of Asian friends, who, after all, are the ones
                            most concerned. It was strongly felt by some that even though it might
                            not seem to make sense to attempt conciliatory gestures when they would
                            not meet with response, the U.S. could only take these steps with grace
                            at a time when China is weak—i.e., when they would not be interpreted as
                            a knuckling under to pressure from a strong China.</item>

                                    In brief, he saw no prospect of a very meaningful reconciliation
                                    but believed that if a faction came to power in China which
                                    sought Soviet help, a limited price in such help might be paid
                                    for “the psychological asset of papering over differences
                                    between the two Communist giants.” He thought the Soviets were
                                    and would continue to be active in trying to bring about such a
                                    regime.</item>

                    <p>Comment: The conference went well and was mutually advantageous. Nothing
                        really new emerged but there was general agreement that thinking about some
                        issues had been usefully sharpened. I should say that the conference was a
                        distinct success from the standpoint of government-academic
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p>I found especially notable the relative lack of disagreement with our
                        policies in Vietnam and total lack of tendentiousness in discussing them.
                        This contrasts markedly with much of my experience of last summer's academic
                        swing—especially at Harvard.</p>
                    <p>In thinking back over the conference, I am left with one outstanding
                        disappointment. It seems to me that our academic friends are concentrating
                        in their policy probings on some possibly useful but peripheral measures. As
                        you know, before the present chaos on the mainland set in, I saw some
                        utility in trying to go a bit further than we had in “bridge-building.”
                        Considering the state of the mainland since, however, the real question
                        concerning these relatively minor and peripheral issues becomes one of
                        timing. As I restated recently I now believe that, having not taken some of
                        these steps in more normal times, we should postpone them until we can make
                        a much better judgment as to the course of events in China. (Recognition of
                        Mongolia is in a different category.) I do not believe that our Asian
                        friends, particularly, would understand our motivations and there is some
                        merit in saving our limited leverage for a time when some reason returns to
                        the mainland. Meanwhile it seems to me that an occasional high-level
                        reference to the desire for ultimate reconciliation is still in order.</p>
                    <p>We should marshall our planning resources not so much on matters of travel,
                        limited trade and a new <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> approach at this
                        time, but concentrate on the central issues: those having to do with China
                        in the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. We have, of course, been
                        making a tremendous—and I believe eminently correct—effort in filling the
                        power vacuum left by the demise of Japanese militarism, pre-empting it from
                        communist militarism. As a result, we are beginning to have an Asia of real
                        hope. If we are beginning to approach success in the knottiest of Asian
                        problems, the Sino-Vietnam one, we are entering a broad watershed period
                        which will require some changes for its other side. Very little was said in
                        the conference about how China of whatever future complexion relates to the
                        future role of Japan, the future status of Taiwan, the sort of Southeast
                        Asia we want to see post-Vietnam and how much it will require, what sort of
                        presence from us, the possible future pull on China from successful Asian
                        regional ventures, the desirability and degree of Soviet presence and
                        investment in some of these ventures, the composition of probable future
                        regional military coalescences (probably first involving parts of Southeast
                        Asia and Southwest Pacific), the likelihood and desirability of Japanese
                        participation and the need for U.S. balancing <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0551"/>of Japan in that event, the effects if Japan and/or India
                        go nuclear, etc. Some of these were mentioned, but hardly more than en
                        passant. I hope that in the next meeting we can gain the benefit of more
                        discussion in these areas from this impressive group of outsiders.</p>

                    <p>Events of the last couple of days have the smell of something rather big
                        having happened in Peking. Unquestionably an effort is being made to curb
                        the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, at least for the present: <list>
                            <item>—Red Guards have again been urged to return home and this time
                                appear to be complying;</item>
                            <item>—primary and secondary education are to be resumed;</item>
                            <item>—widespread humiliation of errant leaders and cadre is to cease
                                and reliable elements in the party apparatus are to be won over
                                rather than attacked;</item>
                            <item>—the military, having for the most part not responded to the plea
                                to support revolutionary rebel take-over, is now moving in on the
                                side of simply maintaining public order;</item>
                            <item>—spring planting in the countryside is to be emphasized at the
                                expense of political activity;</item>
                            <item>—the xenophobic spree has been turned off like a faucet, at least
                                for the present.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>These developments follow a brief period wherein the Army was tested with far
                        less than satisfactory results from the Maoist viewpoint. I believe this to
                        have been only the last in a series of surprises for <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> concerning <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0552"/>the magnitude of his opposition, as he has successively
                        turned during the Cultural Revolution to the several major elements in the
                        society. He has increasingly suffered from a classical phenomenon of a
                        regime of this sort: the difficulty of receiving accurate reports, either
                        from the home or the foreign front, which would often be unflattering to one
                        who has been deified.</p>
                    <p>If because of the test results of the Cultural Revolution <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is now forced to face reality and curb
                        that Revolution far short of its goals, his prestige will again have
                        suffered severely. Having built revolutionary fires, he may even find it
                        difficult to lower the temperature of the Revolution to the desired degree.
                        Animosity has obviously been greatly heightened among the split leadership
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s methods in conducting the
                        Revolution have contributed to sharpening the large opposition which he has
                        progressively uncovered in each phase of the Revolution.</p>
                    <p>As <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>'s activity and perhaps
                        even prestige has sunk, <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou
                        En-Lai</persName>'s has risen. However, while Lin is less obviously heir
                        apparent, <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> is not yet in that
                        role. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> may be smart enough not
                        to aspire to being heir apparent, when it is not now apparent what he would
                        be inheriting! He is emerging stronger, but I still look upon him as a first
                        class “<gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>” to a “political appointee"—which
                        may yet turn out to be a military self-appointee.</p>
                    <p>What can be said is that the forces of moderation (in domestic policy) are on
                        the march and are not likely to be stopped. If those forces should coalesce
                        and become articulate, I believe the peasants, the most important element
                        not yet appreciably tested, may support them. For never have so many worked
                        so hard for so little—after having been promised so much for so long.</p>

                            Jorden commented that given the current situation in China, almost
                            anything said in favor of pragmatism or reason would be interpreted by
                            some as taking a stand in the internal conflict. He concluded: “I don't

                            was not conversant with the problem. I refrained from replying that that

                        <item>He said flatly and directly that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            was not supplying arms or funds to irregular units in Thailand. He said
                            Thai Govt had repeatedly requested that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> exercise better control over the units to prevent loss
                            of civil control in northern Thailand. He said neither Tuan Hsi-wen nor
                            Li Wen-huan was amenable to much control, and that they had until
                            recently refused to come to Taiwan for discussions. Tuan had finally
                            visited Taiwan a few months ago, but conversations had not been
                            satisfactory. Gen Hsu Ju-ch'i had just been sent to the area by the GRC
                            to look into present conditions, and when Hsu returned DefMin would be
                            in touch with Embassy again. <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>
                            said he thought USG had not understood the situation correctly, possibly
                            because of statement Tuan Hsi-wen might have made on return to Thailand,
                            in order to bolster his prestige asserting that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would send assistance.</item>

                            no intention of augmenting or supplying the units. He said that he was
                            referring, as I had earlier, only to the organized units, and not to
                            certain intelligence collection efforts in the border area, which would
                            of course continue.</item>

                            arrange an air shipment through Laos, but that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had refused.</item>

                        <item>Comment: Lack of candor on this subject is par for the course and was
                            to be expected. However believe we have made some headway on this
                            problem in that: (a) <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> has
                            assured us that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is not going to
                            augment or supply the units (and even if this turns out to be untrue we
                            have additional leverage because of the assertion); (b) He has promised
                            to be in touch with us again when Gen Hsu returns and we may be able to
                            glean more information and obtain more assurances at that time; (c) He
                            has denied any intention to establish an air supply route through Laos,
                            (although at same time apparently misrepresenting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s reported recent use of the

                    <p>The situation in China is so confused as to defy brief description. The
                        accompanying map<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">Not attached to the source
                            text.</note> is the best that can be done by way of indicating the
                        province-by-province situation as of today, but it does not reflect the
                        magnitude of the confusion. It shows that most of China is still in dispute,
                        but the significant fact is that not a single province or municipality shown
                        as in either the pro- or anti-Mao camp is without elements of significant
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>I strongly suspect that the Soviets have been instigating and aiding anti-Mao
                        resistance in Sinkiang, Manchuria and possibly Inner Mongolia.</p>
                    <p>Ever since <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s call to “seize
                        power" throughout the country, there have been numerous phony power
                        seizures, so that it has been difficult <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0556"/>for anyone to tell who are the “genuine revolutionaries"
                        and who the “enemy.” Even local military units have difficulty in
                        identifying which of competing rival groups actually have Mao's sanction,
                        and which authority in the confused military chain of command to respond
                        to.</p>
                    <p>Much of this confusion arises from the fact that the revolution itself was
                        artificial in its inception, inasmuch as Mao imposed it from the top. Its
                        stated objectives have been too generalized and too vacillating to afford
                        practical guidance for consistent action, even if major elements of the
                        society desired to further its objectives.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s opposition has eagerly added
                        to the confusion by promoting dissention, by offering economic incentives to
                        workers and peasants, by walking off the job, and at times by feigning
                        support. Peking complains that many groups have “used the name of
                        revolutionary rebel organizations falsely.” Furthermore, there is continued
                        resistance to the few “revolutionary" organizations which have received
                        Peking's blessing as genuine. It is possible that their control does not
                        extend much beyond provincial capitals.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> still retains the initiative,
                        and the opposition is not broadly organized except perhaps in Tibet,
                        Szechuan and Inner Mongolia. The atmosphere of suspicion, mistrust,
                        and—perhaps most of all—uncertainty, now pervades the entire unhappy
                        country. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has unleashed forces
                        which are not yet ready to listen to exhortations for moderation. The
                        Minister of Security has called on genuine revolutionaries to “put an end to
                        armed struggle" and to “stop using loudspeakers to insult their enemies.”
                        However, typical provincial radio comment continues to say to all “demons
                        and monsters" that the revolutionary rebels will “resolutely suppress you
                        and smash your dogs' heads.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s grand design in foreign policy
                        of two years ago has failed completely, and it now appears that his domestic
                        economy may well be disrupted by the Cultural Revolution as seriously as it
                        was by the Great Leap of 1958–59.</p>

                    <p>Strenuous attempts in the past ten days to reverse the alarming trend toward
                        anarchy in China can only be interpreted as an ignominious failure of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s Cultural Revolution—at
                        least temporarily, and almost certainly for the long run as well. However,
                        this tactical backtracking, if it can be accomplished, may save the nation
                        from literally breaking apart.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> appears consistently, at each
                        stage of his grand design to restore purity and elan to the revolution, to
                        have underestimated the strength of his opposition. The final blow was the
                        relative unresponsiveness of the armed forces when they were called upon
                        some three weeks ago to support the seizure of power by “revolutionary
                        rebels.” (No significant Maoist successes have been reported for over two
                        weeks.) For the most part the Army has stepped in merely in attempts to
                        restore order, and not to further the fortunes of the Maoist
                        revolutionaries.</p>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, there has been a steady decline in the prestige of Defense
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>, identified with
                        the more extreme measures of the Cultural Revolution along with Madame
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and Cultural Revolution head
                        Chen Po-ta.</p>
                    <p>As usual, Premier <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>, a
                        moderate at least in domestic policies, has timed his moves with consummate
                        skill. In the past week he has appeared to be virtually in charge in Peking,
                        with important directives being issued in the names of Mao and Chou—even
                        those which ex officio <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>
                        would be expected to sign. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        recent confidence, and the reinstitution of moderate policies he has
                        advocated for the Cultural Revolution, almost certainly mean that he
                        believes he and his pragmatic policies now have strong, and perhaps
                        predominant, support in the armed forces.</p>
                    <p>Increasingly demonstrable damage to China's marginal economy, stemming from
                        the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, was doubtless foremost among other
                        factors enabling Chou and his supporters to bring about the present
                        attempted shift away from the Mao-Lin romantically <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0558"/>unrealistic program to remake Chinese
                        society. The inexorable demands of spring planting are a staunch support to
                        Chou in his efforts to restore reason.</p>
                    <p>No one can say whether he can be successful. The very respect for the central
                        government has been seriously damaged, and regional interests have become
                        both more insistent and more confident.</p>
                    <p>The tremendous amount of resentment engendered in all segments of society in
                        this turbulence may be long in abating. The chief disadvantaged group in
                        Chinese society is the emerging younger generation who have a secondary or
                        higher education. They were first flattered and drummed up to revolutionary
                        ferver, and now are told that they have acted immaturely and should go home
                        and keep quiet. They are not likely to do the latter.</p>
                    <p>Basically underlying the party dissention which exploded last year has been
                        the choice between technological growth and restoring revolutionary elan.
                        The Cultural Revolution may have insured that neither choice will be
                        available for a time: the likely prospect is for a period of political
                        weakness in which policies will be contradictory and indecisive.</p>

                        <item>Discussion: During the latter half of 1966, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> groped for a proper response to the
                            upset of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s Cultural
                            Revolution. Various intelligence and paramilitary schemes for possible
                            exploitation of the situation were drawn up, but they consisted in the
                            main of operations beyond <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            capabilities, or possible only with sizeable US support. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> apparently understands that such US
                            support will not be forthcoming.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intelligence units continue to
                            formulate plans for sabotage and other small-scale operations against
                            the mainland, but these units lack the capabilities to carry out these
                            plans to any significant extent. Results are unlikely to be any better
                            than in the past.</item>

                        <item>Since last fall there has been some shift of emphasis in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s approach to the problem of mainland
                            turmoil. President <persName>Chiang</persName> has ruled specifically
                            against any precipitate action at this time. This decision was made
                            explicit in the President's New Year's message, in which he called for
                            political rather than military action. Subsequently, we have received
                            reliable intelligence reports documenting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s disinclination to take military action at this
                            time.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>This wait-and-see stance is largely a product of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s limited capabilities for unilateral
                            action, but it is reinforced now by real conviction that outside
                            pressures might retard rather than accelerate disintegrative trends on
                            the mainland. This position may shift if a real break-down of Communist
                            authority on the mainland occurs, or if the GRC concludes that it has
                            occurred. Even then, however, we would expect the response of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to be conditioned by the amount of US
                            support it thought it could muster.</item>

                                great problem is that the state of the nation is such that even his
                                policies will require Army insurance for their implementation. This
                                is dangerous. He may not succeed.</item>

                    <p>There are those who believe that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        is still fully in charge, and that he now purposefully desires to halt at
                        the present “Half-way House" with <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> as its major domo. I doubt the validity of both
                        assumptions. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has simply been
                        unable to carry out his announced policies, and reports of ill health are
                        increasingly convincing. The recent Albanian report of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s partial incapacitation is more
                        credible than the Mauritanian one that he is in good health. The
                        Mauritanians, who had never seen <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        previously, could have met a double. This would not have been possible with
                        the Albanians. Furthermore, the Albanians have no reason to invent
                        ill-health for <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>—quite the
                        contrary. True, Maoism, under whatever—doubtless complex—auspices, ran the
                        Cultural Revolution as long as it ran, but it has about run down. Some
                        elements will surely continue to push for reforms in line with Mao's
                        doctrinal purity, but their cause has received an impressive rebuff and we
                        may have seen the last determined effort.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the sudden ascendancy of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin
                            Piao</persName>, the only three contenders other than <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> for <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s mantle were Liu Shao-Ch'i, Teng Hsiao-P'ing and P'eng
                        Chen. The latter three seem to be no longer in the running, and Liu's status
                        is at least problematical. Furthermore, the policies which <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> has long advocated now appear to have
                        military backing. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> may be able to
                        weather this embarrassment, but <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName>
                        may not.</p>
                    <p>So long as <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s extreme policies
                        were in command, the Army did not assist in the purging of provincial
                        leaders. (The Army's role in the Peking purges is not clear.) Reports from
                        the recent trouble spots of Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang, Szechwan and Kwangtung
                        now suggest compromises, with strong hints that some of the top leadership
                        have been replaced, with Army acquiescence or connivance. Those involved are
                        mostly Liu and Teng men, whose political demise both <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> would probably applaud. It will be interesting to see
                        whether <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> men take their places.
                        The top men in running the economy now appear to be Li Hsien-nien and T'ao
                        Chen-lin, both of whom are long-time associates of Chou. Certainly they have
                        not secured or retained influence because of adherence to a particular
                        policy line, for Li is far to the right within the lop-sided Chinese
                        Communist spectrum, while T'ao was one of the most <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0563"/>zealous of the Great Leapers. Chou himself
                        appears lately to have a strong hand in running the military
                        establishment.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">C. Policy Implications</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is too early to decide that <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>
                        is comfortably in the saddle and likely to remain there. The power struggle
                        could continue for some time. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that Chou wants
                        the top job. However, at the moment he is more in the saddle than anyone
                        else and there is no one yet visible who is likely to challenge him
                        successfully. Even if Chou does not want the top job he may have to rule, in
                        fact if not in name, during a “holding in trust" period.</p>
                    <p>It is not too early to try to divine what sort of China we might have if
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> is to dominate the scene.
                        This is a murky area in which to prophesy, for Chou has been an executor
                        rather than an initiator, but it is worth the effort. The transition to some
                        new course, which is now bound to come under whatever leadership, is likely
                        to take quite a few more months. The outlines of the new course may be
                        apparent by about May, however, and it is conceivable that we may be faced
                        with some hard decisions by summer.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that if Chou is running things we may expect something like
                        the following: <list>

                                    appeared likely?</p>

                                    China?</p>
                                <p>Since the post-Maoist regime (with or without <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> as “Chairman Emeritus”) is
                                    likely, at least for a time, to continue to be anti-American and
                                    to rebuff advances from us, should we fight its acceptance by
                                    others? Should we read this putative regime's near-universal
                                    acceptance as being inevitable and make a try for the supposed
                                    advantages of early overtures, in the hope of a new day in
                                    Sino-American relations? Even if ultimate near-universal
                                    acceptance appears inevitable, is there merit in our delaying
                                    overtures until we appear to be swept along (because of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> or other considerations)? Has
                                    the combination of China's “madness" and its growing power
                                    reached the point where we should seize upon the first good
                                    excuse to get China better articulated with international
                                    problems?</p>
                                <p>To what extent should we discuss these vital questions with
                                    certain allies before the time of decision? This applies
                                    especially, perhaps, to our Asian allies, and among them most
                                    particularly Japan. Since in the quest for a stable Asia the
                                    overriding desideratum is a reasonably promising balance of
                                    power, where does the Soviet Union, as a Pacific power, fit into
                                    the scheme?</p>
                                <p>These are some of the questions to which, it seems to me, the

                            conversation was transmitted with airgram A–595, March 4. (Both ibid.,
                            and in Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/<persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">GOLDBERG</persName>)</note> expressed fears similar to those of Sato,
                        namely: that the Soviets would choose to take advantage of the disorder on
                        the mainland to fulfill long harbored expansionist designs. In this very
                        limited sense, he seemed to have something in common with the mainland
                        regime.</p>
                    <p>At the same time he has clearly not renounced hopes of overthrowing that
                        regime. Indeed, the major portion of his discussion with me consisted of the
                        following analysis and request, which he asked specifically be conveyed to
                        you. Given the serious split between Moscow and Peking, the drain of Vietnam
                        on Peking's resources, and the serious turmoil on the mainland itself, now
                        is the golden opportunity to rid the mainland of the Communist regime and
                        destroy the Chinese nuclear threat. Unless this is done, the war in Vietnam
                        cannot be ended and will in fact be extended to a wider area. The people on
                        the mainland, while not able to overthrow the Communist regime from within,
                        have now become anti-Mao (in addition to being anti-Communist) and would
                        rally to his cause if he were to return to the mainland with force. All that
                        is needed to set this process in motion is the approval and logistic
                        support—but not manpower—of the US.</p>
                    <p>I, of course, undertook to convey this analysis and request to you and
                        avoided any substantive reply. Nevertheless, feeling it advisable to <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0566"/>prepare the way for a rejection of
                        the Generalissimo's request, I did note that US commitments elsewhere were
                        onerous, that the American people were in no mood to increase their
                        involvement in potentially dangerous situations, and that the general
                        American mood was one wanting to reduce rather than create new tension in
                        Asia. I need scarcely add that my own conviction is that the Generalissimo's
                        request should be politely but categorically rejected.</p>
                    <p>As requested by the Secretary of State, I raised the question of our
                        recognition of Outer Mongolia leaving further discussion to our
                        Ambassador.</p>

                    <p>5546. 1. During wide-ranging critique of U.S. policy which it was my function
                        to present at recent Baguio meeting, I made certain suggestions on medium
                        and long range policies for Taiwan and the Pescadores. These suggestions
                        were tabled “for further staffing.”</p>
                    <p>2. In order provide framework for those who wish examine these suggestions
                        further, I will spell out in this message the rather sketchy oral statement
                        which I made at Baguio. As I said in that presentation, it is a proposal
                        which I believe ought to be examined in further detail.</p>
                    <p>3. Moreover, it is based on two premises. The first is the assumption that
                        Communist China's internal problems will keep it occupied for a long time
                        and that our function is to prepare the framework into which we would like
                        to see China fitted when and if it decides to rejoin polite society. The
                        second assumption is that we will achieve a successful and satisfactory
                        stabilization of the military problem in Southeast Asia which will permit us
                        to withdraw a large portion of our armed forces from Vietnam, but which will
                        leave us the necessity of remaining alert for possible ready reintroduction.
                        Flowing from these two premises, would be the probability that we could thin
                        out our U.S. troop commitments in both Korea and Vietnam to more or less
                        “trip-wire" proportions.</p>
                    <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0567"/>
                    <p>4. From this base, I predicated the idea that our interests and those of
                        Japan lay in seeing Taiwan and the Pescadores permanently divorced from
                        Mainland China, even a Mainland China which converted to a considerable
                        benevolence. In short, both we and the Japanese have a vested interest in a
                        “Two China" situation.</p>
                    <p>5. My proposal, therefore, was that we move, with appropriate associates, to
                        define the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as limited
                        to Taiwan and the Pescadores, in accordance with the administrative sphere
                        assigned the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> by the Supreme Commander
                        for the Allied Powers, under whose authority the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ultimately occupies and administers these islands. There is
                        a sound legal case for this, well preserved in our diplomatic acts and in
                        treaties affecting this territory.</p>
                    <p>6. This, in turn, would lead to a definition of territorial representatives
                        in the United Nations and establish a “Two China" situation there, providing
                        the framework into which an ultimate, reformed, Mainland China might one day
                        be fitted.</p>
                    <p>7. It would also require the GRC abandonment of the Offshore Islands and a
                        clear stipulation by the U.S. Government (as distinct from our current
                        deliberate vagueness) that the so-called “Formosa Resolution" applies to
                        Taiwan and the Pescadores only.</p>
                    <p>8. In order to give some enforcement to these measures, I further recommended
                        the deployment of a forward ready reserve of U.S. ground forces to Taiwan.
                        This would doubtless have to be accomplished before we went to the mat with
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on such matters as the Offshore
                        Islands and the Formosa resolution. The troops would be some of those
                        withdrawn from Korea and Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>9. In part, this deployment would have a military and psychological purpose,
                        to give positive evidence, in the area, of our readiness to renew our
                        presence in either Vietnam or Korea should conditions warrant. In larger
                        part, it would have a political purpose, directly associated with China
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>10. Its first political purpose would be to prevent a deal behind our backs
                        and against our interest. To borrow <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Ed
                            Rice</persName>'s phrase “When the empire unites, it tends to divide;
                        when the empire divides, it tends to unite”. A deliberate “Two China" policy
                        would please the Taiwanese and perhaps many of the second generation
                        Mainlanders: but there would be many of the old Mainlanders who would rather
                        make a deal with Peking than be subjected to permanent divorce from the
                        Mainland. Our troop presence would be designed to inhibit this.</p>
                    <p>11. Moreover, our troop presence would be designed as a blue chip for
                        eventual negotiations with Peking. As matters now stand, even a regenerate
                        Mainland regime could be expected to demand the return of Taiwan before
                        agreeing to any sort of normal relations with the U.S. In the event, there
                        would be a great popular pressure, at home and abroad, <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0568"/>to make this sacrifice, especially if
                        Peking appeared less and less bloody minded. In the current circumstances,
                        the only things we could bargain against Peking's demand would be the
                        Offshore Islands. Now, these the ChiComs could take in any event unless we
                        were willing to fight for them (highly dubious prospect).</p>
                    <p>12. Hence, if, when faced with Peking's demand, we have a lot of U.S. troops
                        whose presence we can trade away against an international agreement
                        guaranteeing the independence of Taiwan and the Pescadores, we are in a far
                        better bargaining position. As Admiral Sharp points out, Guam is good a
                        place as any for our ready reserve, and we would really not deprive
                        ourselves of much military advantage if we withdrew there, especially if we
                        could do this in return for an agreed independence for Taipei.</p>
                    <p>13. Finally, it can be argued that U.S. troops in Taiwan would obviate the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> requirement for a large, costly
                        standing army. If this argument is accepted, we would have less MAP costs,
                        less effective opposition to “Two Chinas" and more resources, both financial
                        and human, for Taiwan's economic development.</p>
                    <p>14. These, then, are the elements for a staff study. I hope it can be
                        presented in final form for debate at next year's Baguio Conference.</p>

                        <item>Central to this new plan is a proposal for the future stationing of
                            U.S. troops on Taiwan, ostensibly for the primary purpose of serving as
                            ready reserve for reintroduction if necessary into Southeast Asia but
                            actually to inhibit a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-Mainland deal
                            behind our backs, eventually to force the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to evacuate the Offshore Islands, and ultimately to
                            trade withdrawal of our troops for ChiCom acceptance of an international

                        <item>For reasons set forth in subsequent paragraphs I think this plan
                            infeasible. Against background of estimates of present military balance
                            in Offshore Islands-Taiwan Straits area, however, it does suggest means
                            whereby U.S. forces could perhaps be used to achieve one of Ambassador
                            Sullivan's objectives—bringing about evacuation of Offshores and
                            consequent de facto separation of Taiwan from Mainland. If the increased
                            ChiCom inventories of supersonic all-weather aircraft and of naval units
                            means <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could not successfully handle
                            another Taiwan Straits crisis without U.S. help, then we have improved
                            chance of successfully pressing for evacuation of Offshores. This result
                            might be obtained prior to emergence such crisis when and if President
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> becomes convinced military return to
                            Mainland not possible or after he is succeeded by more realistic
                            leadership. It might be obtained in event of such crisis by making our
                            lending necessary military assistance conditional on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> agreement to evacuation of the
                            Offshores. (A case, and perhaps a better one, could be made for further
                            modernization <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> defense establishment
                            to give it qualitative air and naval superiority so that we would not

                        <item>Main defect of Sullivan plan is its deviousness, which is open to
                            objection on purely pragmatic grounds that we would not be able
                            convincingly to mask our purposes and thereby accomplish them. The
                            Chinese are past masters and we mere children when it comes to
                            dissembling innocence and carrying on devious games. I do not believe we
                            could propose bringing to Taiwan the forces Ambassador Sullivan has in
                            mind, for the ends he contemplates, without the ever-suspicious Chinese
                            seeing through our purposes. If their agreement were forthcoming it
                            would be because of Chinese confidence that our designs could be
                            thwarted, and the presence of our troops used instead to serve <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests.</item>

                        <item>Most of us who have worked full-time on Chinese affairs would disagree
                            with assumption contained paragraph 11 reftel that evacuation Offshores
                            is something we now could use in bargaining with Peking. <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0570"/>(The presence on the Offshores of

                            it may some day give Peking the chance to deal the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> a devastating blow; meanwhile they like
                            it because it helps prevent a so-called Two-Chinas solution.) It also is
                            far from sure that ChiComs would bargain for the evacuation of U.S.
                            forces from Taiwan. Instead they might bank on stirring up Chinese
                            xenophobia on Taiwan against the U.S. occupation of the island and U.S.
                            efforts to control its government. Finding that the ChiComs would not
                            bargain for the evacuation of bases we had built up to accommodate our
                            forces—doubtless at considerable expense—we would be tempted to retain
                            the bases and keep our forces on Taiwan.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In that event we would find ourselves more deeply and perhaps
                            inextricably involved with the two Chinese sides. As I pointed out in
                            Baguio, our experience with past involvements in China has been anything
                            but happy or profitable, and pursuing them is likely to prove no more
                            fortunate and to leave us deeper in the red. If the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ever gives us an honorable means of
                            ending the involvement, we should not lightly pass it up.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>At a time well before we had a treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and when we were considering what attitude we should
                            adopt toward a possible ChiCom invasion of Taiwan, I felt that Mainland
                            control of Taiwan was contrary to U.S. interests, and said so. I still
                            feel that way today and believe we must stand by our obligations under
                            the defense treaty we subsequently negotiated. However I am not
                            convinced that the real estate the treaty is designed to protect is
                            worth the ultimate risks for us which the treaty—which represented
                            intervention in an unfinished civil war—may entail. Hence, if the GRC
                            wishes to nullify the treaty by making a deal with the Mainland, we
                            would be relieved of our moral obligation to it and should not, I think,
                            go so far as to use force or the threat of force against the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in order to hold it to that
                            treaty.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I doubt any regime likely to emerge on the Chinese Mainland in the
                            near future is going to become party to an international agreement
                            whereby it formally accedes to the permanent separation of Taiwan from
                            the Mainland. There is a better chance it will learn to live with such a
                            separation. It seems to me that a situation in which it did so would
                            represent the optimum practicable goal of relevant U.S. policy for the
                            foreseeable future.</item>

                    <p>2798. 1. <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> called on me at my
                        residence at his own request March 14 principally to suggest regular
                        exchanges of views on China Mainland, and policies and actions directed
                        thereto. He thought meetings should be held at least once a month.</p>
                    <p>2. He began by giving categorical assurance that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> major policies are “fully coordinated" with those of the
                        US, that they have been in the past and will continue to be so in future. He
                        said that as Gimo had told Amb <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, it is important that we achieve close coordination
                        of views and actions, and asked for my assessment of present Mainland
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>3. I thanked him for assurance of close coordination and welcomed regular
                        exchange of views. I outlined for him the US view that Mainland tensions
                        were being damped down, probably for tactical and pragmatic reasons, and as
                        at least a temporary measure to prevent economic chaos. I covered, inter
                        alia, role <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> seemed to be
                        playing, our puzzlement at the virtual disappearance of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> and Liu from the stage, our feeling
                        that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s views were unlikely to
                        have undergone fundamental change, and the probability that both the power
                        struggle and the ideological controversy are far from over. I said I would
                        like to obtain latest assessments from Washington and Hong Kong and to
                        continue the discussion next week.</p>
                    <p>4. CCK said he agreed with my analysis, that the Mainland situation is
                        “highly abnormal" and that we will all need more time to observe events
                        before we can come to firm conclusions. In response to my question, CCK said
                        the ChiComs would not change their views on the Vietnam war, and would do
                        their best to block any peace settlement. A settlement would not only be a
                        sharp reverse for ChiCom foreign policy, but would have serious internal
                        consequences as well. He said he thought the ChiComs could get through the
                        spring planting season without too much trouble, but that there would be a
                        critical period at the time of the fall harvest.</p>
                    <p>5. I asked for any indications of ChiCom intentions in the Taiwan Straits,
                        referring to the recent incidents of ChiCom boat incursions near the
                        Offshore Islands. He said that aside from these incidents there were no
                        particular indications. Some ChiCom troops in the Fukien area had <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0572"/>been rotated, but overall numbers
                        remained the same. Psywar activities, however, had been stepped up,
                        especially those aimed at Taiwanese soldiers, with Fukienese dialect
                        replacing Mandarin as the language used in broadcasts and over loudspeakers.
                        There had been a doubling of the number of balloon-bearing propaganda
                        leaflets (to 380 in the past month) over the similar period last year, when
                        prevailing winds permit such ChiCom operations. He was somewhat concerned
                        that rumors are being spread on Taiwan that the leaflets are released here
                        by a strong Communist underground, and to counter this, the GRC is making
                        known that they are carried to Taiwan by balloon. The leaflets and other
                        materials, which include books on <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s thought and on the Cultural Revolution, are more
                        specifically targeted toward <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed
                        forces, although they use familiar themes that the US is disengaging from
                        and will eventually abandon the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, that
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops should assist in efforts to
                        liberate Taiwan, and exhorting troops to stage a coup and overthrow the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>6. CCK said he was getting questions from the Legislative Yuan on the level
                        of US military assistance, and mentioned a newspaper report that a sum of
                        US$200 million had been earmarked for division between Korea and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. I said this could not be true, since
                        Congress had not acted on the appropriation request, and since in any case
                        they do not earmark MAP funds by country in this manner. I assured him that
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s needs were put forward vigorously,
                        but I cautioned him that Vietnam needs had priority, and that there seemed
                        to be strong Congressional sentiment for economy elsewhere. I said that some
                        other countries (including Korea, Thailand and the Philippines) had special
                        requirements, and that it could be impossible to divide up a reduced
                        appropriation among the recipients to the satisfaction of all.</p>
                    <p>7. CCK said he was sure I understood the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        need. He said the ChiComs watch carefully all news of US military
                        assistance, and there is a political impact caused by any change in level. I
                        said I would try to get additional information from Washington on current
                        prospects for MAP, although there could be no positive estimate at this
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>8. CCK invited me to go with him on a brief visit to Matsu Island early next
                        month, travelling by sea, without any publicity for the trip. I said I would
                        of course like to go, but I would need to seek Washington authorization, and
                        they might feel that Matsu was a somewhat more exposed position than
                        Quemoy.</p>
                    <p>9. Comment: Believe we have enough information in Embassy derived from Hong
                        Kong reports and Baguio discussions so that I can continue substantive
                        discussions of Mainland situation next week. However would appreciate any
                        new information or assessments that are available.</p>
                    <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0573"/>
                    <p>10. Re paras 6 and 7 above on MAP levels, realize there is little that can be
                        said now, except to continue give warning of possible reductions. However
                        would appreciate any additional guidance available.</p>
                    <p>11. Re Matsu trip (para 8), I will make recommendation at later time.
                        Response to invitation can be deferred.</p>

                        <item>The President wishes to say that he has given the most serious thought
                            to what President <persName>Chiang</persName> has said. On this subject
                            the U.S. Government's views are known to President
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, and there has been no change in our
                            position. The U.S. has long sought to bring about peace in the Taiwan
                            Strait and to this end has for many years urged the Chinese Communists
                            to renounce the use of force there. The U.S. agrees with the Republic of
                            China's position that its mission of restoring freedom to the population
                            on the Mainland is to be achieved mainly by political means, not
                            military force, and was pleased to see this theme stressed in President
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s New Year's message to the Chinese

                        <item>On October 4 we advanced for your approval a memorandum recommending
                            certain changes in our trade and transaction controls against Communist
                            China. Briefly, these recommendations concerned changes in Foreign
                            Assets Control and other regulations to provide for the rescission of
                            special bunkering controls, to establish a general license for travel
                            and related expenses of Americans travelling legally to Communist China,
                            and to place under general license all tourist purchases of Chinese-type
                            goods valued at $100.00 or less. These changes were directed not at
                            China itself but at removing points of irritation in the enforcement of
                            our regulations with third countries and with United States citizens.
                            However, the changes were envisaged as a first step in a relaxation of
                            our embargo on trade with China in the light of our exploration of
                            possible ways to pierce mainland China's isolation. (Memorandum attached

                            things so far as China is concerned: (a) allow U.S. subsidiaries abroad,
                            with certain exceptions, to engage in non-strategic trade with China,
                            and (b) make <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> regulations
                            inapplicable to U.S. dollar transactions between China and third
                            parties. These proposed changes are designed to strengthen our relations
                            with third countries by eliminating points of friction over
                            extraterritorial application of <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>
                            regulations. They will have practically no influence on our trade policy

                            medical supplies usable in combatting epidemics be placed under general

                                    concern of the Peking regime regarding the belated organization

                            paving the way for limited trade now was the most promising way for
                            giving credibility to the U.S. stance of hoping for long term

                            Revolution was raging, no major policy initiatives towards China were
                            advisable. At the same time both groups believed that the Cultural
                            Revolution offered us the opportunity for further action in removing
                            barriers on our side to eventual reconciliation. Relaxation of trade
                            controls was specifically cited by both groups as falling within this
                            latter category. The possibility of food shortages later this year adds
                            urgency.</item>

                        <item>Changes in our regulations would not, we believe, lend material
                            support through China to North Viet-Nam's war effort. Permitted exports
                            include no “strategic” goods. China supplies rice to North Viet-Nam, but
                            if cereals are sold to Communist China we do not envisage shipments of
                            rice; 1967–68 world demand for U.S. rice already exceeds our capacity to
                            meet it; and Peking's 1966–67 grain imports from Western sources are
                            entirely wheat.</item>

                            States, and (2) would eliminate a long-standing complaint against the

                            about his recent visit to Communist China and said he would be willing

                        <p>The visit lasted 18 days. The highlight was a 2–1/2 hour discussion with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> on March 28.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> and other leaders
                            constantly spoke of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> collusion
                            and spoke more about <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than U.S.
                            They traced collusion back to Khrushchev's 1958 refusal to reaffirm that
                            an attack on China would be considered an attack on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> thought U.S. would move to
                            attack China when we were sure it would not affect the stability of the
                            Soviet Government. U.S. action against China would involve Chinese
                            reaction against all bases of attack, specifically mentioning Japan,
                            Philippines, Laos, and Thailand.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> said he was considering the
                            termination of Warsaw talks because they were being exploited by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Malley thought the Chinese wanted to enter the Vietnamese War. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> had reiterated China prepared to
                            send volunteers to North Vietnam a day after North Vietnam requests

                        <p>North Vietnam representative in Peking confirmed the offer and said North
                            Vietnam (a) Did not want Chinese and (b) Would have to accept Eastern
                            Europe volunteers if they took the Chinese with consequent political
                            problems for themselves.</p>
                        <p>North Vietnam representative said, however, Chinese and North Vietnamese
                            were then discussing, on contingency basis, terms and conditions under
                            which volunteers would be accepted if a decision was made.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> said North Vietnam's
                            proposal to talk to U.S. if we stopped bombing had been cleared with him
                            by Pham Van Dong. Said he had warned him U.S. would then stiffen its
                            position, and that Hanoi would be stuck with its offer. Said he had been
                            right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> identified Liu Shao Chi
                            with Soviets from time of his assumption of office. Said Central
                            Committee had voted against Liu on March 26, but Malley had the
                            impression that legal quorum was not present.</p>

                        <p>Malley concluded that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> Forces
                            would clearly win and said <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>
                            is confident of this also. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>
                            said the Government fully controlled 8 provinces. Army Chief of Staff
                            admitted there had been revisionists in the army but denied any
                            split.</p>
                        <p>In chance meeting with North Vietnamese Colonel Van Lau, who had gone to
                            Burma to talk to <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant, Van Lau heaped
                            abuse on <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant and said he had rejected
                                <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant's ceasefire idea in Burma. He
                            expected U.S. to exploit Thant's proposal.</p>
                        <p>Van Lau said North Vietnam expected U.S. invasion for purposes of seizing
                            and holding enclaves (which it could probably do) and for purpose of
                            holding them to trade against withdrawal of North Vietnam's presence in
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Van Lau said North Vietnam had released an exchange between President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> and Ho Chi Minh because U.S. constantly
                            was implying it in meaningful contact with Hanoi and they wished to make
                            clear no meaningful discussion is going on.</p>
                        <p>Malley concluded <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> was deified
                            in China to the extent that groups rallying around his name are certain
                            to be successful. But thought he was far removed from day-to-day conduct
                            of government. He also felt adulation attached to him could not be
                            transferred to others and that if he died succession would be difficult
                            question. He thought <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>
                            had no power base and could be easily removed at will by those now
                            holding the power.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> told Malley, in context
                            Soviet untrustworthiness, that he had received a message from the

                            Game</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The costly game of power measurement continues in China with no clearly
                        discernible and significant shift in power realities so far as pro-and
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> elements are concerned.
                        Recently exacerbated differences within the Maoist camp, however, may
                        presage a further drop in <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                        fortunes. The most noteworthy fact in the top leadership struggle is that
                        not a single person of prominence in the opposition has defected to the
                        Maoists. The opposition is serving by standing remarkably firm and waiting
                        long.</p>
                    <p>Almost three-fourths of the members of the Central Committee has come under
                        serious attack during various phases of the Cultural Revolution. For all
                        practical purposes the Party in the capital has become <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and a small group of his
                        subordinates.</p>
                    <p>The most significant change in the scene during the past month has been the
                        rapid growth of power in the hands of the Army. The Army has not yet clearly
                        indicated its support of either major faction. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s immediate coterie, however, clearly regards the Army
                        as having contributed to the “adverse current” in the Cultural
                        Revolution.</p>
                    <p>The vaunted “three way alliance” (Army, revolutionary rebels and good cadres)
                        are an attempt to cover up the fact that the Army controls the country. The
                        not very successful attempt ever since January 23 to use the Army against
                        the opposition causes the Revolution to take on more of the aspect of an
                        attempted military coup by a minority in the Party against the majority
                        rather than of a manifestation of the revolutionary militancy of the masses
                        in attacking the bourgeoisie, which is the way the regime has attempted to
                        portray the Revolution.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Army has its own problems. Two of its most powerful and
                        respected old-timers are in disrepute. Hsu Hsiang-chien, Vice Chairman of
                        the Military Affairs Committee and head of the Army's Cultural Revolution
                        Committee, has apparently been relieved of both posts, and Yeh Chien-ying,
                        also a member of the Military Affairs Committee, has been excoriated in a
                        poster reporting that a recent meeting of the <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0583"/>Committee broke up without deciding issues it meant to deal
                        with. Even Madame <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s perceptivity
                        was equal to observing “the situation in the Army is hardly
                        understandable.”</p>
                    <p>There has been a recent upsurge of Red Guard sanctimonious hooliganism in
                        Peking, along with reports of serious dissension within their ranks.
                        Military control in Peking, however, is much tighter than when the Red
                        Guards ran riot in January and there have been expressions of resentment
                        that the Army's curbing of them is interfering with the Revolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>'s prestige has again
                        risen with reports that he heads a six-man “presidium” of the Communist
                        Party. The role of this organization is not yet clear but it probably will
                        be charged with continuing efforts to eliminate Chief of State Liu Shao-chi,
                        Party Secretary Teng Hsiao-ping, and former Propaganda Chief Tao Chu.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> remains technically the
                        heir apparent, but his chances are still not very apparent to me.</p>
                    <p>Barring a palace coup or sudden crumbling of the support of either faction,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s great struggle to retain
                        power will primarily be determined by the manner and success of the Army's
                        application of power and the performance of the economy, particularly in the
                        agriculture realm. The former will be chiefly affected by a reading of
                        Peking power realities and the reaction of the masses of Chinese citizens to
                        the Army's exercise of power. The latter, of course, depends largely upon
                        weather (so far better than average) and peasant-worker application, about
                        which we simply know too little as yet. At the moment all we can say is that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s opposition has little
                        cause to believe that they are losing by playing the waiting game.</p>

                    <p>An April 29, 1967, memorandum from Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield to
                        President <persName>Johnson</persName> put forward several proposals
                        pertaining to the Vietnam conflict. The first proposal, headed “An Approach
                        Via China,” argued that because U.S. bombing of North Vietnam would make it
                        ever more heavily dependent on China, “The road to settlement with Hanoi,
                        now, very likely runs by way of Peking rather than Moscow.” Mansfield
                        proposed making a “quiet and clearly conciliatory approach to China.” He
                        suggested that he might try to arrange a trip to Peking. He thought such a
                        trip, to be effective, would need at least tacit Presidential approval and
                        should be designed to get from <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou
                            En-Lai</persName> “the Chinese view of what is needed for a settlement
                        in Viet Nam and for the restoration of more normal relations throughout the
                        Western Pacific.”</p>

                        stated that, after reading and considering Mansfield's proposals, Secretary
                        of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was “strongly opposed”
                        to a visit by Mansfield to Communist China, which would be “a major
                        intervention in a troubled situation,” would make the Soviet Union upset and
                        suspicious, and would cause great confusion among “our friends in free
                        Asia.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believed,
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> stated, “the proper way to proceed with
                        respect to Communist China was to elevate the Warsaw talks to the Foreign
                        Ministers level,” but he was “hesitant to propose this until the situation
                        within Communist China has somewhat settled down.”
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> noted that he was in general agreement with

                    <p>3385. 1. Yesterday afternoon Gimo and Madame <persName>Chiang</persName>
                        hosted large party in honor of US military, commemorating establishment of
                            <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> 16 years ago. This annual event
                        was unusually large this year, with over 1,000 Americans invited.</p>
                    <p>2. Gimo asked me to arrive early so we could have half hour of private
                        discussion just before party. Madame <persName>Chiang</persName> was
                        present, also <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName>. Fred Chien interpreted.</p>
                    <p>3. In somewhat emotional, and clearly sincere presentation,<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">A memorandum of the conversation was sent with airgram
                            A–740 from Taipei, dated May 3. (Ibid, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1 <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">CHINAT</gloss>)</note>
                        Gimo made the following points, directed at me as an old friend. Whether or
                        not I wished to pass them on would, he said, be up to me.</p>
                    <p>4. (A) Gimo said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has not always
                        immediately understood the steadfastness and seriousness with which <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> views its responsibilities as ally of US.
                        He stated his actions have always been based on moral principle, and will
                        always be so based. Gimo repeatedly assured me that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will never do anything contrary to its commitments, or
                        contrary to interest of US, which Gimo views as inseparable from interest of
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. (B) Gimo said he has often stated that the return to the mainland will be
                        70 percent political and 30 percent military. Up until recently <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has had the view that the 30 percent of
                        military action should precede political action, but now, Gimo explicitly
                        stated, he intends to utilize political means first, after which at later
                        time some military action may be necessary “to clean up the mess.”</p>
                    <p>6. (C) Breakdown and fragmentation of authority on the mainland, and general
                        disillusionment with communism, has created a situation where GRC political
                        efforts can be successful, and will be welcomed, Gimo said. He intends to
                        take seriously his responsibilities as an ally of the US to do what he can
                        to assure the peace and security of the area, primarily through political
                        means.</p>
                    <p>7. Comment: Because interview was terminated by Gimo immediately after his
                        long presentation, in order to join reception, I had no opportunity to probe
                        for explanation of what sort of political means <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has in mind. However, I doubt that any major political
                        demarche toward mainland is imminent and I take the Gimo's remarks to be
                        intended primarily <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0587"/>as a plea for
                        greater trust and understanding on the part of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, as well as an appeal for the US to refrain from taking any
                        action that will damage <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests.</p>
                    <p>8. We have from time to time heard this sort of earnest appeal from Gimo
                        before. A conversation I had with <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> on April 20 along
                        similar lines (being reported by <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>)<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">Reference is apparently to
                            a conversation on April 28 with <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName>, reported in telegram 3390 from Taipei, May 2.
                            (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">CHINAT</gloss>-US)</note> was obviously
                        intended to lay the groundwork for the Gimo's presentation. Neither the Gimo
                        nor <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> gave any
                        indication that their remarks were related to current problems surrounding
                        preparations for visit to Washington of Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName>. However, I am sure that these problems
                        (particularly wording of joint statement) which were aired in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Cabinet meeting April 27, comprise one of
                        the stimuli that have caused the Gimo's appeal.</p>
                    <p>9. Putting political action before military was clearly foreshadowed in
                        Gimo's New Years Day message, and the Gimo undoubtedly considers his
                        explicit statements to me (and <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName>'s also) as a major concession to US views as well
                        as realistic response to current mainland situation.</p>

                        <item>Whatever the outcome of the current political crisis, any Chinese
                            leadership will probably continue to work towards a dominant position in
                            Asia and great power status on the world scene. It will probably
                            continue to be concerned by the danger of conflict with the US, and
                            possibly with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Thus China will
                            almost certainly continue to give high priority to improving its
                            military capabilities.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Although the threat of force and its actual use beyond China's borders
                            are significant elements in Peking's outlook, Chinese military strategy
                            places primary emphasis on defense. With the possible exception of their
                            nuclear/missile activities, we do not see in train the general programs,
                            the development or deployment of forces, or the doctrinal discussions
                            which would suggest a more forward strategy. At least for the short
                            term, the high priority nuclear program is probably viewed by the
                            Chinese as primarily for deterrence, though Peking's successes in this
                            field bring substantial prestige and political influence, particularly
                            in Asia.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>In our view, Chinese forces are capable of providing a strong defense
                            of the Mainland and launching significant offensive operations in
                            neighboring areas. Thus far the political turmoil does not seem to have
                            affected these Chinese capabilities or military production programs in
                            any significant way.</item>

                            face an increasingly difficult problem in allocating scarce economic

                        commitments and obligations to the United States as a close ally.<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">See <ref target="#d256">Document 256</ref>.</note> Vice
                        President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> mentioned his
                        President's statement that his Government would never do anything which was
                        inimical to U.S. interests and would continue to regard basic U.S. interests
                        as being in line with the basic interests of his own Government. The Vice
                        President said President <persName>Chiang</persName> hoped that the U.S.
                        Government felt the same way.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then turned to the situation on mainland China. He said it
                        was the assessment of his Government that the conflict on the <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0591"/>mainland would continue. There had been no
                        physical liquidation by <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> of the
                        opposition leaders so far, but this did not mean that the struggle was not
                        intense. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> had refrained from
                        moving toward the full liquidation of his opponents only because he feared a
                        widespread adverse reaction to such an extreme measure—a reaction which he
                        could not control at this time.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President identified three stages in the cultural upheaval on the
                        mainland as follows: (1) the public denunciation in Shanghai in 1965 of
                        certain writings identified with Liu Shao-chi; (2) the development of the
                        full fury of the Cultural Revolution, May–August 1966; (3) the emergence of
                        the full-fledged open “power struggle,” beginning in Shansi in January
                        1967.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said the origins of the conflict go back seven years to
                        about 1960 when the former Defense Minister, predecessor of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>, was liquidated. The Vice
                        President thought that no one leader or faction is in effective control on
                        the mainland now. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is now
                        branding all of his opponents indiscriminately as “Revisionists.” The word
                        is being used very loosely without any precise meaning, other than that it
                        means anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>. Liu Shao-chi
                        actually does not have a historical record of being pro-Soviet; nor does the
                        Governor and military commander of Sinkiang Province, Wang En-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, have a pro-Soviet record either.
                            <persName>Wang</persName> helped to defeat the Soviet effort some years
                        ago to set up an “East Turk-estan Autonomous Republic.”</p>
                    <p>The tactic of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is to vilify his
                        opponents in every way he can. The revolution has become something
                        distasteful to almost everybody except the pro-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> group and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        seems to take satisfaction in openly characterizing his revolution as
                        something which is violent and something to be feared. He openly uses the
                        Chinese phrase “tsao fan” (to make rebellion) in describing his own
                        movement. The Vice President estimates the opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is still very strong. Liu and other
                        elements still have a considerable following and this limits <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s freedom of action. The Vice
                        President's conclusion is that the fight will go on. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> cannot quell the dissenters, not all
                        of whom are pro-Liu. There is a large anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> group of Communists who now have something in common
                        with the majority of the people, who are not identified with the Communist
                        Party but who have been fairly neutral so far. As the economic situation
                        deteriorates further, the continuing struggle will produce a steady growth
                        in anti-Communist sentiment.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> considered
                        that the efforts against the Chinese Communists should be “70 per cent
                        political” and only 30 per cent military. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has “many agents” working on the mainland. The tactics
                        being used by the agents are different from what they were before 1959. They
                        are now instructed to mingle openly with the people, posing as fanatical
                        pro-Communists. Some pretend that they are pro-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0592"/>and some
                        pro-Liu. They are trying to broaden and deepen the conflict. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> predicts that the turmoil will lead to
                        disastrous results, especially as to production of basic food requirements.
                        It is believed that spring planting is down at least 11 per cent. The grain
                        loss will be seriously felt in the fall. With the further deterioration of
                        the food situation, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believes that
                        anti-Communist sentiment will grow and the discontent will lead to an
                        expansion of the fighting.</p>
                    <p>Answering a question of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s about <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou
                        En-Lai</persName>, the Vice President doubted that <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> could ever become a “third force” in
                        the Communist hierarchy. He was well-known to many <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders, and he was clearly identified as a man who always
                        tried to side with the winner. He had once been close to Teng Hsiao-ping,
                        the No. 2 man in the Liu group. Then he had wavered when he thought the Liu
                        group was losing ground and had gone over to the <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> side. He had then tried to exercise a
                        mediating influence between the Red Guards and the Communist Party elements.
                        He had then been subjected to some censure. He did not have the strength to
                        emerge as a third force. <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> would be used by <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> as long as the struggle continued, and
                        that he would lose favor with <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        after the eventual purge of Liu. He would have a place of some importance
                        during the struggle.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought that the regime and the
                        entire country were in a state of confusion. The regime was not capable of
                        effective control. Both the Army and the Party were split and disorganized.
                        How can a regime which cannot control Army or Party control the country?
                        There was a probability of further dissension and eventual purges. In this
                        situation the chances for a reunified China under a different leadership
                        were greater than ever before. In this connection, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> said, “We have our aspirations.”</p>
                    <p>The Vice President referred to the urgent efforts of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s to develop nuclear weapons. He
                        thought that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> information on <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear weapons progress tallied
                        closely with U.S. information. He mentioned our close consultation and
                        effective exchange of information on this subject. <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had hoped to have their sixth
                        nuclear test on the Red Holiday, May 1. They had missed this date, but
                            <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought the next explosion
                        would come soon.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> spoke of the feverish preparations
                        of the Communists for war. Despite the economic failures and the poverty of
                        the people, a population of 700 million has a high productive capacity. By
                        ruthlessly lowering the living standard of the people still further, the
                        Communists can accumulate large resources for production of nuclear weapons.
                        Even though the regime had immense troubles, these troubles themselves make
                        the regime more aggressive and not less so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought that Sino-Soviet relations
                        would not change essentially. The rift between the Soviets and the <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> faction is getting worse, but <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0593"/>some sort of agreement apparently
                        has been reached permitting the freer transit of Soviet war material
                        overland to North Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName>
                        thought that the agreement was only “technical” and did not signify any real
                        improvement of relations. It was a renewal of a 1965 transit agreement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said there were some
                        reports that the transit agreement provided for the delivery of the arms
                        supplies to North Vietnamese personnel at the Sino-Soviet border.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName>Bundy</persName> said he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> and noted that he did not believe that
                        the Soviet transit traffic across China to North Viet-Nam had ever been
                        significantly interfered with.</p>
                    <p>In response to a query as to the relative influence of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and the Soviets in North Viet-Nam,
                            <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> said he thought the Chinese
                        Communists have more influence and are pulling most of the strings. The
                        Chinese Communists have the advantage of proximity and can control the land
                        supply route. They can give a green light or a red light. The sea route of
                        supply is difficult at best and places the Soviets under a handicap.
                            <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought that the Liberation
                        Front in South Viet-Nam did not listen entirely to Ho Chi-minh's orders. The
                        Liberation Front were mostly trained in Communist China and they are
                        responsive to Chinese Communist direction. This gives the Chinese Communists
                        as much influence over the Viet Cong as anyone. In other remarks <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> also suggested that Peking had some
                        control over Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought that the number of Chinese
                        Communist personnel in North Viet-Nam might run as high as 60,000 to 80,000,
                        although he could not be sure. The Chinese Communist disposition of
                        personnel in North Viet-Nam is ostensibly for defense of the Chinese border,
                        but the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> elements in North Viet-Nam
                        watch Hanoi very closely.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> said that the Generalissimo points
                        out that the “root of the evil” is on the mainland. Of 10 Chinese Communist
                        Army Field Marshals, one, Marshal Lo, has been purged. All the others,
                        except <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName>, have been censured.
                        16 Communist deputy prime ministers had been disgraced in one form or
                        another. At the provincial level, thousands and thousands of officials have
                        been removed. There is dissension on a big scale. An immense effort is being
                        made against <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is heavily burdened by external
                        problems as well as his major internal challenge. President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> is convinced of the necessity for the allies
                        to think ahead and plan for the long pull as well as the immediate crises.
                        The Generalissimo believes we should think in terms of 20 to 30 years.</p>
                    <p>In response to a query from the President as to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> view of the likely course of the war in Viet-Nam, Vice
                        President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> noted that the United
                        States and allied forces in Viet-Nam are far superior. But control of much
                        of the countryside by the enemy poses a difficult problem which must be
                        dealt with by political as well as military means. Pacification is a
                        difficult task but is an indispensable part of the over-all effort to
                        counter <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0594"/>the Liberation Front. Rural
                        development work is of prime importance. Communist control of “the surface”
                        between the urban centers gives the Communists a big advantage. The Vice
                        President said his Government considers that the emphasis which the United
                        States, since the Honolulu Conference, has accorded to pacification and
                        effective civil government is correct. The Vice President mentioned the
                        technical assistance which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is
                        contributing in Viet-Nam, which he termed of modest proportions.</p>
                    <p>In response to another question from the President, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> said that his Government held the view
                        that the Soviet Union would not come to the assistance of the Chinese
                        Communists in any foreseeable international situation, and he thought they
                        would not directly intervene in the Chinese Communist internal struggle,
                        although they were naturally hoping for the downfall of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> as to what outcome of the struggle in Communist China
                        would be best from the standpoint of U.S. interests, the Vice President said
                        he thought the conflict would go on for a long time in any event, and that a
                        victory by either side could not be beneficial in any way. He felt that a
                        victorious Liu Shao-chi might in the long run pose an even greater threat
                        than <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> to the Free World, despite
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s violent and ruthless
                        extremism. Liu has never actually been pro-Soviet, but he could be forced
                        into a pro-Soviet position. A united front of the two large Communist powers
                        which would then emerge would be the greatest threat to the Free World.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> thought that a
                        continuation of the present factional struggle on the mainland would be the
                        best situation from the standpoint of Free World interests. He thought that
                        continued conflict would encourage the now submerged anti-Communist
                        elements. The Vice President thought that the ordinary man on the mainland
                        is not interested in ideologies. The ordinary Chinese will not like the
                        sufferings that will come from economic failure. The people of the mainland
                        will see the great contrast between the breakdown on the mainland and the
                        success of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Hence, they will become more and
                        more anti-Communist. “This is what we are aspiring for,” the Vice President
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Responding to a question from the President as to whether the mainland
                        turmoil would probably tend to bring the Chinese Communists more directly
                        into the Vietnamese war or keep them out, the Vice President said the
                        Chinese Communist policy would be to keep the trouble going in Viet-Nam on
                        more or less its present scale. He thought that they would try to maintain
                        indefinitely about the present degree of U.S. involvement.</p>
                    <p>In answer to a further question from the President as to the circumstances
                        under which the Chinese Communists might be tempted to <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0595"/>intervene openly in Viet-Nam as they did in
                        Korea, the Vice President thought that the Chinese Communists would
                        deliberately avoid the sort of direct involvement which they chose in Korea.
                        He thought they would try to “fight by proxy,” avoiding a direct Sino-U.S.
                        confrontation, and at the same time preventing the North Vietnamese from
                        making a settlement of the war. The Vice President thought that the Chinese
                        Communists would use all necessary means to “sabotage” any peace talks.</p>
                    <p>Speaking to another question from the President as to what sort of solution
                        might be envisaged in such circumstances, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> felt that a solution could come about
                        only through the end of Communist control of mainland China, and he thought
                        this would eventually happen. The President interjected parenthetically that
                        he didn't see how this was to be done.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> said that President
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> had instructed him to reiterate that his
                        Government wishes to maintain close contact and frequent consultation with
                        the United States Government. The Vice President repeated his opening
                        remarks, saying that the Republic of China considered the interests of the
                        two countries should be identical. “We will do nothing contrary to United
                        States interests and we hope the United States will do nothing contrary to
                        ours.” The Vice President pointed out that the unpredictability of the
                        mainland situation made alertness and close consultation all the more
                        essential, adding “We will be building the Republic of China more and
                        more.”</p>
                    <p>The Vice President noted that the outbreak of a Cultural Revolution on the
                        mainland would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. Liu's No. 2 position in
                        the secession then seemed clear. The emergence of the Red Guards could not
                        have been imagined.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President noted that currently the 4th Field Army in Kwangtung
                        Province has shown some pro-Liu tendencies, and <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> has been compelled to move some other army units
                        into that area. The loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        of many units in the Communist Army is doubtful. In Fukien Province,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has removed General Yeh Fei,
                        an active political commissar. These are examples of widespread current
                        troubles facing the Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President predicted that the situation will gradually change in the
                        Free World's favor. At the same time he cautioned that there is no room for
                        complacency and his Government clearly understands the necessity to work
                        hard to accelerate and intensify the changes which are causing such trouble
                        to the Communist regime.</p>

                        terminated with the thanks of the President for the helpful presentation by
                        the Vice President of the views of his Government on these questions.</p>

                    <p>During his call on the Secretary May 10, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName>, after a discussion of recent mainland
                        developments, told the Secretary he hoped the United States would continue
                        to support the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the United Nations. He
                        said that since the days of President Kennedy, the United States had assured
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> of support. The Secretary
                        interjected humorously to say that United States support for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the United Nations dated back to the
                        days of Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean
                            Rusk</persName>. The Secretary went on to say that there may be some
                        difference on tactics between us but our purpose has not changed. The voting
                        situation in the General Assembly has changed from what it was years ago and
                        we also have many nervous friends. In the last General Assembly, for
                        example, Canada could have shaken many apples off the tree and we might as a
                        result have lost five or six essential votes. The Secretary noted that
                        events on the mainland have probably helped rather than harmed our position
                        on Chinese representation in the United Nations. He thought that the events
                        of the Cultural Revolution must have caused great revulsion among
                        intellectuals on the mainland. He said we would like to talk with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> about ways of stimulating this revulsion
                        and giving it a push.</p>
                    <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0597"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> told the Secretary that he would
                        visit Expo 67 at the invitation of the Canadian Government on China's
                        National Day next October. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> commented that, in regard to the previously expressed
                        Canadian intention to recognize Red China, the Chinese Communists were
                        taking a very rigid position which helped the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in Canada. The Secretary said that he wanted to make it
                        clear that there had been no U.S. collusion with the Canadian initiative in
                        the General Assembly last year, and he described in some detail our problems
                        in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> on Chinese
                        representation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Liu said he would like to take advantage of this unusual summit
                        meeting to consult together on Chinese representation tactics. He said that
                        the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taipei was reverting to the “<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> tactic” of a moratorium formula.
                        He has already exchanged views with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> on this and Ambassador Liu realized that there were
                        difficulties in seeking a moratorium. Liu then went on to say that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attaches great importance to President
                        Kennedy's assurance, contained in a letter, with respect to the Security
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it is not 100% clear that there could be a veto on
                        the credentials question. We think so, but it is not certain that we would
                        find agreement on this. The Secretary also pointed out that, if we were to
                        say we will veto admission of Communist China in the Security Council,
                        others would be able to get a free ride, confident that the United States
                        would prevent Communist China from being admitted. On the other hand, if we
                        plan our tactics carefully, we should be able to get a sufficient number of
                        abstentions for the vote to fail without ever needing to veto.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Liu noted that of the Security Council's fifteen votes, only nine
                        were in our favor. Liu added that the Security Council has not met since
                        January and that this month the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from the Secretary, Ambassador Liu said that he had
                        no reason to think the Soviets are planning an initiative and Fedorenko had
                        given it as his personal view that the Soviets would not take an initiative
                        on Chinese representation in the Security Council. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> interposed that the Soviets in Geneva
                        recently had used a new formula containing the clause that “Formosa does not
                        represent China.” He thought this might foreshadow some new Soviet attitude.
                        Ambassador Liu observed that there is no evidence of a change in the Soviet
                        attitude in the United Nations itself.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Liu then said that, from the point of view of his Government
                        domestically, President Kennedy's assurance has importance as showing that
                        the United States proposed to use the veto if necessary. The Secretary
                        commented that domestic political needs in Taiwan may sometimes cut across
                        the subtle needs of winning international support for our position on
                        Chinese representation in the United Nations.</p>
                    <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0598"/>
                    <p>Returning to the question of a moratorium, Ambassador Liu said he thought
                        that having discussed Chinese representation now for five sessions, the
                        General Assembly might this year want to put the subject aside. The
                        Secretary replied that he thought we ought to look at this together. We had
                        not expected the moratorium to last as many years as it did. We were not
                        sure that a moratorium would, in fact, be possible this year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, invited to comment by the
                        Secretary, said it was necessary that we look at the situation in the United
                        Nations very carefully before deciding as to tactics. The events on the
                        mainland were two-edged, he thought; in some respects helpful to our
                        position but, in other respects, working against it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> thought Soviet statements in the
                        specialized agencies, such as the one referred to by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName>, were “record” statements. It was
                        necessary to watch the Soviets in the United Nations itself in judging their
                        attitude. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> went on to say
                        that we have reservations as the possibilities of a moratorium being agreed
                        to in the next General Assembly. The only safe thing, he thought, is to
                        assume that the Albanian resolution will be proposed again this year. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said that we had done a
                        good job in educating many new members how to deal with the Chinese
                        representation issue substantively, and that reversion to the moratorium
                        tactic would be both confusing and ineffective. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yen</persName> commented at the close of this portion
                        of the conversation that we must have close cooperation between us in
                        Chinese representation.</p>

                        <item>It was generally agreed that Ambassador Sullivan's specific
                            suggestions as to courses of action by which Taiwan might be kept
                            separate from the mainland are not realistic, although it was recognized
                            that these were offered only as possible starting points for a
                            consideration of the problem. Specifically, it was felt that the notion
                            of positioning a ready reserve division in Taiwan as a means of
                            persuading the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to reduce its force
                            levels and, perhaps, as a bargaining counter vis-a-vis the Chinese
                            Communists was entirely infeasible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> pointed out that such a move would be exploited
                            by the Chinese Communists as proof of the U.S. “occupation” of Taiwan,
                            would be suspect by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and most
                            unlikely to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to reduce
                            its military strength.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>There also was general agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHW1">Jacobson</persName>'s view that U.S. policies and actions should
                            not be directed to precluding either the permanent separation of Taiwan
                            from the mainland or eventual unification of Taiwan with the mainland
                            should the people so desire; rather our position should remain flexible
                            so that we can respond, in a manner which will best serve our national
                            interests, to changes likely to take place both on the mainland and in
                            Taiwan. The discussion did not focus specifically on the question of
                            whether U.S. national interests will best be served by maintaining
                            Taiwan separate from the mainland, although it was agreed that this is
                            the practical thrust of our present policies.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>It was agreed that no basic change in the position of Taiwan as
                            defined by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is likely during the
                            lifetime of President <persName>Chiang</persName>. There was a
                            difference of opinion, however, concerning the degree of support within
                            Taiwan for remaining separate from the mainland which might be present
                            should such change become possible. On the one hand, it was pointed out
                            that as the island continues to develop economically, and as younger
                            mainlanders come into position of responsibility, many mainlanders, as
                            well as Taiwanese, will become increasingly reluctant to have Taiwan
                            rejoined with the mainland, to which there will be a gradually declining
                            sense of commitment and identification. On the other hand, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> noted that with the passage of
                            time and changes in leadership, those in control on the mainland may
                            find it in their interests to reach some compromise with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and be willing to make substantial
                            concessions to that end. He suggested as one possibility an arrangement
                            under which the government on Taiwan would retain independent control of
                            domestic affairs, including major economic and trade policies, but would
                            have a single Foreign Office with the mainland. (Others, however,
                            pointed out that this would be wholly inconsistent with policies adapted
                            by the Communist regime to date—such as their relations with so-called
                            “autonomous areas.”)</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> suggested that the
                            “Taiwan problem” should be approached from the question of the
                            significance and implications of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            occupation of the Offshore Islands. In this connection, there was <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0600"/>considerable discussion as to
                            the probable effect of a U.S. decision not to assist the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in retaining control of the Offshores.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> thought it quite
                            likely that even if the Chinese Communists were reasonably confident
                            that the United States would not assist the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in defending the Offshore Islands, they would not
                            necessarily attempt to seize them. He suggested that for the Chinese
                            Communists the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> occupation of the
                            Offshores not only symbolizes the continuation of the civil war but the
                            direct association of Taiwan with the mainland. To drive the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from the Offshores would be to confirm
                            its separation from the mainland. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRN1">Clough</persName>, however, thought that the Chinese Communists
                            might consider it to their advantage to administer a decisive military
                            and political defeat to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, since
                            this could seriously weaken morale on Taiwan to the extent that the
                            Chinese Communists might be able to force a political settlement. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Bennett</persName> also noted that in
                            view of <persName>Chiang</persName>'s determination to hold the
                            Offshores alone, if necessary, any indication that the United States
                            would not come to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s assistance
                            even should its forces on the Offshores face certain defeat could only
                            be regarded by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as tantamount to
                            the abandonment by the United States of its commitments under the Mutual
                            Defense Treaty. This could have a serious adverse impact across the
                            entire range of our relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>It was agreed that no useful purpose would be served by undertaking a
                            staff study along the lines proposed by Ambassador Sullivan. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> suggested that it
                            would be useful, prior to the next Chiefs of Mission Conference, to
                            prepare a brief memorandum addressed to the general problem as a
                            reference paper for the conference. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Bennett</persName> noted that in commenting on Ambassador
                            Sullivan's views, <gloss target="#t_EAROC1">EA/ROC</gloss> had
                            recommended that a study be undertaken by <gloss target="#t_EAROC1">EA/ROC</gloss>, together with <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>,
                            addressed to the question of whether it is in the long-range U.S.
                            interest that Taiwan be kept separate from or rejoined to the mainland.
                            He stated that he continued to believe that, apart from the merits of
                            Ambassador Sullivan's specific proposals, such a study would be
                            worthwhile. No conclusion was reached on this point, however.</item>

                        defense of Hong Kong, so far as we can determine. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Treaty area is limited to Europe, North
                        America and the North Atlantic, and the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty area appears to have been specifically delineated
                        to exclude Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>However, Mr. <persName>Livingston Merchant</persName>, on December 1, 1960,
                        advised British Ambassador Caccia that “it went without saying that were the
                        British to be threatened or attacked there [at Hong Kong],<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note> we would give them
                        such support as seemed appropriate at the time.” Subsequently, Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> was authorized to discuss
                        defense plans with Lord Mountbatten, but Mountbatten “made no attempt to
                        find out what Cincpac might be able to do” and <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> did not volunteer information. British staff officers
                        did advise their U.S. counterparts in March 1961 that they had done all they
                        could “to convince the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s that if
                        they attacked Hong Kong, that U.S. would respond with nuclear weapons.”
                        According to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, his staff
                        listened.</p>
                    <p>A working group has been recently constituted to update the 1962 Hong Kong
                        policy paper,<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Reference is to a paper entitled
                            “Hong Kong: Guidelines for Policy and Operations,” prepared by the

                            and agencies and issued in November 1962. The portion quoted is

                            <item>In general, we have no information to indicate that any serious
                                shooting incidents have occurred in recent months between Soviet and
                                Chinese Communist forces in border areas. However, there have been
                                several probably true reports of local small-scale “incidents,”
                                including along Amur River, and both sides have probably stepped up
                                their security precautions all along the border. In February and
                                March, Red Guard newspapers in Peking mentioned border incidents,
                                and February 22 speech by the Soviet Deputy Defense Minister
                                confirmed that shooting incident had taken place at Blagoveshchensk
                                earlier that month. We expect border tensions to continue but doubt
                                that any large-scale outbreaks will occur.</item>

                            <item>The Soviets clearly have increased their propaganda directed at
                                the ethnic minorities in Chinese border areas such as Sinkiang and
                                Inner Mongolia. Small numbers of Kazakhs and Uighurs apparently have
                                fled from Sinkiang across the border, and Soviets have used some of
                                them to broadcast horrendous details about Red Guards' treatment
                                ethnic minority groups under Cultural Revolution. Red Guard
                                newspaper article in March claimed Soviets also sending subversive
                                agents to penetrate into Communist China, but whether or not
                                significant volume such activities actually occurring has not been
                                confirmed.</item>

                            <item>In two Chinese border areas, Inner Mongolia and Sinkiang, period
                                of uneasy relative calm apparently prevails now. Serious violence
                                was instigated in those regions by Red Guards last January and
                                earlier February, but then modus vivendi between Peking and local
                                authorities was reached. Last month, Peking apparently upset this
                                arrangement in Inner Mongolia, and there have been reports of
                                removal Ulanfu (Party boss of Mongol ethnic derivation who had
                                served there for fifteen years) and of reorganization military
                                leadership there. In Sinkiang, long-time Party-military leadership
                                headed by Wang En-mao still holds on although there is danger of
                                resurgent Red Guard conflict and increased opposition from ethnic
                                minority groups.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>The political situation throughout the Chinese mainland today is complex and
                        uncertain.</p>
                    <p>While there is no good evidence that any area is not reasonably well
                        controlled by the central government, Peking press and radio have praised
                        the leadership of only four provinces (Heilungkiang, Shansi, Shantung and
                        Kweichow) and two municipalities (Shanghai and Peking). Peking is pointedly
                        silent about the remaining 22 provinces. Since May 1, Red Guards have
                        reported disorder in five provinces (Szechwan, Tibet, Kansu, Sinkiang and
                        Honan). As a minimum, this suggests that Peking leaders are in serious
                        conflict over the selection of leaders there.</p>
                    <p>Lurid reports of violence in the provinces, circulated by Red Guards and
                        picked up by the world press, are largely, though by no means entirely,
                        discounted by the intelligence community. Fairly widespread disorder has
                        occurred, but it is suspected that exaggerated reports are issued in order
                        to discredit local officials slated for purge. Communications and
                        transportation services, including those involving the Army, <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0605"/>have functioned normally since February,
                        without anomalies attributable to unrest.</p>
                    <p>The Army has generally responded to central orders since late January,
                        although it has tended to act more in the interest of stability than in
                        support of the Maoists as such.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s “extensive democracy” (turning
                        to the masses for support) has been fairly effective as a weapon of
                        destruction. However, it is at a loss when the time comes to construct a
                        meaningful alternative to the destroyed structure. Unity fostered by
                        targeting conservative “demons” then dissolves into bickering among the
                        leftists over the share of the spoils. Peking has aptly termed this
                        phenomenon “unprincipled ‘civil wars.’” The regime has had to resort to
                        increased reliance on the Army and renewed policy emphasis on law and
                        order—at the expense of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                        revolutionary objectives. The revolution is in a highly nervous
                        stalemate.</p>

                            intelligence/incursion operation against the Fukien coast on 6 May ended
                            in disaster, with a small boat and at least seven men lost as a result
                            of Chinese Communist attack. Operations of this kind continue to be

                            China. The “program”, which was approved by Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> on 3 March,
                            specifically rejects a military “counter-attack” because of the
                            “international situation” and because it would reunify the Communists.
                            It calls for political and psychological warfare measures, and in doing

                        <item>The political crisis in China continues. No end is in sight. Among the
                            several possible outcomes, no one is distinctly more likely than others.
                            But whatever its ultimate resolution, the Great Proletarian Cultural
                            Revolution has already done immense damage to the top leadership and the
                            party, has profoundly altered the internal power structure, has greatly
                            unsettled all levels of Chinese society, has unleashed new forces of
                            instability, and has contributed to China's growing isolation in the
                            world.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>We have no evidence that the Cultural Revolution has yet had any
                            significant effects on the military capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> or on China's advanced weapons
                            programs. But the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> is assuming more
                            and more noncombat tasks and if this trend long continues it would
                            almost certainly affect its combat capabilities.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Instability and confusion are likely to persist so long as <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> retains sufficient power and vigor
                            to push his designs for remoulding the party and combating real and
                            imagined threats to his doctrines and policies. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> could misjudge his power position
                            and go too far. He is now heavily dependent on the military for support;
                            too vigorous efforts to bridle the armed forces could produce a coup
                            against <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> or even
                            fragmentation of the country and civil war. But these are extreme cases
                            and we think it more likely that a basic tendency toward preservation of
                            national unity will persist, despite the divisive impact of the Cultural
                            Revolution.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>Looking beyond <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, the
                            Cultural Revolution has made it more likely that the succession will be
                            a disorderly and contentious struggle. The military may play a decisive
                            role, but <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin Piao</persName> would not
                            necessarily be their candidate. A collective including <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>, some of the military
                            leaders, and even some of the now disgraced party figures, might emerge.
                            In any event we believe that many of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s dogmas and practices <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0608"/>are likely to be set aside. This might be a gradual
                            process, though it could come more rapidly if unresolved internal and
                            external problems have been aggravated during the last months or years
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s rule.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>The political crisis has already focused the leadership's energies and
                            attention on internal affairs and has at least temporarily damaged
                            Chinese prestige abroad. Within this context, however, China has
                            maintained a relatively active foreign policy, though it has become more
                            rigid in international Communist affairs. For the most part Peking has
                            maintained policy positions which were well established before the
                            Cultural Revolution began. As long as the Maoists retain control, Peking
                            is unlikely to make any important changes in the general line of its
                            foreign policy. At any rate, in the short term, an unremitting hostility
                            to the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to remain
                            the predominant feature of Chinese foreign policy. It is possible,
                            however, that over the longer term, internal changes in the direction of
                            moderation, if they do occur, will create more favorable conditions for
                            reappraising foreign policy and perhaps for introducing elements of
                            greater moderation.</item>

                        <item>It is our turn to open. In general we anticipate that atmosphere in
                            which this meeting takes place likely to be cooler than for some time.
                            Current meeting considered from our standpoint primarily as “holding
                            operation” in which our minimum objective is to keep open some dialogue
                            with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. Our opening statement
                            is considerably briefer than at last meeting and we would hope this
                            would set framework for general brief, uncomplicated session. We
                            anticipate, however, <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0609"/>will focus very hard on
                            Vietnam, question of US use of Thai bases, alleged violations of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> territorial air and water and
                            other incidents, and US-Soviet and US–<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> collusion against Peking. Your opening statement deals
                            with some of these points in effort blunt <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> attack in advance. In general, we believe that in
                            rebuttal you should not become involved in detailed comments on US
                            military actions in Vietnam other than to emphasize that US actions not
                            aimed at Peking and general comments on US purposes in undertaking
                            military involvement in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_KPH1">Kreisberg</persName> will provide you with additional material on
                            specific anticipated <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            allegations, including possibly Hong Kong. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We do not wish Hong Kong to become involved in Warsaw
                            talks, at this point at least, other than in our replying in low key to

                            vessels and personnel at port. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.

                            reiterate a point I made at our last meeting in January: that my
                            Government believes it is useful for these meetings, even though they
                            may be brief, to take place at more frequent intervals than every 4–1/2
                            months, particularly in a period such as the present. I realize this
                            anticipates our consideration later today of the time for our next
                            meeting, but I wish to underline the importance which my Government
                            attaches to the opportunity which these meetings present for our two
                            sides to frankly and openly exchange views on matters of mutual concern
                            and interest.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I have set forth in previous meetings my Government's
                            position on the conflict in Vietnam. I have emphasized our willingness
                            and fervent hope to find some means of ending the conflict and enabling
                            the people of South Vietnam to resolve their own political problems
                            peacefully and in their own way so that they may get about the urgent
                            tasks of improving their lives and those of their children. I have
                            indicated to you here in these meetings, and more importantly, my
                            Government has made clear to the Government of North Vietnam, that we
                            are ready at any time to discuss with them how this can best and most
                            rapidly be achieved.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, the US is prepared at this very moment to discuss
                            arrangements for a general stand-still truce, to enter into preliminary
                            talks with the Government of North Vietnam, and to participate in a
                            reconvened Geneva Conference. We are prepared to halt the bombing of
                            North Vietnam as a first step in a general effort to achieve a
                            de-escalation of the violence and a start on meaningful negotiations,
                            provided we receive the kind of assurances indicated in Amb. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s speech last September at the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We do not intend to invade North
                            Vietnam; we do not seek to overthrow the Government of North Vietnam; we
                            are not trying to change the political system in the North. We have
                            taken the actions <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0610"/>that we have
                            with deliberation and care to see that the area of the conflict not be
                            expanded. All our actions are directed at demonstrating to the GNVN that
                            its efforts to impose an arbitrary and unilateral political solution on
                            the people of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> will not succeed. We
                            believe that the interests of North Vietnam lie in seeking, through
                            confidential negotiations, an equitable peaceful settlement rather than
                            replying entirely on the use of force by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> directed forces in the South.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I shall not recapitulate all our efforts during the
                            last few years or during the most recent 4 months to find a means of
                            peacefully resolving this conflict. I am aware that your Government is
                            thus far not a direct party to this situation and there is no need for
                            me to go into detail on this subject. The GNVN, however, is well aware
                            of our efforts and my Government continues to be hopeful that these will
                            ultimately bear some fruit. I would only hope, Mr. Ambassador, that your
                            Government will lend its moral support and encouragement to those
                            efforts which men of good will of virtually all political persuasions
                            throughout the world are making to bring this conflict to an end. I
                            would further hope that your Government's firm support for 'the people
                            of Vietnam', of which you spoke at our last meeting, will be exerted
                            with equal firmness to any efforts by the GNVN to achieve an honorable
                            and just settlement of the conflict through negotiations.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, repeatedly during the last 4–1/2 months, radio
                            broadcasts and official announcements by your Government have alleged US
                            harassment and firing on vessels of your country, intrusions into your
                            territorial air and water, and, in April and May, the shooting down of a
                            number of US aircraft. We have examined these allegations as they have
                            appeared. I continue to regret your Government's refusal to engage in
                            joint investigations of such incidents when this might be useful and
                            productive. We have ascertained one or two occasions when US aircraft
                            may have unintentionally and briefly intruded into your airspace. At
                            these times we have publicly acknowledged the facts. Our investigations
                            also revealed several occasions, including individual incidents on
                            February 25, April 7, and April 26, when vessels apparently belonging to
                            your country fired on US aircraft in the Gulf of Tonkin area without
                            provocation but without, I may add, eliciting counter-fire. We have
                            found, however, no basis whatsoever for the overwhelming preponderance
                            of your allegations. I am at a loss to understand the reasons for their
                            being made unless your authorities are simply misinformed by the sources
                            originating these stories.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>It should be clear to you that we have had no hesitation in
                            acknowledging intrusions into your territory when we are able to confirm
                            that such intrusions may accidentally and unintentionally have taken
                            place. This is because, as I have repeatedly told you, US Air Force <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0611"/>and Naval pilots are
                            specifically instructed and cautioned to fully respect the territorial
                            air and sea of your country.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>But, Mr. Ambassador, we find most puzzling the claims that your
                            Government has put forth relating to the shooting down of US fighter
                            aircraft on April 24 and May 1. As your Government must be aware, no US
                            aircraft intruded into your territorial air, none were shot down over
                            your territory, and no US aircraft were missing anywhere near your
                            frontiers during this period. If you have any further details on these
                            allegations. I should welcome them.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I must point out that allegations of incidents which have never taken
                            place not only create a needless atmosphere of tension; they also will
                            make more difficult the ascertaining of facts and their assessment
                            should such incidents actually occur.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, my Government has repeatedly assured your Government,
                            both publicly and through these meetings, that we intend no hostile
                            actions against your country, have no intention of interfering in the
                            internal affairs of the territory under your control, and that our
                            actions and military activities in Vietnam are not directed in any way
                            against your country. You have on a number of occasions chosen to
                            express your disbelief in these assurances. You are mistaken to do so,
                            and I would regret if I have been unable to convince you of this. I can
                            only reiterate what I have said before: our intentions are indeed as I
                            have stated them. We consider this forum as one in which each side must
                            be able to communicate to the other, in full frankness, matters relating
                            to policy and purpose. The dangers and risks of a misunderstanding are
                            too great for us to attempt to deceive or mislead your Government, as
                            you alleged at our last meeting.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Our objectives in Vietnam are, as I have said, limited. We have
                            exercised great restraint and intend to continue to do so to avoid
                            widening the scope or area of the conflict beyond Vietnam. We hope you
                            will understand this restraint and understand the limitations we have
                            imposed on ourselves. We are under no misapprehensions as to the degree
                            to which we differ over the reasons for the current conflict in Vietnam
                            and in our respective positions toward this conflict. But we strongly
                            hope that your Government can accept what we see as an irrefutable
                            premise: that an enlargement of the conflict beyond Vietnam and the
                            entry of new, outside elements into the Vietnam situation will create
                            grave and serious dangers which neither of our countries should wish to
                            see.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, it is my understanding that in recent years,
                            scientists and medical personnel of your country have experimented with
                            and successfully developed many traditional herbal cures for diseases.
                            The scientific and medical community of my country would welcome an
                            opportunity to share in the achievements made by the people and
                            scientists <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0612"/>of your country in
                            this area of herbal medicine and also in the treatment of certain
                            diseases, common to your country and mine, that I understand you have
                            effectively developed in recent years.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>We have for the last 18 months hoped that your Government would agree
                            to permit American doctors and public health personnel visit China to
                            exchange experiences and knowledge with their opposite numbers on your
                            side. We regret that your Government has thus far declined to facilitate
                            such exchanges. I would like to suggest at this point that scientists
                            and doctors in your country might make available samples of herbs and
                            herbal medicines and their experience in using these to interested and
                            qualified American scientists. In exchange, if this were desired by your
                            Government, I am sure arrangements could be made for recent American
                            developments in similar areas of research to be made available to
                            scientists and doctors of your country.</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>I hope your Government will consider this proposal seriously and not
                            reject it out of hand as a propaganda or political move. Its purpose is
                            genuinely to enable the people of our two countries, regardless of
                            political differences, to benefit from the achievements of science,
                            where it may be practiced.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Ambassador, I was disappointed at our last meeting to hear your
                            flat and immediate rejection of my remarks on the Americans presently
                            being held in prison in your country. I was glad that you agreed that we
                            have a perfect right to raise this issue in these meetings. But it is
                            more than merely the right to 'express my views', as I believe you put
                            it. This right I have in any event. It is a question rather of the
                            failure of your Government to fulfill a commitment into which we
                            entered, and had hoped you did as well, in good faith.</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>It is furthermore a question of compassion, particularly in the cases
                            of Bishop Walsh and Captain <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>. The fact that the Red Cross Societies of our two
                            countries may have had an exchange of correspondence on a visit by
                            members of Captain <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s family
                            to Peking does not exclude this subject from our discussions here. I
                            urge again that you transmit my request to your Government that Captain
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> be released
                            expeditiously and that, pending his release, his wife and brother be
                            allowed to visit him. In any event, after the passage of 21 months, I
                            would hope that we might be given some indication of how long your
                            authorities intend to continue to hold him. The pain and grief of
                            continued uncertainty should not be imposed on his wife and
                            family.</item>
                        <label>17.</label>
                        <item>I hope, in addition, Mr. Ambassador, that your Government will give me
                            a carefully considered reply to my appeal for the release of Bishop
                            Walsh in view of his age and health. It is certainly not 'interference
                            in your internal affairs' to raise this matter of obvious humanity. I,
                            of course, must emphasize again that Mr. <persName>Downey</persName>,
                            Mr. <persName>Fecteau</persName>, and Mr. <persName>Redmond</persName>
                            should have been released 12 years ago, in accordance with <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0613"/>our agreement in September 1955 and
                            urge that, however belatedly, your Government carry out this agreement
                            now.”</item>

                            actions against Peking. You should strongly object to failure to set new
                            meeting date but obviously if Chinese refuse agree we cannot force them
                            to do so. Only precedent for this was at 73rd meeting on December 12,
                            1957, when, as result our decision designate new US representative below
                            Ambassador-level, it was agreed that announcement concerning next
                            meeting would be made subsequently. This led to nine-month gap in
                            meetings. You should, however, reemphasize points now included in paras

                            noted above has been to set firm date for next meeting. You should

                                Vietnamese Party journal, suggests the probability of new friction
                                between Peking and Hanoi. Even if the Vietnamese were severely
                                provoked by some recent Chinese action, this article is still a
                                remarkable affront coming from a small nation so dependent upon
                                Chinese largesse. It is also another index of the low state of

                    <p>The course of the Cultural Revolution has made attempted time tables
                        hazardous. However, it seems to me there are a number of indicators which
                        point to a likely crucial stage within a very few months. It is possible
                        that by September there will have been fairly significant developments. As
                        of now, the fortunes of Maoism continue slowly to sink.</p>

                            apparently 17th anniversary (June 27) of U.S. 7th Fleet separation of
                            Taiwan mainland. He repeated usual charges of U.S. occupation,
                            oppression of people on Taiwan, collusion with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. Emphasized <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would eventually liberate Taiwan
                            and that U.S. sooner or later would be forced withdraw. Later in meeting

                            concrete problems unless U.S. withdraws from Taiwan and Taiwan Straits.

                            with. He raised visits by U.S. officials to Taiwan and <persName corresp="#p_YC1">C.K. Yen</persName> visit to Washington, charging
                            this prep-aratory to new U.S.-GRC moves against mainland. I rebutted

                            intentionally to drag meeting out to [apparent omission] hours. He
                            seemed to lose his temper only at one point, in referring to U.S.
                            expansion of war. He referred to me as “liar” and “gangster” at one
                            point and I responded by rejecting such epithets as unworthy our roles
                            in Warsaw talks. He did not repeat them. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> opening statement such propaganda potboiler I was

                        about to visit Peking. According to a memorandum of the conversation
                        prepared <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0617"/>in the Department of
                        State, <persName>Johnson</persName> told Maurer the United States did not
                        want war with China, did not seek to change China's system of government,
                        had no designs on Chinese territory, and wanted only to trade with China and
                        get along to the extent that China would permit. He stated that he would
                        like to talk to the Chinese about a non-proliferation treaty and to “work
                        out ground rules so that we can avoid nuclear war.” He stated also that it
                        would be “the height of folly” for the United States to want to go to war
                        with China; nothing could be further from his mind. Noting that Maurer was
                        about to visit other countries, <persName>Johnson</persName> stated that he
                        was at liberty to describe their conversation and to quote anything
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> had said, if it would be useful. For text

                    <p>The Embassy in Bucharest reported on July 15 that Maurer had told visiting
                        Austrian Chancellor Josef Klaus that he had found the Chinese preoccupied
                        with the idea the United States was preparing to attack the China mainland
                        and had told them what <persName>Johnson</persName> had said to him, but
                        that they were not convinced. (Telegrams 61 and 62 from Bucharest, both July

                        <item>The economic outlook depends heavily upon the development of the
                            political situation. During the next year or two, assuming a
                            continuation of the present level of political turmoil, the economy
                            seems likely to deteriorate somewhat, though probably not to the point
                            of causing a sharp decline in industrial production, widespread
                            unemployment, or acute food shortages. The weapons programs could be
                            continued, though some stretch out in particular items might be

                            from the scene, there will probably be a period of confused contesting
                            for power during which economic recovery will be neither rapid nor

                    <p>Recalling your interest in having the facts about the U.S. presence on the
                        offshore islands, I took the opportunity while in Taipei to ask <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Art Hummel</persName> to have the Embassy put
                        together an inventory for our reference. The attached letter from Art and
                        its inclosure<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">The letter from <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Bennett</persName>, July 3, is not printed.</note> is the
                        result.</p>
                    <p>To me the striking thing in this report is the extent to which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has committed its effective forces to the
                        offshore islands, including six of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                        fourteen forward-look divisions plus supporting armor and artillery.
                        According to the report this constitutes nearly half of the best ground
                        forces available to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>While in Taipei and at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, I asked
                        the military their assessment of the defensibility of the offshores. The
                        general consensus was that except for one small island held by irregular
                        forces (Wu-ch'iu Hsu), the other large islands would be very difficult and
                        costly for the Communists to take. However, those with whom I spoke
                        acknowledged that the Communists, were they willing to pay the cost, would
                        probably be able to establish air superiority over the islands, thus putting
                        themselves in a position to interdict resupply operations. The garrisons
                        under these circumstances would be unable to hold out indefinitely, the
                        effect on their morale would be severe, and pressures for U.S. military
                        involvement would be very high. On the other hand, there was general
                        agreement that any frontal assault on the islands would be almost
                        prohibitively costly and that in any air battle over the Strait the kill
                        ratio would probably be heavily in favor of the <gloss target="#t_CAF1">CAF</gloss>. There was also general agreement that there is no sign of
                        increased <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> activity in the offshore
                        island area.</p>

                            participation in the defense of the islands. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has actively sought to enliven the interest of
                            individual Americans in and out of government in the islands, especially
                            Kinmen, by encouraging their visits there. Top <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials may hope that these visits together with the
                            present (small-scale) U.S. involvement on the Offshore islands will
                            influence the U.S. to assist in their defense in the event of another
                            Communist attack.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Congressional Resolution of January 1955 authorized the President to
                            use U.S. forces for the defense of Taiwan and the Penghus and for “the
                            securing and protection of such related positions and territories of
                            that area now in friendly hands and the taking of such other measures as
                            he judges to be required or appropriate in assuring the defense of
                            Formosa and the Pescadores.” The Executive view of defense of related
                            positions and territories was outlined in President Eisenhower's message
                            to Congress asking the authority conveyed in the Resolution. Eisenhower
                            said he would act “only in situations which are recognizable as parts
                            of, or definite preliminaries to, an attack against the main positions
                            of Formosa and the Pescadores.”</p>
                        <p>The U.S. intent has since been publicly reaffirmed in high level
                            statements at least seven times during both the Eisenhower and Kennedy
                            Administrations, most notably during the 1958 Kinmen crisis and most
                            recently by President Kennedy in June 1962. In each instance we have
                            made clear that a U.S. defense of the Offshores would depend on our
                            evaluation of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> attack at
                            hand. Of significance, nonetheless, was the public development of the
                            doctrine in the 1958 crisis. Secretary Dulles, with the intensive
                            bombardment of Kinmen two weeks underway, warned Communist China in a
                            statement September 4 that the defense of the two island groups had
                            “increasingly become related to the defense of Taiwan.” President
                            Eisenhower in a radio-TV address a week later was more explicit: “If the
                            present bombardment and harassment of Quemoy should be converted into a
                            major assault, with which the local defenders could not cope, then we
                            would be compelled to face precisely the situation that Congress
                            visualized in 1955.”</p>

                            are <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> supported. The remaining 3,000

                            are the para-military Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps. Thus,

                            supported GRC forces are deployed on the Offshores. Altogether six of

                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s most modernized and combat
                            ready ground forces, are in the Offshores. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s allocation of nearly half of its best ground forces
                            to these islands is perhaps the clearest manifestation of the importance
                            it attaches to the Offshores. The figures in this paragraph are those

                        <p>Contingency U.S. participation in the defense of the two island groups is
                            provided for in Plan Rochester, the comprehensive plan for the joint
                                US–<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> defense of Taiwan and the
                            Penghus pursuant to the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. Taiwan
                            Defense Command first drafted the plan with the Ministry of National
                            Defense in 1955 and together with the Ministry has kept it updated. The
                            current plan's premise for contingency employment of U.S. forces in the
                            defense of the Offshores envisages possible provision of U.S. naval and
                            air forces to supplement those of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> with the objective of gaining air and naval superiority
                            in the Strait. No deployment of U.S. ground forces to the islands is
                            contemplated by the contingency plan, the land defense being left to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ground forces then in place.</p>
                        <p>Officers of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command who are engaged in joint
                            planning find their Chinese counterparts well aware of the conditional
                            nature of the 1955 Congressional Resolution. Many Chinese officers seem
                            convinced, however, that the Presidential determination has <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0622"/>already been made for a number of
                            hypothecated contingencies, and they frequently try to sound out U.S.
                            officers concerning these assumed decisions. Some Chinese military
                            officers also argue that a future contingency would not be materially
                            different from the 1958 crisis, and that the U.S. response would
                            therefore be the same.</p>

                        <p>U.S. economic assistance in the Offshores constitutes a small but still
                            significant part of the current U.S. involvement in the islands. Total
                            direct assistance has amounted over the years to about US$2.3 million,
                            which while comprising only a fractional 0.15% of the total US$1.5
                            billion of U.S. economic aid given the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, is on a per capita basis higher than that for Taiwan
                            proper. Direct U.S. aid for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>67 amounted
                            to about US$133,000, the bulk of which went to Kinmen. Almost half the
                            islands' population is estimated to have been reached by these programs.
                            Assistance now is divided between two projects: first, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>480 agricultural surplus commodities
                            channeled through voluntary agencies, which came to about US$70,000 in
                            the current fiscal year but which is scheduled to be terminated after
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>68; and second, the school lunch
                            program totalling about US$63,000 for the current school year. (Financed

                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> about a year ago began loaning
                            to a small Chinese military reading room on Kinmen a limited quantity of
                            books (about 300), rec-ords, and films along with a tape recorder and
                            projector. Secondly, TOEFEL tests (the English language test required of
                            Chinese students headed for study in the States) have since last year
                            been administered several times a year by a consular officer who visits
                            the islands for this purpose. Only a small number of students have taken
                            the tests there.</p>

                        <p>For a number of years the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has
                            actively encouraged a wide range of Americans, official and unofficial,
                            to visit Kinmen (similar visits to Matsu, to which access is more
                            difficult, are infrequent). The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            probable purpose is to try to enliven U.S. interest in the Offshores and
                            create an identification with them which would strengthen the sense of
                            U.S. commitment to their defense. The Kinmen visits are intended to
                            impress Americans in the short space of a day with the formidable
                            defense works and the economic development program the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has brought into being on Communist
                            China's doorstep. News coverage which frequently follows the visits
                            tends to add to the impression of U.S. identification with the
                            Offshores.</p>

                    <p>During luncheon today Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked the Secretary's opinion about the evolution
                        of events in China. The Secretary replied that we had the impression that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> had not been able
                        to establish the unity he was apparently seeking. The Ambassador replied
                        that he quite agreed. The Secretary then said that he realized this might
                        still present problems on the Soviet side, but that he felt that it would be
                        useful if the two of us could before long exchange views and have
                        discussions about China. He would think that the Soviets would not be too
                        comfortable about this neighbor of theirs with its teeming population and
                        food problems, with the longest common frontier in the world between the two
                        countries, with Chinese development of thermo-nuclear weapons and MRBMs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s attitude seemed to
                        indicate some agreement with these remarks, but he was noncommittal. He
                        commented only that Viet-Nam made impossible meaningful discussions between
                        us on a great many subjects.</p>
                    <p>There then ensued a certain amount of inconclusive discussion of Viet-Nam
                        along familiar lines during which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the United States had not been very
                        helpful to the Soviet Union in this connection and that it was the
                        impression in Moscow that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s trip to Viet-Nam and new proposals for increasing
                        our force strength there followed directly on the termination of the
                        Glassboro talks between the President and Chairman Kosygin.</p>

                        particular group in Peking necessarily extends beyond the handful of cities
                        where so-called power seizures occurred last winter.”<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">Telegram 554 from Hong Kong, July 26. (Department of

                            <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">CHICOM</gloss>)</note> The reported detention
                        of Vice Premier and Minister of Interior Hsieh Fu-chih in Wuhan from where
                        he has just made his dramatic return after the personal intercession of
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>, is the most
                        open defiance yet against central authority.</p>
                    <p>Both the People's Daily and Peking Radio earlier today warned local
                        authorities in Wuhan to surrender or face destruction by the Chinese Army.
                        The interesting thing is that none of our sophisticated intelligence
                        gathering means have given any indication that the Army is planning to do
                        anything of the sort. Wuhan's defiance has gone on long enough now for there
                        to be evidence of planned military action against the city, if the threat to
                        Peking's authority is to be met with force. It is very possible that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> faction is unsure whether the Army would act.</p>
                    <p>This is the first clear test case of serious defiance on the part of top
                        local authorities, prompting a threat of military action by Peking. There
                        are at least seven other Yangtze Valley provinces which will surely watch
                        the outcome of this test. If Peking is unable to bring this situation under
                        control, other local authorities will decide that it is safe to be defiant,
                        and that could mean the beginning of the end for the <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> combine.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, there is a rising tide of reports from all over the country
                        indicating that the disorder is getting worse. One is tempted, in fact, to
                        believe that Peking's indignant listing of Liu Shao-chi's erroneous policies
                        has helped increasing numbers of the populace to realize that they prefer
                        Liu's policies to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s, and are
                        prepared actively to support anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> forces.</p>
                    <p>The battle is by no means over but the downward trend in <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin</persName> fortunes, which I believe has been steady if slow since
                        last summer, has in the past week accelerated markedly.</p>

                        <item>This message discusses the problem of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s maritime incursions, and indicates briefly what they
                            are and what they are not.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The incursions are small-scale. We know of no <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans to mount any large-scale military or paramilitary
                            operations now or in the near future, such operations are unlikely and
                            beyond <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> capabilities. The last
                            incursion of any size was the disastrous one of August 1965 in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> lost two ships near Tungshan
                            Island. Since that time there have been seven known incursions—in rubber
                            rafts, M–5 class fiberglass speedboats, and an outboard-powered
                            catamaran. These have generally comprised 6–10 people, the largest being
                            a team of about 15 men in two speedboats used in the Shuntung raid on 29
                            May 1967.</item>

                            direction and coordination of these incursions. These incursions are
                            often run without the coordination or foreknowledge of other <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> offices. There have even been cases

                            between the traditional <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interest in
                            “back to the mainland, “and the recent general <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> emphasis on political actions. Recently, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been attempting to make NSB and J/E

                        <item>We know that there is a slightly heightened high-level <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military interest of late in continuing

                            continue. We estimate that they will continue to use the available types
                            of boats in incursion attempts. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will have two midget submarines, each capable of

                        <item>Such incursions are in part understandable not in empirical result,
                            but because they are one of the few avenues of independent capability

                            the military balance is constantly shifting, to the disadvantage of

                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>It is clear that China aspires to great power status and that its
                            present leaders have given high priority to developing a substantial
                            strategic capability as essential to such status. With wise management
                            of their limited resources, the Chinese could continue to make steady
                            progress toward the achievement of these goals over the next
                            decade.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The probable extent of actual progress will remain in doubt, however,
                            so long as fanaticism and disorder continue to infect China. Some
                            adverse effects on the advanced weapons program are probable in any
                            event; serious disruptions could result from pressures to do too much
                            too soon or from a general breakdown in central authority.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>China probably now has a few fission weapons in stockpile deliverable
                            by bomber, and has demonstrated the capability to produce thermonuclear
                            weapons with megaton (mt) yields. It will soon have the plutonium
                            available to aid in reducing such weapons to missile warhead size as
                            well as to facilitate the development of more compact, light weight
                            fission devices. For the next year or two, the limited availability of
                            fissionable material will place significant restraints on warhead
                            production, but this will ease significantly in the following years as
                            the Yumen plutonium production reactor reaches full output.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>We believe that limited deployment of an <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> with fission warheads is likely to begin in the next
                            six months or so. After 1968 when increasing numbers of warheads could
                            be made available, deployment will probably proceed at a higher rate.
                            This deployment would be designed to threaten US bases, and major cities
                            from Japan through the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and northern
                            India.</item>

                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>We estimate that the Chinese can have an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system ready for deployment in the early 1970's.
                            Conceivably, it could be ready as early as 1970–1971. But this would be
                            a tight schedule, and should the Chinese encounter major problems, the
                            IOC would be later. In any event, we will almost certainly detect
                            extended range firings once they begin, and monitoring of these tests
                            will probably provide about one year's advance warning of IOC.</item>
                        <label>F.</label>
                        <item>We have no basis at this time for estimating how far or how fast the
                            Chinese will carry deployment of their first-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Assuming political and economic

                            probably be at least 1970 before additional missile launching submarines
                            could be available. China has shown some interest in nuclear propulsion
                            technology, but even if design on a nuclear submarine is already
                            underway, the first unit probably could not be operational until the

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Ford</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>] reported that the current mood of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leadership is one of pessimism growing out
                        of frustration. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> prediction of a
                        divided leadership on the mainland has come true—by chance—and the US is not
                        interested in taking advantage of it. The uncertainty of status within the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is continual. Communist China's
                        nuclear power is growing and the Gimo feels strongly that the Communists
                        intend using it against Taiwan. Because of the Vietnam war, the US is paying
                        less attention to the defense of the Taiwan Strait. Yet the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has no alternative to the US for
                        support.</p>
                    <p>While the fact of dependence on the US is accepted by the Gimo and other
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders, the resultant pessimistic
                        and somewhat resentful atmosphere is not an easy one in which to work. The
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] is effectively closed out of planning for maritime
                        excursions and agent operations against the mainland. Nevertheless,
                        knowledge of these activities comes to the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>] through a number of
                        sources.</p>
                    <p>The fact that unilateral <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> collection
                        against the mainland is ineffective makes the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> dependent [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>]. A number of highly sophisticated operations
                        are being carried on with full <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        cooperation. At the same time, however, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> shows its independence whenever it can. Recent operations
                        in cooperation with Koreans, renewed interest in the Yunnan border areas,
                        and intelligence liaison with the South Vietnamese are illustrations of this
                        attempt to assert independence.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s question concerning Taiwanese
                        nationalist sentiment, Mr. <persName>Ford</persName> characterized Taiwanese
                        nationalism as insignificant <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0630"/>politically because there is no organized movement—nor is there likely to
                        be, because of close <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> surveillance of
                        prospective leaders. Mr. <persName>Ford</persName> characterized <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> control methods as an astute combination of
                        force and shrewd political moves.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Stuart</persName> asked Mr. <persName>Ford</persName> if, in
                        view of difficulties with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> over
                        phasing out of a joint collection operation last year, he could forecast how
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would react to withdrawal of an
                        additional project in which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> played
                        the major role. Mr. <persName>Ford</persName> said that he would regard the
                        closing down of an additional operation as politically unwise and a threat
                        to some of the more sophisticated—and more useful—joint operations unless
                        the withdrawn project were to be replaced immediately by another in which
                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would participate actively. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> otherwise would seize upon the
                        withdrawal as an indication of a change in US policy toward Taiwan, and
                        probably as a move in the direction of coming to terms with Communist
                        China.</p>

                        more autonomous way. However, he does not expect the relapse of the country
                        into the warlord system of the 1920's because: <list>
                            <item>—The regional military commanders are not, generally speaking,
                                local figures, but men with a strong sense of the army as a national
                                institution.</item>

                            <item>—China's modern military is dependent for its existence on the
                                national industrial sector, and the continued flow of material
                                requires each regional commander to recognize interdependence with

                    </list>
                    <p>1. On April 6, 1967 you spoke to the President about the licensing of certain
                        pharmaceuticals and related medical equipment to Communist China for use in
                        the treatment or prevention of spinal meningitis, cholera, and infectious
                        hepatitis, diseases that were in or threatening to reach epidemic stage in
                        mainland China at the time. The President authorized the licensing of these
                        items but only for the duration of the epidemics.</p>
                    <p>2. Our information is that these diseases have run their course as epidemics.
                        However, no American firm was ever approached by the Chinese Communists for
                        the sale of any drugs during the period of the epidemics. I believe a
                        publicized action to rescind the move to permit licensing would be viewed by
                        an articulate segment of the American public as a step backward and contrary
                        to the President's stated policy of concern for the people of mainland
                        China. I believe, therefore, that no public statement and no approach to
                        American pharmaceutical firms should be made at this time but rather, in the
                        unlikely event that an American firm should receive a request from the
                        Chinese Communists,<pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0632"/> we act on each
                        request in the context of the general situation obtaining at the time.</p>

                        this matter have run their course and recommend that, despite this fact, we
                        take no action to announce the termination of the temporary relaxation of
                        our embargo on trade with China to permit the licensing of drugs and medical
                        equipment useful in treating or preventing those epidemics and will, as a
                        practical matter, deal with cases, if they arise, on their merits.<note n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">

                            <item>—the Cultural Revolution has been pushed in ways which generate

                            <item>—the opposition lacks the structure which might make it
                                susceptible to identification, attack and destruction;</item>
                            <item>—prominent Maoists in Peking are primarily propagandists and

                    <p>1052. 1. Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                            Ching-kuo</persName> called on me Oct 11 at his request. His principal
                        theme was that thorough <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> exchange of views on mainland situation
                        particularly necessary now because of recent changes there.</p>
                    <p>2. After brief analysis current <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        attempts to restore order, <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> stated that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> may regain control for short
                        period but this would not last. Minister said he anticipated long term
                        struggle. He believed Communist regime now in greater difficulty than ever
                        in past. He said <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> should look problem
                        squarely in eye and try to see how enemy could be weakened.</p>
                    <p>3. Minister said he felt US and <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> should
                        have even closer contact and share each other's thinking more completely.
                        Specifically he said <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are greatest
                        enemy and greatest threat to both US and <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>. This gives both countries a basic common interest. He stressed
                        that <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> believes political action against
                        mainland is most important, as President <persName>Chiang</persName> made
                        clear in his Double Ten speech. He termed this speech as significant
                        statement of current <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policy and
                        thinking. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said that within framework of
                        not taking military action, US and <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>
                        should see how best to stir up changes on mainland and unrest in Communist
                        armed forces which might accelerate collapse of regime. Minister said he <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0634"/>felt political warfare and other
                        possible steps “not so much military as political actions and in fact
                        primarily political actions” were required. He said he had no specific
                        proposals to offer now, but we both should look into it. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> added that if we allow things to remain as
                        they are, <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> will have short
                        periods of stability and will be able to increase his power. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> then reiterated hope both sides could look
                        into possibilities offered by political warfare. Later <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> added once again, that in undertaking any
                        political warfare actions against mainland, <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> principle was to assume responsibility and not involve US
                        in the political struggle against the Chinese Communists.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not satisfied with its current inadequate information on
                        mainland events. <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> realizes there many
                        more significant changes occurring than those of which it aware. <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> must secure more information before being
                        able to obtain complete understanding of conditions on mainland. Therefore,
                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said, <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> wishes to pay great attention to improved cooperation with
                        us in the intelligence sphere so that we can unite and make effective our
                        efforts. He recognized that additional efforts were called for on <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>'s part. He said <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> had not undertaken any major intelligence operations on the
                        mainland and it wishes to consult with us before it takes any such
                        operations. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> reiterated his hope that we
                        could continue our efforts to obtain more information.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> told me that <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> hoped to join up with some anti-Maoist elements on mainland
                        to increase ROC's effectiveness. He noted that Chinese were traditionally
                        anti-Soviet but that Chinese people in general were favorably disposed to us
                        and that this factor should be exploited and use made of it with anti-Maoist
                        elements which were also anti-Russian.</p>
                    <p>6. I concurred that both our countries should pay even closer attention to
                        mainland developments. Said I would report Minister's conversation and
                        suggested another meeting be held when Washington's reply received. I put in
                        caveat that while I felt joint US–<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        analysis of political situation on mainland extremely important, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position was that any actions which would
                        needlessly be provocative towards Communist China should be avoided. US
                        wanted to prevent escalation war in Vietnam. Therefore avoidance provocation
                        towards <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s was important factor in
                        US policy considerations. On other hand if war in Vietnam were to expand
                        through direct <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> intervention then
                        new situation would be created which would require full assessment. But as
                        long as Communist China did not intervene massively and overtly, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position and attitude of US people would
                        not agree to any action on mainland which looked like adventurism.</p>
                    <p>7. Minister replied that he fully understood this position and this was why
                        he had stressed avoidance of any US military actions and he <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0635"/>said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        guiding principle was not to contradict US policy. He added that his
                        statements were of course only preliminary at this stage.</p>

                            His conversation with you as reported Refs A and C suggest that he may
                            be seeking some expression of US support for an expanded <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> program of “political warfare” action
                            on mainland, including sabotage, guerrilla drops and clandestine
                            political activities. He also may wish to involve us in joint planning
                            of such activity. Should he make such purpose clear, it would be
                            necessary specifically to inform <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>

                    <p>64101. 1. Italian Chargé Terruzzi called on Under Secretary
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> today to request US support for Italian
                        initiative to sponsor study committee <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0637"/>resolution on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>.
                        Although he said he was acting on Fanfani's instruction, Terruzzi was quite
                        fuzzy as to whether Italians were consulting us about wisdom of such move or
                        informing us of decision already made.</p>
                    <p>2. After indicating Italy would again oppose Albanian resolution and possibly
                        co-sponsor Important Question resolution Terruzzi explained Italian desire
                        to “do something more” and their wish to obtain our support for submission
                        of study committee resolution which would link <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> problem to question of universality of membership. In
                        response <persName>Rostow</persName>'s question Terruzzi added, after search
                        of his instructions, that he thought Italian Government had already decided
                        to go ahead but was still most interested in US reaction.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName>Rostow</persName> commented that while we publicly supported
                        study committee resolution last year and still recognized potential utility
                        of this approach, we believed it would be a mistake to submit resolution
                        this year. Our soundings showed that most countries hoped <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> debate would be as routine as
                        possible primarily because of conditions on China mainland. Also clear that
                        study committee resolution would be overwhelmingly defeated, possibly by
                        even larger margin than last year. Thus we failed to see advantage of
                        advancing resolution at this time and saw no point to jeopardizing future
                        utility of study committee concept by subjecting it to sure defeat for
                        second year.</p>
                    <p>4. Terruzzi argued study committee might be useful as way to test <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> attitude—i.e. were Chinese prepared
                        to accept certain conditions which might be formulated and presented to
                        them? <persName>Rostow</persName> noted there would be no testing of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in this fashion if resolution were
                        not adopted, which we sure would be the case.</p>
                    <p>5. When asked what US would do if Italians proceeded to table study committee
                        resolution, <persName>Rostow</persName> said matter had not been decided and
                        would have to be considered by President. He personally assumed that in view
                        of our unchanged underlying support we would probably vote in favor. He
                        cautioned, however, that he did not wish to deal with this question at this
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>6. Since Chargé did not seem grasp point <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        concluded conversation by explicitly asking Terruzzi to convey following
                        response to Rome: Our judgment is that it would be mistake for Italians to
                        undertake <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> initiative this year
                        because we considered it politically inopportune in light of Assembly
                        attitudes, conditions in China, and certainty that resolution would be badly
                        defeated. Second and overwhelming defeat of this measure would be unhelpful
                        to our interests since study committee resolution could prove feasible and
                        desirable at later time. If Italian Government were to insist on pursuing
                        matter, we would of course give it further careful consideration.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> added, however, <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0638"/>that he was quite certain that we would not be in position
                        to co-sponsor such resolution.</p>
                    <p>7. Terruzzi left informal translation of illustrative resolution (see SepTel)
                        which Italians have in mind.</p>
                    <p>8. Comment: Although we believe Belgians and some other co-sponsors of
                        Italian initiative last year are cool to reintroduction this year, we are by
                        no means certain we will be able to head off Italians at this late stage.
                        Moreover, Chileans have never dropped idea and may well conclude that
                        Italian position is sufficient to justify their precipitating issue.</p>
                    <p>9. Embassy Rome requested to ensure that <persName>Rostow</persName>'s
                        comments accurately conveyed to Fanfani.</p>
                    <p>Embassies Santiago and Brussels requested to bring US reaction to attention
                        of Chilean and Belgian Governments so that there no misunderstanding of our

                            my request as follow-up to our conversation of Oct 11, with special view
                            to further exploration of his views of “political warfare” against
                            mainland, in light of Ref A. I was accompanied by DCM <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                        <item>I said that within the framework, which he understood, of avoiding
                            provocative actions against the mainland, Washington had given a <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0639"/>basically affirmative response
                            to his suggestions of Oct 11, and that we did want to improve our joint
                            intelligence collection and analysis. I spoke of the opportunities for
                            identifying potential defectors and agents, and for building channels to
                            them. I reminded him that a team of US intelligence specialists would be
                            arriving from Washington next month to discuss mainland conditions (Ref
                            B) and said that we wanted to expand our exchange of information with

                            intelligence cooperation and analysis. I said we were not certain just
                            what <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> had meant by intensified
                            political warfare operations. If he was thinking of getting in touch
                            with anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> elements, I said,
                            then we were favorably disposed toward consideration of such efforts,
                            but we would have to be mindful of the need to avoid provocations and
                            offensive actions.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> replied that as he had said in our
                            previous conversation of Oct 11, he wanted to intensify joint US–GRC
                            efforts directed at the mainland, and wanted to adhere to the principle
                            of close exchange of info. He had not yet considered what specific
                            actions should be taken, but he meant by political warfare (1) to do
                            what can be done to impede <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                            efforts to form internal “alliances” that include dissident elements,
                            and (2) to make efforts to see that the internal struggles on the
                            mainland do not stop. He said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            wanted to get into contact with elements that are anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and with those that have failed to
                            make accommodations to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                            policies. He said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been in
                            contact with some of these elements in deep interior areas far from
                            Taiwan where little could be done to assist them. What is now needed, he
                            said, is contact with new elements nearer the coast, and when these
                            contacts are achieved he would be talking with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> about what to do.</item>

                            I mentioned influential elements in several areas (Sinkiang, Tibet,

                        <item>It seems to me that <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> in raising
                            this subject last month was following instructions, probably from the
                            Gimo, to sound us out in general terms without making any specific
                            proposals for action at this time. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>'s
                            rather general response to further probing has narrowed the field of
                            subject matter apparently to exclude sabotage and the dropping of large
                            action teams. What he apparently wanted was a general expression of
                            interest, or at least lack of discouragement, from the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on the subject of making contact with
                            dissident elements on the mainland for essentially political purposes.
                            He now has had this expression of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            interest, hedged with appropriate caveats about avoiding provocative
                            actions. He seems not to want to go further in detailed discussions at
                            this time, and I do not think we should press him.</item>

                            <item>The study attempts to gear our presumed inflexible rectitude to a
                                supposedly safe mechanical automaticity. It is dangerous to do that
                                in this matter, for it prejudices “for all time” judgment as to the

                            <item>The United States' position on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> has changed already with changing circumstances,
                                and the time could come when it should change again. For years we
                                simply opposed Chinese Communist entry, and that was that. More
                                recently we have left our policy open-ended. We insist that the
                                position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> be maintained,
                                but we are (or were last year) silent on some other implications.
                                Furthermore, we are on record now as having favored a study group,
                                and if the question arises again this year we may have trouble
                                voting against the resolution—although we wish the issue would not
                                come up.</item>

                            <item>I think we have placed things about right. This issue is too
                                important for us to lose our flexibility on it. We may be faced with
                                a markedly different situation next year.</item>

                            <item>I do not think we should show any “forward movement” on <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> this year. Last year, up
                                until fall, a fairly good case could be made for cautious forward
                                movement, provided we still supported the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s position. Communist China was certainly no rose
                                even then, but since the 1959 excesses of the Great Leap, creeping
                                revisionism had brought from 1961 visions of a maturing of the
                                Revolution on a vaguely Soviet pattern. That still does not produce
                                a rose, but Brezhnevism is better than Stalinism. Last year there
                                was increasing discomfort at ponderous China's being unarticulated
                                with the world. A case could be made up to last summer for
                                attempting to further Peking's processes of inching toward
                                reasonableness in internal policies by hinting at alternatives
                                externally—in the hopes that external policies too might “mature.”
                                This especially made sense when it appeared that an alternative road
                                could be dangled at Peking in a serious and instructive yet academic
                                experiment—academic because we could almost certainly test reactions
                                while ensuring that the political outcome of the problem would not
                                be altered for at least a year or so. The following year, if we
                                should want the practical outcome still not to be changed, this
                                would doubtless be for reasons (primarily trends in the nature of
                                the regime) which would strike others similarly, and we would not be
                                taking an unreasonable calculated risk. (After all, in extremis, we
                                could have our way with the veto.)</item>

                                helped crystalize China's deep policy problems and differences,
                                contributing to an indeterminate but real degree to hastening and
                                exacerbating the troubles associated with the Cultural

                                virtual dissolution not completely unthinkable! Taking steps to
                                further the maturation of the Revolution only makes sense when its
                                maturation is proceeding along revisionist lines.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and Ambassador in rather
                            discursive presentation explained <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            did not like being put in situation where trouble came from its friends
                            rather than its enemies. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had been
                            working this year, particularly among Latin Americans, to reduce
                            potential support for study committee resolution and, partly as result
                            of US efforts to dissuade Italian and Chilean initiatives, had been able
                            to shift number of Latin Americans to opposition. US decision to vote
                            for resolution would undercut <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            efforts. Greatest problem, however, was how <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could explain US vote in Taiwan. US vote last year had
                            caused serious difficulties but <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had
                            been able to weather crisis on understanding that US vote was tactic
                            adopted out of necessity whereas situation this year clearly did not
                            require study committee. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> recognized
                            negative US vote might jeopardize Italian votes on Important Question
                            and Albanian resolutions but did not believe this too important.</item>

                        <item>Secretary commented that Italians had reached their decision after big
                            controversy in Cabinet. Nenni had used his role in political coalition
                            so that he was in essence conditioning his support of Italian position
                            vis-a-vis Important Question and Albanian resolutions to re-submission
                            of study committee proposal. Originally Italians had in mind far worse
                            text which we had indicated we would have to vote against. Even though
                            US position had to take into account problems of several “soft sisters”
                            on this question (Italy, Chile and others) <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should be able to relax because it could be certain
                            that study committee resolution would not be adopted by Assembly. After
                            reminding <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> that Taipei
                            ultimately seemed quite satisfied with outcome of last year's <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> debate, Secretary emphasized that
                            we should concentrate on main issues which were to maximize our support
                            for <gloss target="#t_IQ1">IQ</gloss> resolution and against Albanian
                            resolution; study committee issue was sideshow which <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could brush off.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> reiterated that US vote in
                            favor of study committee could not be explained adequately to President
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            and that it would create doubt among people because concept clearly
                            implied two Chinas. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> added that
                            he couldn't understand why Italians and others persisted in this
                            approach when it was so obvious that two-Chinas arrangements were
                            completely unacceptable to Chinese. Given the lack of necessity this
                            year, <persName corresp="#p_WT1">Wei</persName> urged US reverse its
                            position and vote against Italian resolution.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Secretary stated that US could not be so casual about reversing
                            decision. Since study committee device did not appear necessary this
                            year, US had tried strenuously to dissuade Italians from pursuing
                            matter, but once sponsors decide to go ahead we had to keep in mind our
                            future position when we might very well need study committee to hold
                            line <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0644"/>against Albanian
                            resolution. Moreover, US had other problems to be considered. Nenni, for
                            example, could create grave difficulties if he were to throw Italian
                            Government into real crisis, and there were similar problems in other
                            countries.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Referring to a previous conversation in which Secretary had cautioned
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not to see ghosts where there
                            were none, <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> stressed that he
                            wanted to avoid another crisis of confidence between US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. It was possible overcome crisis last
                            year because <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> recognized US had moved
                            under duress; this was not the case this year and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> found US support for study committee
                            incomprehensible.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Secretary said that while <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            and Ambassador could feel free to tell Gimo they had pressed us very
                            hard, he urged that they not push him too far on this matter. He said he
                            would give thought to their request and would, of course, be most
                            pleased if the Italians were at last minute to stop short of tabling
                            resolution. However, while US understood <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s position, we had broad and long-range considerations
                            to keep in mind not only in terms of our relations with certain other
                            countries but possible future need for device of study committee which
                            might develop in later Assemblies. In any case, US support of study
                            committee would be passive and we would not seek to influence votes of
                            others.</item>

                            saying they feared Italians would deliberately misconstrue US position
                            and thus counteract <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> campaign against
                            study committee. Secretary assured them US certainly would do nothing to

                    <p>The voting closely paralleled our earlier estimates. However, a notable
                        defection on the Albanian resolution was Ecuador, which shifted from no to
                        an abstention. Saudi Arabia, which was expected to vote no, was absent, but
                        we gained a no vote from Cameroon, which had abstained in 1966.</p>
                    <p>A motion by Australia to give priority in the voting to the Important
                        Question resolution was adopted 67–41 with 12 abstentions. A separate move
                        by Syria to require a two-thirds majority on the Study Committee proposal
                        was adopted 36–31 (US) with 53 abstentions. This vote was substantially
                        different from last year (51–37–30) because some countries, such as the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and East Europeans, shifted from
                        yes to abstain. The rollcall vote this year perhaps made it more difficult

                            accurate. Even if President <persName>Chiang</persName> and top Chinese
                            officials feel this goal is not presently achievable, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believes it must maintain claim to be
                            government of all China and keep alive, at least publicly, its goal of
                            mainland recovery, in order to justify its rule on Taiwan and protect
                            its legitimacy. Consequently, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            pronouncements about mainland recovery are still relatively frequent,
                            even though major emphasis is now on political rather than military
                            action to achieve this end. Latest statement in mainland recovery was
                            made by Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>) Nov 27 in
                            Tokyo. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said he believed that “in the

                            regime.” Such statements disturb and concern Japanese, ourselves and
                            other governments. On the other hand, this concern should be tempered by
                            fact that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been making similar
                            and sometimes even more militant statements intermittently for the past

                            intervention). Although President <persName>Chiang</persName> and some

                            restoration of order on mainland, we believe it highly unlikely that

                            intelligence forays along Yunnan border areas. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> motive in continuing small scale incursions is not only
                            for intelligence gain but more importantly (since most of previous
                            attempts have been unsuccessful) for internal psychological purposes—to
                            demonstrate they are showing the flag and to prove they are continuing
                            offensive against enemy. This determination to show the flag in the
                            mainland may continue to cause some anxiety in Tokyo and other capitals,
                            which may not be fully informed about actual <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intentions and motivations, and may judge import of

                            more ambitious and potentially dangerous than they actually are. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>, for example, reportedly started at
                            Tokyo press conference Nov 29 that guerrilla raids against mainland
                            would be increased. In recent <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            statements it has been implicit that anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> forces on mainland (not forces sent from Taiwan)
                            were carrying out guerrilla activity. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>'s statement reported in local press leaves source of
                            guerrilla raids deliberately vague. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>,
                            as part of its psychological warfare effort, may continue to take credit
                            for anti-Maoist activities on mainland, even though <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> lacks real control over reported

                            this type of propaganda is very limited because these statements stem

                            of US “disengagement”, we believe it unlikely that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would respond to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut by deliberately staging provocative

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>) came to my residence yesterday (Dec 4)
                            at his own request to brief me on his recent trip to Japan (reported
                                <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>), I took opportunity to
                            prepare him for prospective substantial <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut and to suggest possibility of reducing size of
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ground forces as one means of
                            reducing military expenditures.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I reminded <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> that I and US military
                            representatives here had already told him of probable sizeable reduction
                            in map funds for the current fiscal year. I said that while the final
                            appropriation has not yet been passed, it now appeared highly likely
                            that the world-wide map program would be significantly reduced. I said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have to take its
                            essentially proportionate share of a rather drastic reduction along with
                            most other recipients. It appeared that military assistance to Korea and
                            Thailand, for compelling reasons, would not be affected as much as the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. I told him that <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss> VAdm <persName corresp="#p_CVAJL1">Chew</persName> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief MGen Cicolella had been for some time discussing
                            with me ways to cushion the adverse effects and offset part of the
                            program losses that seemed almost certain. I hoped that Gen Cicolella's
                            constructive ideas for economies and greater combat efficiency within
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military establishment would
                            help, and I thought his suggestions for enabling the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed forces to earn revenues for
                            military purchases by rebuilding and overhauling US combat equipment
                            used in Vietnam might also hold considerable promise. I said we all
                            hoped that the reduction would be instituted for a single year only, but
                            we could not be sure of this, because once Congress makes deep cuts it
                            is possible they will be inclined to follow the newly established level
                            as a precedent in future years. I emphasized that the impending cut did
                            not represent any change in US policy, and that the defense needs of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were well appreciated in
                            Washington and at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. I pointed
                            out that the cutbacks of major investment items including F–5 aircraft
                            would not be felt for two years or more because the procurement pipeline
                            was very long. If the cuts are not restored in future years, I said,
                            there could eventually be a heavy adverse impact in the essential
                            categories of modern weapons unless we plan carefully, <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0651"/>and coordinate closely to make the best
                            use of the resources that are available. I said there would of course be
                            an immediate impact on operating funds. I knew that his officers had
                            been in close contact with Gen Cicolella, and I believed that I had kept
                            Washington well informed of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            needs and of the effects of the proposed reductions.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said that any deep cuts would be a
                            very serious and important matter to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. He intended for his senior <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and service officers to keep in close touch with Gen
                            Cicolella on this problem. He said that as a matter of policy it was
                            necessary to keep up the combat effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces at a time when <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> military effectiveness is increasing steadily. He
                            asked that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> pay close attention to
                            the pressing need for implementation of this basic policy.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>
                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> observed that in past years the
                            significance, although not the magnitude, of military assistance to
                            Korea and to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been very
                            similar since the role of the two countries as vital parts of the system
                            of deterrence of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggression
                            was comparable. He said that although he realized Korea was making a
                            troop contribution in Vietnam he hoped that “in principle” <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Korea and for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be considered together, although
                            the amounts furnished the two countries would of course differ. I said I
                            understood his point and I would make sure that Washington understood
                            also.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>I then said that the question has been raised as to whether the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should not consider reducing its ground
                            forces, while at same time upgrading their effectiveness and firepower.
                            I asked for his reaction to this thought, which might have effect of
                            saving needed funds during a period of stringency resulting from <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> reduction.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>
                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> paused, considering his reply and
                            said carefully that it would of course be necessary to confer closely
                            with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> about the best means of
                            maintaining the combat effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces. However, he said, “any reduction in the size of
                            our ground forces is something we cannot consider (pu neng k'ao lu).” He
                            said any such move would be essentially a political one, with grave
                            political repercussions. He pointed out that while the reduction in
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> would have some adverse impact
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, if it did not affect the
                            status of capability of the armed forces, it would not be misunderstood
                            by “the average person” on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as
                            signifying any change in basic US-China policy, especially since it was
                            a Congressional rather than an administration action, and would be of
                            general and impartial worldwide application. On the other hand, any
                            reduction of the force levels in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            would lead people to think there had been a change in policy,
                            attributable to US action and affecting the security of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Anyway, he said, reducing the ground
                            forces would not result in much saving. He said he realized and
                            understood the difficulties the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                            having with <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, but that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> also has its difficulties. Any
                            reduction of forces would have misleading implications and <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0652"/>would also have a bad effect on morale
                            of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces. Even raising the subject
                            for general discussion would have adverse repercussions. Since any
                            saving would be small, and the repercussions great, it would be very
                            much better not to pursue this proposal at all. He again said he would
                            discuss carefully with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> the best
                            means of maintaining and improving the combat effectiveness of existing
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces with available
                            resources.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I observed that we on the US side all hope that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> can ensure that the impending <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut will not have an adverse effect on
                            the economic development of the country. We are deeply impressed with
                            the remarkable progress made in the economic field in Taiwan, and we
                            earnestly hope that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> can avoid
                            any diversion of resources from economic development to defense that
                            would impede economic growth. I realized it would not be easy to meet
                            essential requirements in both sectors, but it was important that a
                            major effort be made to do so, and we hoped we could help.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> replied that he understood my point
                            very well. He wanted to state that what he had said earlier was put
                            forward in the light not only of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            interests but also the security interests of the US. He said that
                            approaches other than reduction of forces would have to be found. He
                            said he and his government believed that us problems are also those of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and those of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are also US problems. We would consult
                            closely in seeking solutions. We felt that basically money is a
                            secondary factor, the most important element being the underlying spirit
                            and attitude of the cooperating countries.</item>

                            long been considered by <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> as

                            “rebellion”, designed to weaken it in the face of the Communist threat.
                            Practically speaking, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> probably
                            estimates that without strict security controls a mainlander government

                        <item>Police sweeps of various types are a periodic exercise on Taiwan. For
                            example, prior to Chinese New Year's there are local sweeps directed
                            against petty criminals. A more general sweep is also an annual
                            occurrence. Such a sweep was conducted June 8, 1965. On May 14 and 18,
                            1966, there were two sweeps in anticipation of
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s inauguration for fourth term. This
                            fall there seems to have been two sweeps: a small one in late August
                            directed at Taiwanese independence advocates or their associates, and a
                            general sweep on October 5, timed to catch potential security risks by
                            double ten.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Only the pattern for the general police sweep seems at all
                            established. Reportedly, the garrison command sets a quota of persons to
                            be picked up for each municipality or county and mobilizes all available
                            regular military police, and special security forces. Curfew is put in
                            effect about 1:00 a.m. on an unannounced day, and no one except police
                            is allowed to move until 6:00 a.m. Trains are stopped at their nearest
                            station. During this period everyone, at home or in public places, has
                            his household registration and identity card checked for irregularities
                            and against lists of wanted criminals. In this year's general sweep, the
                            press reported the next day that about 100 were arrested in Taipei.
                            According to one Embassy source in the garrison command, 80 out of the
                            100 detained in Taipei in October were picked up from the wanted list of
                            habitual bad check passers. Only part of the remaining 20 (a “handful”
                            according to garrison command source) were detained as “threats to
                            social stability”. The exact number detained in the two sweeps late this
                            year is unknown: 230 is the largest island-wide estimate the Embassy has
                            heard. Presumably this excludes temporary detention.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>One reason that the exact number detained in such sweeps is not
                            particularly significant is that certain police subdivisions, finding it
                            hard to meet their assigned detention quotas, apparently detain a few of
                            the local social misfits (petty racketeers, vagrants, etc.) for a few
                            days just to fill out their list. The percentage of Taiwanese detained
                            in this year's sweeps is not accurately known. The Embassy has, however,
                            heard complaints from Taiwanese in the past that police sweeps pick up
                            an even larger percentage of Taiwanese than their proportion in the
                            general population would make likely.</item>

                        <item>Martial law on Taiwan is justified by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as necessary consequence of existence of a state of
                            hostilities with the Chinese Communists. It covers a wide variety of
                            threats to public safety and public order. Any <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0654"/>case considered to involve either
                            rebellion or sedition would fall under its provisions. Article 5 of the
                            rules regarding the punishing of rebellion and sedition provides for ten
                            years to life imprisonment for “participation in a rebel organization or
                            meeting.” Article 6 provides for 7 years to life for “spreading a rumor
                            or disseminating untrue information which might endanger public peace or
                            order or disturb the mind of the people”. Article 7 provides 7 years to
                            life imprisonment for a person who “uses written articles, pictures,
                            books or speeches for publicity purposes for the benefit of a rebellious
                            organization.” Article 4 provides for the death penalty, life or
                            imprisonment for not less than ten years for a series of actions such as
                            sabotage, espionage, etc., but also including the “collecting of funds
                            or supplies for or furnishing money or properties to a rebel”,
                            “providing protection to or hiding a rebel”, “ instigating a labor,
                            student or market strike or disturbing public peace and order … under
                            the instruction or for the benefit of a rebel”.</item>

                        <item>Despite stringent nature of law, very few of those picked up in this
                            year's sweeps are likely to be tried under its provisions. For example,
                            those passing bad checks probably were forced to pay up or their family
                            made to provide guarantees for release. To Embassy's knowledge, there
                            have been no trials or political grounds of any of the persons picked up
                            during either August or October sweeps; but under martial law, trial
                            need not be public.</item>

                        <item>Embassy strongly doubts that large number of Taiwanese active in
                            independence movement or other anti-<gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            activities were picked up during August and October police sweeps. Story
                            of sweeps has been common topic of discussion among U.S. students
                            studying here and among Taipei correspondents. It has also been heard in
                            Hong Kong and in Tokyo, where it has been covered in Taiwanese
                            independence movement periodicals. However, only seven names have come
                            to attention of Embassy from all these sources as persons who may have
                            been arrested on political grounds and two of these names appear to
                            refer to same person. As a result, Embassy is inclined to believe that
                            only a handful of those arrested in general sweep were arrested on
                            political grounds.</item>

                        <item>Taiwan's security system is closely related to maintenance of minority
                            government rule over Taiwanese population, ramifications of this issue
                            are very great, and totally beyond purview of <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss> or any other Ministry. Long established U.S. policy of
                            encouraging broader Taiwanese participation in government has produced
                            little effect, since policy is established by top leadership which
                            firmly believes strong centralized control is absolutely essential,
                            especially during period of national emergency. If United States
                            representations were to be made on this subject, they would have to be
                            made to President <persName>Chiang</persName> himself. What we know as
                            to recent sweeps would not justify any demarche to him based on conduct
                            of those sweeps.</item>

                        <item>Case of Kuo Hsi-lin, recent deportee from Japan, appears to be one
                            that would give Japanese some opportunity to make representations if
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> should feel warranted. Iijima,
                            First Secretary Japanese Embassy, called on Embassy Taipei on Dec. 12 to
                            ask what U.S. knows of Kuo's probable future. Stated that Japanese
                            immigration service was given assurances Kuo would not be tried for
                            political crimes and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Embassy
                            Tokyo also gave Kuo a written statement to that effect. Kuo case could
                            easily fall under martial law as interpreted here. In such an event,
                            prosecution of his case would probably follow lines of Huang Chi-ming
                            case. (A–193<note n="3" xml:id="d291fn3">Airgram A–193 from Taipei,
                                September 13. (Ibid.)</note> and previous.) Exit from and entry into
                            Taiwan are responsiblity of a department of the garrison command. (There
                            is no separate immigration service.) Violation of immigration laws might
                            be treated as security offense. Even without such a decision, if maximum
                            penalties sought for all laws broken by Kuo in his illegal entry into
                            and exit from Taiwan, sentence could probably be as severe as if
                            membership in Taiwanese independence movement were charged.</item>

                        grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> prospects.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> noted agreement <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0656"/>of House/Senate conferees December 13 setting overall grant
                        military assistance total at $400 million ($220 million below Administration
                        request), and commented that, given relative fixity other <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs, this figure will mean major
                        reduction in grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. He also observed that in view overall
                        Congressional climate on spending, it probably will be difficult to avoid
                        similar lower grant levels in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> noted, however, that Congressional action on
                        military sales would not have significant impact this year on possibility
                        such sales to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName> indicated understanding of
                        situation and special considerations involved in Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, but expressed hope that reduction in grant
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would not be proportionately larger than cut in overall

                        Referring again to difficulty of making substantial reduction in a number of

                        37 percent reduction in Administration's original request. He acknowledged
                        that Greek situation might release some funds, but stated that amount not

                        these hard facts of life. He noted our concern to maintain <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> defense capabilities and suggested that

                        team to consult on how make best use of resources available for this

                        clearer picture of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 situation, but we should soon be in

                        urge that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> be given preferential
                        treatment; nor did he refer to possible adverse political and economic

                            which has been approved at high level, has necessitated relocation of
                            KC–135's which provide <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> fighter
                            support. We are considering a proposal to base ten <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> support tankers (five from Takhil
                            and five from Kadena) and five U-Tapao based radio relay aircraft at
                            Ching Chuan Kang by approximately February 1, 1968. It is necessary to
                            redeploy these KC–135's in order to permit increased B–52 operations at
                            U-Tapao and F–111 deployment at Takhli. U-Tapao and Takhli are extremely
                            crowded and could not accommodate new deployments without reduction in
                            number of KC–135's. Move of KC–135's from Kadena to Ching Chuan Kang
                            will increase their effectiveness since they will be based nearer to
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> refueling areas. Operation from
                            Ching Chuan Kang will require 432 additional US personnel. No new
                            construction would be needed. As you know, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has previously approved KC–135's use of Ching Chuan
                            Kang as weather alternate, and it has been so used.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, it might be useful for me
                            to review for you my Government's views on the purpose of our meetings.
                            Our objectives are threefold: First and foremost, we view them as a
                            forum through which our two Governments can work gradually toward
                            greater mutual understanding and begin to break down the barriers and
                            antagonisms which have stood between us. Secondly, we see in them a
                            point of contact where urgent and critical matters relating to the
                            national interests of our two countries and to world peace can be
                            communicated in private and with full frankness. Thirdly, we see in them
                            an opportunity to exchange views on other problems and issues which
                            either of us may feel it useful to raise with the other.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>We succeeded, in the opening meetings in this series in 1955, in
                            reaching agreement on the return of civilians to their own countries. In
                            retrospect and even in spite of our many disagreements over the
                            implementation of that initial agreement, it represented a significant
                            step forward toward the resolution of specific problems. As I have noted
                            before, we have never seen why, after gradually releasing so many of the
                            American citizens being detained in your country, you drew the line at
                            the handful who still remain.</item>

                            despite the efforts of my Government to pose various means of improving
                            relations between the peoples of our two countries, your Government has
                            limited itself more and more to repetition of editorials, commentaries,
                            and general statements on international affairs already given wide
                            publicity by your radio and news media.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, I and my Government are
                            indeed interested in the views of your Government on matters of general
                            international concern. But let us also get on with the substantive, and
                            we would hope productive, business of our meetings.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, your Government is aware,
                            I am sure, of the existence of the International Telecommunications
                            Satellite Corporation (<gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>)
                            established in 1964. I would at this point like to call your
                            Government's attention to a message addressed by President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> to the US Congress on August 14, 1967
                            on membership in <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>. The
                            President stated: 'We support a global system of commercial satellite
                            communications which is available to all nations—large and small,
                            developed <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0660"/>and developing—on a
                            non-discriminatory basis … We seek no domination of satellite
                            communications to the exclusion of any other nation—or group of
                            nations.'</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, the scientists of your
                            country have demonstrated their skill, ingenuity, and competence in many
                            fields. Conceivably, one day in the not too distant future astronauts of
                            your country will join those of other nations in venturing into the
                            exciting and enormously important exploration of space. In this
                            connection, my Government believes that it would be in the interest of
                            both our countries for us to reach an understanding on the question of
                            rescue and return of astronauts and space vehicles. I would be
                            interested in the views of your Government on this subject.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, as your country continues
                            to carry out nuclear tests, I am sure that the enormous power and
                            destructive potential of nuclear weapons is becoming increasingly clear
                            to the political, military, and scientific leaders of your country. The
                            need to control these weapons, to avert their use, and to move gradually
                            toward disarmament can hardly be open to doubt by anyone today. We have
                            sought repeatedly, Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, to have
                            your Government clarify and spell out in detail its views on controlling
                            nuclear weapons and on constructive moves toward disarmament which would
                            preserve the security of all states. Unilateral declarations on the use
                            of nuclear weapons and calls for uncontrolled and uninspected
                            disarmament obviously do not answer the real problems of security and
                            assurance in a world in which mutual trust and confidence are
                            imperfect.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, my Government, together
                            with other nations, has been engaged in serious negotiations designed to
                            conclude an agreement barring the further spread of nuclear weapons. On
                            July 31, 1963 your Government issued a statement on disarmament, part
                            (2) C of which specifically called for 'the prohibition of the export
                            and import of nuclear weapons and technical data on their manufacture.'
                            As I understand your language, its spirit is precisely in keeping with
                            the purpose of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which I just referred. I
                            would hope your Government will be willing to look at the Treaty in this
                            light and join with many other states in seeking by practical and
                            progressive steps to deal with this and other problems of
                            disarmament.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: If Ch'en raises <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question, you should make statement
                            below, but not otherwise. Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, I
                            am sure your Government has noted the various public statements in
                            recent months about the United States decision to deploy an
                            anti-ballistic missile system, but I would like to underscore one or two
                            points. In the first place, it is clear that it is purely defensive. It
                            employs components which cannot conceivably in themselves present a
                            threat to any nation. In the absence of mutual assurances that offer
                            hope for an end to the arms race and the spread of <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0661"/>nuclear weapons, we reluctantly felt
                            that prudence demanded we make the deployment. Our interest in putting
                            an end to the arms race and the huge expenditures of human and material
                            resources that it entails remains undiminished. We would much prefer
                            ourselves to devote our resources to the enormous tasks that remain
                            unfinished, both in our own country and in others, in housing,
                            education, transportation, health and welfare. Is this not a common goal
                            we both share and toward which we should both be able to work and
                            cooperate?</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, I mentioned earlier the
                            achievements of your country's scientists in many fields. I would like
                            to take particular note of your achievements in the field of insulin
                            chemistry. Such progress, like that in heart surgery recently achieved
                            in South Africa, and that in synthesizing a protein virus in my country,
                            should be shared with all scientists without regard to politics. We
                            regret that, at the present time, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is the only major scientific country in the world which
                            is unwilling to permit open, widespread exchange of scientists and
                            scientific, unclassified research and information with the US. We would
                            like to see such exchanges and I am prepared to discuss with you now or
                            at a subsequent meeting means of remedying this situation, and assure
                            you of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s desire to encourage
                            exchanges of visits between your scientists and ours.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires, I have discussed with you
                            at length on previous occasions my Government's views on the Vietnam
                            conflict, our reasons for involvement in that conflict, and our limited
                            objectives and willingness to withdraw our forces from Vietnam when the
                            threat to the security of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> has ended.
                            I have made it clear that we do not seek to invade North Vietnam or to
                            destroy or change the Government in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            and, in the same context, made clear we do not seek a wider war, that we
                            do not intend to attack your country, and do not have any territorial
                            aspirations in that entire area. We sincerely hope your Government
                            understands this. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: If in his
                            opening statement, Ch'en includes direct threat against US, you should
                            note that this is a matter of gravest consequence you can only report to
                            your Govt and follow with remainder of <gloss target="#t_para1">para</gloss> 14. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.) We also
                            hope your Government has considered—as we have—the grave consequences
                            which a war between our two countries would have. To wish to avert such
                            a conflict is not cowardice or a sign of being what your Chairman calls
                            a 'paper tiger'. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            responded on October 12 to a question whether the main US objective in
                            Asia was the so-called 'containment' of your country with an emphatic
                            'No. The central objective is an organized and reliable peace.' But we
                            will assist those countries that feel themselves threatened and to whom
                            we have pledged our support and friendship. There should be not the
                            faintest germ of doubt in your Government's appreciation of that
                            fact.</item>

                        <item>It is sometimes difficult for one country to understand the
                            psychology, the 'style' of another. And because the American system
                            permits all views to be expressed openly, allows all kinds of dissent
                            and debate, it is sometimes possible for other countries with different
                            patterns and traditions of political and social behavior and action to
                            mistake the workings of the democratic process and the free expression
                            of diverse opinions in the US for weakness or lack of

                            two countries. We are convinced that you know these are not purposefully
                            and intentionally precipitated. But despite our most persistent efforts,
                            it occasionally happens that as a result of malfunction or navigational
                            error, US aircraft do intrude briefly and shallowly into your
                            territorial airspace. We will continue to take every practicable measure

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>Dean</persName>:</p>
                    <p>It has been some time since I felt it worthwhile to bother you with a
                        separate personal reaction to one of our meetings with the Chinese. As you
                        know from the formal reporting of the last two or three meetings, the
                        Chinese posture of sterility and rigidity did not encourage me to believe
                        that a new initiative on our part would have any significant impact.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere and substance of the January 8 meeting, however, was enough
                        improved over the preceding two or three sessions to raise my hopes a small
                        notch. The “signals” that intrigue me include the following: (a) By holding
                        this meeting, despite the absence of Ambassador <persName>Wang</persName>,
                        by volunteering that the Charge contact is a temporary exigency, and by
                        readily agreeing to a reasonable date for the next meeting, the Chinese made
                        clear their desire to maintain their contact with us; (b) They reverted to
                        their pre-cultural revolution position that Taiwan is <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0667"/>the sole issue poisoning relations between
                        China and the U.S., as against their position over the past couple of years
                        that their conflict with us involved differences encompassing the whole
                        world revolutionary movement; (c) They devoted their entire opening
                        statement to strictly bilateral issues—Taiwan and an itemized listing of air
                        intrusions, attacks on ships, etc.—and during rebuttal made only perfunctory
                        references to Viet-Nam, avoiding the several issues which I expected them to
                        vigorously exploit, including the current Cambodian troubles and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s ABM speech; (d) There was a
                        sharp downturn in invective as compared to each of the other meetings in
                        which I have participated, and a complete absence of reference to the
                        cultural revolution and the sayings of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>; (e) The routine follow-up meeting the next morning
                        between <persName corresp="#p_KPH1">Kreisberg</persName> and Anderson (my
                        counselor and interpreter) with their Chinese counterparts<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">At these follow-up meetings, both sides exchanged the
                            texts of their opening statements. A memorandum of the conversation at
                            the January 9 meeting was transmitted in airgram A–421, January 11.
                            (Ibid.)</note> was pervaded by a surprising atmosphere of relaxation.
                        There was an unusual engagement by the Chinese in conversation on general
                        interest subjects such as American balance of payment problems, the source
                        of our oil supply, and details of their interpreter's vacation in China
                        (including his labor experience on farm and in factory), all in a tone of
                        genuine interest rather than criticism.</p>
                    <p>Lord knows, one swallow does not make a summer, and tone and atmosphere are
                        no substitute for action. Yet I cannot help but think that the items
                        catalogued in the last paragraph add up to a significant departure from the
                        past performance. Why I do not know, although one can hypothesize that this
                        has something to do with the improved position of Ch'en Yi and the Chinese
                        Foreign Ministry professionals and a corresponding downgrading of the
                        influence on foreign policy of hard-nosed Cultural Revolution types.</p>
                    <p>I believe, therefore, that this would be the appropriate time for the
                        President or you to again make a major speech designed to appeal to and
                        encourage the moderate element in Communist China. If the Chinese posture at
                        this meeting was designed to signal a positive change in China's policy
                        toward us, and I do not believe we can lightly discard this hypothesis, it
                        is important for us to quickly respond. Such a response would implicitly let
                        them know that we recognize and appreciate this change, and could emphasize
                        the clear benefits that would accrue to them were relations between China
                        and the United States improved. Aside from a general reiteration of the
                        theme of your statement to the Zablocki Committee in 1966 and the
                        President's State of the Union message last year, I would hope that the
                        speech I am suggesting could offer some <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0668"/>additional areas in which we could move without serious
                        political risk or weakening significant U.S. interests.<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">The source text is filed with a January 18 covering
                            memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> to
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> stating that <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>'s basic thesis but did not
                            think the timing was right for a top-level speech. He suggested that a
                            speech by <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> scheduled
                            for February 16 might be “a good vehicle to satisfy <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>'s desire to probe a little.”
                            He concluded: “It seems to me that affairs on the mainland are still
                            much too messy for us to use our bluest chips in the game. Let's save
                            'em a while longer.”</note>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that the visiting China specialists had
                        examined three subjects for discussion with the President: (1) the situation
                        in China; (2) alternative future directions of the evolving situation; and
                        (3) policy considerations for the United States. They expected to
                        concentrate on the last of these.</p>
                    <p>The President welcomed the participants, saying that he valued the
                        opportunity to hear their recommendations on policy alternatives concerning
                            <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0669"/>China. He said that we had been
                        following two channels in our China policy: bridge-building on the one hand
                        and necessary deterrents on the other. The President invited comment from
                        the participants in turn around the table.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Reischauer said that he was especially heartened by the
                        President's reference to China in his July 12, 1966 speech. He felt that
                        this time of disorder in China might be a good time to show our flexibility.
                        In doing so, we would look beyond present crises. We should lay out our
                        reconciliation approach now.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that we do not, in fact, hold to a rigid course of
                        action. We are keeping our options open.</p>
                    <p>Professor Eckstein said he thought it encouraging that we had offered an
                        exchange of agricultural expertise, of seeds, etc., and that in recent times
                        we had broadened considerably our efforts at contact. He thought we should
                        go further and relax our embargo against Chinese goods. This would not be of
                        much economic importance, but would have political value in indicating more
                        flexibility. He thought it would entail no serious risks concerning China's
                        war-making potential.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Thomas</persName> said that he was not a China specialist, but
                        he would like to direct to the President's attention what he thought to be
                        public concern about China. Recently, under National Committee on U.S.-China
                        Relations sponsorship, a Norwegian journalist, Mr.
                            <persName>Munthe-Kaas</persName>, had spoken in 22 cities throughout the
                        country. Without exception, audiences were anxious to hear and talk about
                        China. the predominant opinion seemed to be in favor of a more flexible
                        approach to that country, including trade.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that we have to keep hammering away at this. He said
                        that he would like to get a “Presidential commission” to keep at it.
                        East-West trade was only one thing the public was interested in, however. It
                        was also interested in Vietnam. That is the great cost of Vietnam—because of
                        it we do not get the chance to do some of the other things which would be
                        desirable.</p>
                    <p>Professor Pye said that we must look beyond Vietnam to China, the really big
                        problem. The reporters may be provocative, but we must not let that affect
                        our perspective. We should approach China at the big-problem level. We
                        should discuss with China such issues as non-proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons, disarmament, etc. There should be a dialogue on that sort of thing
                        at Warsaw. We should try to get China to see the nature of the world to
                        come. It is true that we cannot negotiate with China today, but we should
                        engage in this kind of discussion just as we did with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> said that the group
                        held differing views as to the need for considering initiatives just at this
                        time. China is going through a period of great change and is very disrupted.
                        Even now, however, he <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0670"/>himself felt
                        we should look beyond Vietnam. He, too, liked the flavor of the President's
                        July 1966 speech. We should even now be working out the steps implied in
                        that speech. He agreed with Professor Eckstein that we should keep going
                        beyond consideration of Vietnam. We should remove trade restrictions except
                        for the basic <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list. We should get
                        China into the international community. We should work actively toward
                        achieving dual Chinese representation in the United Nations. Professor
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> said he was impressed by
                        the value of an advisor like <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                        on the Soviet Union. He felt that we needed a man of similar seniority to
                        advise on China.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the group to submit nominations. He said he needed at his
                        elbow an advisor on the Soviet Union, and he had had both <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> in that role. He needed the same for China. There has
                        been a failure to communicate with the Chinese. The President said he had
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> to go to Warsaw to
                        carry on the talks because he thought he had the qualifications which would
                        make it possible to communicate. Unfortunately, however, the Chinese have
                        continued to insist that they are interested in discussing nothing except
                        Taiwan. The President said he had tried hard to bring about communication
                        but he had failed. He said that he was, of course, ultimately responsible
                        for such a failure, just as President Kennedy took the responsibility for
                        failure in the Bay of Pigs. We have made a truly major effort to communicate
                        and to keep our policy flexible. We are not hidebound. Since there has been
                        no response to our efforts, we must be doing something wrong.</p>
                    <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> maintained that we
                        had not failed, because as long as <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> was there we simply could not expect any response. He
                        thought it important, however, to keep making attempts.</p>
                    <p>The President thought perhaps we were not searching enough. Competent men
                        were needed to put on assignments of this kind. Also needed just now were a
                        dozen men for ambassadorships and for some other posts throughout the
                        government. Actually, we need Reischauer in a dozen places.</p>
                    <p>Professor Eckstein said we need people, for instance, at the deputy assistant
                        secretary level, who know a great deal about China. As for China, there is
                        more hope of change than there has been for a long time. There is transition
                        to something quite dissimilar—perhaps in time to be compared to the changes
                        in the Soviet Union. The dialogue which is possible now may be minimal, but
                        our policy of reconciliation should go right along (sic). It is very
                        important that we focus a great deal of attention on China because that
                        situation could get quite messy, and later China may contain a third of the
                        population of the world. We should get China into the United Nations. Public
                        discussion is one way to get around present pressures. The Charter should be
                        revised. Professor Eckstein further expressed the belief that every country
                        calling itself a state <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0671"/>should
                        accept the responsibility of a state and should automatically be in the
                        United Nations. That would mean North Korea, North and South Vietnam and all
                        other entities acting as countries. If such a position were taken, it might
                        even lead to the acceptance by both Peking and Taiwan of the presence of the
                        other in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said that he detected a
                        changing mood in the country; in the business community, in labor circles,
                        in civic groups and in churches. He said the Committee represented by this
                        group constituted an answer to the rigidities represented in the Committee
                        of One Million. The time has come to engage in more open discussions.</p>
                    <p>The President said we were going through a dangerous period in this respect.
                        It is hard to wage a major war against one communist group without having
                        the public oppose all communists. It is amazing, however, that we can go
                        through the Vietnam experience and not have more clamor against the Soviet
                        Union. The President said he thought Professor Eckstein was right in his
                        evaluation of the openmindedness found among various groups in the country.
                        This is surprising when we look at the contributions of the McCarthy period.
                        We would expect emotions now to be even higher in view of the Pueblo
                        capture, and talk of cutting off the head of President Park and of killing
                        the American Ambassador. Perhaps people are too busy wanting to stop the
                        bombing to think of these things. We must carry on an endurance contest in
                        Vietnam in such a way as not to lead to inflexibility on other issues.</p>
                    <p>Professor Scalapino cautioned that in the case of China we are dealing with
                        exceedingly complex issues. If we are to count on moderation in the American
                        people's viewpoint, we will have to keep reiterating that these questions
                        are indeed complex and not subject to simple formulae for resolution. The
                        American people today can grasp a high level of complexities if they are led
                        to do so. They can, for instance, understand the import of so-called
                        “people's wars” if they are explained. The real problem is that so long as
                        the Maoists are in control they will try to cause trouble such as in Burma,
                        other parts of Asia (the President interjected “and the Dominican
                        Republic”).</p>
                    <p>The President said he fully agreed that the American people were ready to
                        understand complexities and that complex issues did not have to be put in
                        simple terms which might be misleading.</p>
                    <p>In concluding, the President said that, firstly, he very much appreciated the
                        fact that the group had come to talk with him. Secondly, he had profited
                        from the discussion and, thirdly, he wanted to ask of the group two things: <list>
                            <item>—that two or three members of the group write for him a directive
                                as though addressed to the Secretary of State, asking him to take
                                steps “A through F”—things which ought to be done concerning
                                China;</item>
                            <item>—recommend someone who could serve as a counterpart to <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>.</item>

                    <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0672"/>
                    <p>The President also said that he would welcome hearing from any member of the
                        group at any time on suggestions concerning the Warsaw talks, or any other
                        suggestions concerning China. The President then briefly reviewed recent
                        events leading up to an atmosphere of crisis, which built up all through
                        January. In closing, the President invited the professors to “play
                        President” in preparing for him the memo, and also to write him their full
                        thoughts in letters within the next six weeks or so.</p>

                        <item>I am scheduled to address Cincinnati Council on World Affairs February
                            16 on subject US policy toward Communist China. I regret final draft not
                            completed in time provide you with full text but believe you should be
                            aware of general thrust and particularly those portions dealing
                            specifically with our policy toward <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Principal objectives this speech are to clarify certain misconceptions
                            and misunderstandings regarding US policy toward Chinese Communist
                            regime on mainland and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, to relate
                            both these aspects of our China policy and attempt to remove some of
                            ambiguities which have arisen in this area, and to reiterate our
                            willingness to continue to seek reconciliation with mainland China.
                            Speech does not announce any new departures in specific courses of
                            action which would alter actual substance of our relations with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> or Communist China. It details at some
                            length record of Chinese Communist self-isolation, persistent hostility
                            toward US, and threat posed by its aggressive posture toward outside
                            world. It also reiterates fact that US commitment to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not open to negotiation and that US
                            cannot accept Chinese Communist demand for participation in any
                            international body to exclusion of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>However, although noting that Peking's refusal to expand and improve
                            contacts between US and Communist China makes unrealistic any suggestion
                            that US recognize Peking, speech acknowledges possibility for movement
                            in that direction at some point if Peking's attitudes change. In
                            addition, speech makes clear that US has been treating, and is prepared
                            to continue to treat, separately with government of mainland China and
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. In so doing speech employs
                            somewhat more restrictive definition of substance of our relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> than has been used in past.
                            Portions of draft which bear on these points and others which we
                            anticipate will be especially sensitive with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are as follows:</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>US recognition of Chinese Communist control of mainland: “… it must be
                            perfectly clear to anyone who has looked at this history of last 18
                            years that USG does not doubt existence of Communist China. We fought
                            against its soldiers in Korea. We have negotiated with its
                            representatives in international conferences in Geneva twice. We have
                            maintained regular bilateral contact with it on an Ambassadorial level
                            for 14 years, first in Geneva and now in Warsaw. Territory controlled
                            and administered by Peking is well known to Government of US and when
                            matters arise which pertain to this area and involve interests of US or
                            American citizens, obviously our approach is to Chinese Communist
                            authorities. This is reality and it fully acknowledged by this
                            Government.”</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Relations between US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>: “What is
                            this relationship? It is one of friendship going back many years, of
                            mutual respect, and of common security interests in present
                            circumstances in Asia. The United States recognizes the Government of
                            Republic of China and deals with that Government on matters which, for
                            most part, relate to areas over which it exercises actual control.
                            Demands of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, accompanied by
                            threats of force and use of force, for control of Taiwan are, of course,
                            totally unacceptable. There can be no bargaining with lives of more than
                            13 million people who have made clear their rejection of Chinese
                            Communist control. Under our treaty of 1954 with the Republic of China,
                            we have a commitment to help it defend itself against an armed
                            attack.</item>

                        <item>Whatever final resolution there may ultimately be to question of
                            Taiwan, it should, in all events, meet with approval of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and its people, whose interests are
                            most directly affected. Given present posture of Peking, including its
                            totally unfounded allegation that island is under US occupation, there
                            is at present no means of resolving this issue. Therefore, our best hope
                            is to see whether progress can be made on other issues and problems
                            creating strain between the United States and Communist China.”</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Trade embargo: “I noted earlier situation in Korean war under which
                            our present restrictions on trade and remittance of funds to Communist
                            China were put into effect. Certainly while Korean war continued there
                            could have been no question of trade with a country with <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0674"/>whose soldiers we were engaged in
                            fierce conflict. In years since then, admittedly situation has changed
                            very considerably. Peking itself has grown increasingly able to produce
                            many industrial materials which it needs. And gradually more and more
                            states, including many such as Japan, Australia, and West Germany which
                            do not recognize the Peking regime, have in fact entered into active
                            trade with mainland China in non-strategic goods and commodities. Peking
                            has consistently, however, for many years given no hint whatsoever of
                            any interest in trading with the United States. Rather it has rejected
                            even the vaguest hints that such trade might be possible. … In recent
                            months USG has been reviewing this trade policy to determine if it would
                            be feasible and in our interest to remove barriers on our side to
                            mutually beneficial trade in non-strategic goods with mainland. We are
                            doing this in belief that such peaceful trade should be possible without
                            harming our strategic interests in area.”</item>

                        <item>US-Chinese confrontation: “We are convinced that no war is inevitable.
                            Seen in terms of national interests of our two countries, there no
                            fundamental reason why United States and Communist China should come
                            into conflict and every reason for us both to exert every effort to
                            avert such a disaster. … US hopes for better relations with mainland
                            China. It recognizes as I have said earlier that major differences exist
                            in our political, social, and economic systems as well as on many
                            concrete issues. Their resolution will be difficult and probably slow.
                            Interests not only of US but of many other states deeply concerned over
                            security, economic development, and political and social progress in
                            Asia are involved. US recognizes that major interests of Chinese both on
                            mainland of China and on Taiwan are also involved. There is need for all
                            concerned to work toward lessening of tensions without abandoning or
                            surrendering values and interests. United States intends to continue to
                            strive toward this goal. We hope that Peking will alter its absolute
                            opposition and resistance to these efforts on our part. We hope also
                            that it will change its dedication to violent revolutionary overthrow of
                            governments and social structures which do not match its image of
                            society. We recognize that our abilities to influence rate at which this
                            occurs are limited and that such changes will fundamentally be result of
                            changed perceptions derived from within Chinese society and leadership
                            itself. But we convinced that these changes will occur. When they do,
                            United States will be prepared to respond positively to them.”</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>We recognize likelihood that statement of US policy along above lines

                        miles off the coast of Hainan. The plane was one of two unarmed aircraft
                        that had strayed into Chinese air space while en route from the Philippines
                        to Danang. The pilot of the other plane reported that he had seen a

                        wanted to launch a rescue helicopter from the USS Kearsarge at 0400 Vietnam
                        time, with fighter aircraft from the carrier Coral Sea providing protection.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName>'s memorandum states that Secretary of State

                        arguing that the risk to the helicopter crew was too great and that the man
                        was in Chinese territorial waters, and that Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also opposed it. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Chairman General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and Secretary of Defense-designate

                        memorandum of 12:40 p.m. states that the fighter aircraft were to remain 25
                        miles off shore unless the helicopter was attacked and that the entire
                        rescue party was under strict instruction to initiate no hostile action.

                        well as the risk to the helicopter crew. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> proposed launching an electronic aircraft outside
                        the 12-mile limit to determine if beeps from the pilot's beeper were
                        drifting out to sea, and the President approved this action. (Notes of

                    <p>A February 14 memorandum from <persName>Rostow</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> states that the President wanted
                        a full but very prompt investigation of the reasons for violation of Chinese
                        Communist air space during the previous year, including a complete report
                        concerning the latest incident; it had been reported to him that there had
                        been nine such violations. He wanted the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a matter
                        of high and urgent priority, to undertake steps to eliminate, if possible,
                        the likelihood of further such violations. (Washington National Records

                        other unconfirmed violations. He forwarded a February 17 memorandum from

                        avoid such incidents, including efforts to keep aircraft away from Chinese
                        territory and improvements in radar and communications. (Filed with a

                        <item>From standpoint of our relations here it is regrettable that speech

                            will be construed as accepting and enhancing the Communists on the

                            small island regime and even obliquely raising some question as to

                            Chinese here will be dismayed, discouraged and puzzled as to reasons for

                            even the strong negative reaction anticipated by you. I do not
                            anticipate a violent explosive reaction, but the suspicions and
                            resentments engendered by assumed policy change striking at the
                            foundations of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position will
                            continuously inject a corrosive element into our relationship. There are
                            enough variables and unknowns in the equation to make me hesitant to
                            attempt to evaluate at this stage the precise extent of the probable

                    <p>The Weekly Review of February 16, 1968, prepared in the Central Intelligence
                        Agency's Directorate of Intelligence, included a section entitled “Soviets
                        Continue To Expand Forces on Chinese Border.” It stated that Soviet ground
                        forces had been augmented in the last half of 1967 in regions bordering
                        China in the Far East and Transbaykal Military Districts. Before the
                        reinforcement began, about 21 ground divisions were deployed in regions
                        along the Chinese border, whereas only 15 divisions were maintained in those
                        areas prior to 1965, when significant Soviet reinforcement began.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You have asked for our views on the situation in Communist China, Sino-Soviet
                        relations, and Communist Chinese foreign policies—and on the resulting
                        possibilities for change in our own policies. Tab A, attached, is a
                        thoughtful and sound discussion of these matters, looking predominantly to
                        the longer term.</p>
                    <p>For immediate purposes, I believe we can take only very limited steps, since
                        our firm posture in Asia generally remains crucial and any significant
                        “concessions” to Communist China would be seriously misunderstood in key
                        quarters, not to mention the Congress. Specifically: <list>

                            <item>I do not believe we should change our posture toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Even the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s technical organs are, as a practical matter,
                                inseparable for now from the wider question of the General
                                Assembly.</item>

                            <item>On private contacts, we have the option of quiet action to extend
                                our passport policy for travel to Communist China so that we grant
                                passports to anyone who applies. This could be done in the near
                                future, since it has become customary to define our travel policy
                                for publication in the Federal Register on March 15 of each year. A
                                routine announcement at that time should attract no major notice,
                                and would ratify what we have in fact been doing on individual
                                applications for some time. If this commends itself to you, I will
                                put a precise paper before you for decision. The practical effect
                                will almost certainly be nil, since Peking has not admitted any
                                American for some time.</item>

                            <item>On trade, there are certain minimal steps we could also take in
                                the near future. These would affect (a) our attempt to apply US
                                trade controls to US subsidiaries abroad (a major source of friction
                                with friendly countries, and one we have frequently waived under
                                pressure); (b) certain outmoded controls on bunkering of ships; and
                                (c) removal of the requirement of Certificates of Origin on
                                Chinese-type goods, for purchases <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0680"/>up to $100 (largely an annoyance, but with some
                                balance-of-payments implications in the current situation). A
                                broader possibility would be (d) a change in export license policy
                                to permit export to Communist China of foodstuffs, fertilizer,
                                insecticides, and farm machinery. All of these relate directly to
                                food only, and the mere act of relaxing would be widely noted and I
                                think more applauded than condemned. Again, if this possibility
                                commends itself to you, I will put a precise paper before you for
                                individual decision in the near future.</item>

                            <item>conclude with the basic thought that we must keep Communist China
                                always in mind in our choice of military actions in Viet-Nam and
                                elsewhere. I do not think we are running any significant risks on
                                present lines, but any proposal for new or increased action must
                                take full account of this factor.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>After a year and a half of turmoil, Peking's major emphasis is on
                            channeling the Cultural Revolution into non-disruptive channels,
                            restoring order, and seeking to restore its controls over the country as
                            a whole and to re-establish a system of administration. This emphasis is
                            articulated largely by the military—which has assumed an increasing
                            role—and by the remnants of the governmental administrative
                            apparatus.</p>
                        <p>The Cultural Revolution appears, at the present stage, to have had two
                            major objectives—to enhance <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName>'s own power through the removal of his prime
                            political opponents, and to carry through <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s revolutionary and Utopian ideas of destroying the
                            old society, remolding the individual, and establishing an idealized
                            Communist society.</p>
                        <p>The results have been the crushing of organized opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, but at immense cost: first, to
                            leadership cohesion and Party and government institutions; secondly, a
                            near-total failure of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s aims
                            of social and political changes; thirdly, mounting national
                            disillusionment and cynicism, and loss of confidence in <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and Maoism; and fourthly,
                            incalculable economic and social dislocation.</p>
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0681"/>
                        <p>Today, rather than pressing on with the Cultural Revolution, the
                            leadership is seeking to control the forces they themselves unleashed
                            and to recreate institutional controls and a basic structure of power to
                            replace the one they themselves have weakened.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Peking regime faces staggering problems as it seeks to hold China
                            together and restore order. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                            and his more dedicated followers have not given up their dream of
                            creating a new social order, and will seek opportunities to restore the
                            momentum of the Cultural Revolution. Factionalism at all levels remains
                            high, and steps taken to recreate the administrative structure
                            inevitably feed the factionalism by restoring to power many of those
                            only recently under attack. The People's Liberation Army has been given
                            the task of policing the country in addition to national defense. Yet it
                            is both inhibited by the Maoists from exerting the force necessary to
                            restore order and reluctant to do so for fear of exacerbating the severe
                            tensions the PLA is already under.</p>
                        <p>Looking somewhat further into the future, whatever success the present
                            uneasy power equilibrium achieves in controlling disorders, re-knitting
                            the social and economic fabric and rebuilding the administrative
                            structure of the country is apt to be set back by the death of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s health is not good, and it is unlikely he will
                            survive for long. His death (or total incapacitation) would remove an
                            important, if now somewhat tarnished, symbol of national unity, and
                            would immediately sharpen the struggle for power.</p>
                        <p>In summary, China appears to face a period of some years of instability
                            and internal preoccupation. The Cultural Revolution has set loose forces
                            that will make most difficult the task of restoring order and momentum
                            to China's society and economy by any new leadership that may
                            emerge.</p>

                        <p>While this situation contains obvious elements of uncertainty and danger
                            for the stability of East Asia, it also contains elements of opportunity
                            for the United States. These elements revolve around the possibility
                            that the disillusionment over Maoism and the increasingly pressing
                            nature of China's internal problems will bring with them, on the part of
                            a new leadership, a re-examination of the premises and priorities of
                            China's foreign policy.</p>

                        <p>The close relations existing between Peking and Moscow from 1949–58
                            represent an exceptional interlude in the much longer historical pattern
                            of mutual suspicion and hostility between China and Russia. This
                            history, the long common border populated by ethnic minorities <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0682"/>which have been politically
                            restive under both Chinese and Russian rule, and conflicting ideological
                            and national objectives make it unlikely that a long-term relationship
                            of friendship and cooperation between the two can be re-established.</p>
                        <p>The death of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> would remove
                            certain personal obstacles to improvement in Sino-Soviet relations, but
                            unless accompanied by a break-down of order in China, this would not
                            fundamentally change the strategic relationship between China, the
                            Soviets, and ourselves. Moscow will be alert for opportunities to
                            improve its relations with Peking without sacrificing basic Soviet
                            interests, but any such improvement would in all likelihood be based on
                            a relationship of full independence, with each clearly conscious of the
                            dividing line between areas of common and competitive interest.</p>
                        <p>One evident common interest is their mutual desire to weaken the
                            international position of the U.S. This could provide a basis for
                            tactical collaboration on some specific issues which would be damaging
                            to U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>We do not rule out the possibility that either in conjunction with or
                            independent of a lessening of overt Sino-Soviet tensions, the Chinese
                            could move to lessen tensions with the U.S. We should certainly seek,
                            within the context of our other Asian interests, to make this
                            alternative as attractive as possible to Peking.</p>
                        <p>Peking's policy objectives with respect to its other Asian neighbors,
                            particularly in Southeast Asia, will probably continue to focus on
                            drawing these states into Peking's orbit of political and economic
                            influence and detaching them from close relationships with the U.S.
                            After a very harsh period last spring and summer, in which major threats
                            were laid out against several countries in the area, Peking has now
                            moderated its tactics, although it may be launching a significant
                            subversive effort against Burma. In general, if the situation in
                            Southeast Asia were to soften through adverse developments in Viet-Nam,
                            we might expect to see some increase in pressure and subversion from
                            Peking, notably in Thailand, but the degree to which this was pressed
                            would depend heavily on conditions in the area. Moreover, we can reckon
                            that Peking's internal problems will somewhat reduce the degree of
                            pressure from what would have been foreseen prior to the Cultural
                            Revolution, and specifically in the 1965 period when the U.S. made its
                            major decision on Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>More broadly, and looking into the future, our best forecast would be
                            that the over-all goal of major influence, and when possible control, in
                            key parts of Southeast Asia will probably be shared by <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s successors whoever they may be.
                            Specific tactical approaches used toward this end will vary, as they
                            have since 1949. Should <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                            successors, however, become less rigidly committed to the concept of a
                            Maoist revolutionary development in the world—as we strongly suggest
                            they eventually <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0683"/>will—the
                            insurrectionary-subversionary element in Peking's foreign policy may be
                            gradually de-emphasized.</p>
                        <p>In dealing with the rest of the world, Peking will continue to be
                            handicapped by its limited resources and will probably gradually begin
                            to accept the limitations on its abilities to influence or control the
                            actions of other states. The problems of an internal leadership
                            transition will also hamper the formulation and implementation of
                            foreign policy. The general outlines of Peking's policies, however, will
                            probably continue: emphasis on developing relations with Afro-Asian
                            states, willingness to deal on a practical basis on economic and trade
                            matters with even certain states it does not recognize, and avoidance of
                            war, if at all possible, with major powers.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The likelihood of a change in Peking's policies toward the United States
                            is minimal in the next few years, and probably nil while <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is alive. Nevertheless, Peking has
                            been willing, at some political cost, to keep open the
                            Ambassadorial-level contact in Warsaw and clearly sees an advantage in
                            having a communication point with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Especially given the current fluid state of Peking's politics, we believe
                            it is in the interest of the U.S. to present to a potential or emerging
                            Chinese leadership a variety of options and alternatives to their
                            present policies.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Alternatives to U.S. Policies</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have, in the past few years, made initial moves in this direction by
                            offering increasing contact through travel and limited types of trade
                            and by attempting to institute a dialogue with Peking on disarmament.
                            Further moves in respect to travel and trade can probably be taken
                            without damage to U.S. security interests. We should also act to
                            minimize potential points of irritation and direct conflict with Peking,
                            and this applies particularly to self-restraint in U.S. military air and
                            naval operations close to Chinese borders.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing that can presently be done directly to resolve the
                            problem of Taiwan. We are committed to its defense but for all practical
                            purposes deal with Peking and Taipei as if they were separate states.
                            This is a direction toward which our policies have been taking us for 15
                            years and it is probably in our interest to work gradually toward at
                            least a tacit acknowledgement of this reality by both.</p>
                        <p>So long as Peking's policies remain militant and hostile, there is no net
                            U.S. advantage to be gained from Chinese Communist participation in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s political organizations. If
                            Peking were to moderate its policies even to a limited degree, we would
                            almost certainly be confronted by growing pressure from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to bring Communist China into the
                                <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0684"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, even if this resulted in withdrawal
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. There are, even at present,
                            significant advantages which might be derived from Peking's membership
                            in a number of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s technical
                            organizations (<gloss target="#t_WMO1">WMO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ITU1">ITU</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_UPU1">UPU</gloss>). It is politically difficult to
                            accomplish this, however, without bringing Peking into the General
                            Assembly or the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>In general, we anticipate in the middle-long run that China's attitude
                            toward the United States will be subject not only to changes in Peking's
                            leadership, which could result in some moderation of Peking's hostility
                            towards us permitting progress towards placing our relations on a more
                            pragmatic basis, but also to the future U.S. posture in East Asia and in
                            particular to the pattern of activities by the United States affecting
                            Chinese security interests. We do find it possible to envisage the
                            gradual development of practical cultural and economic relationships in
                            somewhat the same way as our relations have developed with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, even while our political
                            relationship remains a hostile one</p>
                        <p>At some point, it may be desirable to consider the advantage of
                            attempting to draw Peking more into Asian regional ventures such as the
                            Asian Development Bank, <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>, or the
                            Mekong Valley Project. We suspect Peking's initial reactions would be
                            negative but the attempt might usefully serve to underline that the U.S.
                            does not oppose Peking's taking part in peaceful economic development
                            programs with its Asian neighbors.</p>

                    <p>The term “madness” has been applied to the present climate in Peking. In some
                        ways it is not inappropriate. But to a Chinese, because of <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0685"/>the historical prologue to the present and
                        because of the Chinese way of viewing China and the world, much of the
                        “madness” is explained as inescapable logic and reason.</p>

                            Ignominy”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is something awesome about the world's oldest continuous civilization
                        relentlessly rending itself. Since a quarter of humanity is directly
                        involved, and the rest indirectly, China's current writhings are as
                        important as they are spectacular. The ancient Confucian way of life—for so
                        long the very cement of the Chinese race—has cracked and crumbled, and it is
                        not yet clear what will lastingly take its place.The nature of the
                        transformation could fundamentally affect not only the shape of Asia, but in
                        no small measure the character of world civilization itself.</p>
                    <p>China's self-conscious, embarrassed, but inevitable attack on its own past
                        actually has been going on for a century and a quarter—ever since the Opium
                        War of 1842 proved that an outrage, and then a long stream of outrages,
                        could be forced upon a great civilization which had neglected to develop the
                        gunboat prerequisite to self-determination.</p>
                    <p>China's struggle to destroy its persistent Confucian past and to come into
                        the modern world has been waged in varying manner and degree, but—at least
                        for the first hundred years—always against humiliating odds imposed by the
                        foreigners. “The imperialists” enjoyed extra-territorial rights, owned most
                        of China's large-scale production, regulated much of its trade, and even
                        managed its customs receipts! Through this bitter “hundred years of
                        ignominy” the Chinese developed a veritable burning in the belly for renewed
                        national dignity. And fantasies of sheer revenge—sweet revenge against the
                        white man's exploitation and presumption—often crowded out even those
                        fantasies of regained grandeur. The wounds of humiliation were all the
                        deeper because for over 3,000 years the Han people had considered that they
                        were only truly civilized people. Their “Middle Kingdom” was in their eyes
                        the center of the universe—in all literalness—and even by religious
                        sanction.</p>
                    <p>Especially since the turn of the century, China has made increasingly
                        urgent—almost frenzied—efforts to modernize into viability as a great power.
                        The republicanism of Sun Yat-sen and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> made some progress, and gave promise of more until
                        the Japanese war. The tragedy depleted the nation's energies, furthered the
                        disintegration of traditional ethics and mores, encouraged corruption in
                        officialdom, and led the Kuomintang's ruling circles to commit political
                        suicide by leaning ruinously on the hated foreigner.</p>
                    <p>During the war, the Chinese Communists won the peasants' loyalty in the large
                        agrarian pockets between the Japanese-held cities and lines of
                        communication. And at <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s cave
                        headquarters in Yenan, the degree <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0686"/>of self-sacrifice, patriotism, honesty and fraternity evident in that
                        temporary and unreal community won the praises of unbiased observers and the
                        allegiance of increasing numbers of Chinese of a whole spectrum of political
                        and economic persuasions.</p>
                    <p>The result was that in the Civil War the all-vital intelligence on troop
                        movements in the countryside was given to the Communists and not to the
                        Nationalists. In the cities not only many workers, but many students,
                        professional people and even some government officials worked clandestinely
                        for the Communists in the interest of China's new day.</p>
                    <p>And so China was “lost.” The enormity of that event was apparent, and the
                        United States entered on an orgy of self-flagellation.</p>
                    <p>For some seven years the Chinese Communists in many ways performed
                        impressively in bringing about a new China. The costs were high (e.g., up to
                        twenty million persons liquidated in the land reform period) but the nation
                        was united, at peace, and expectant. It forged ahead economically so that it
                        was widely spoken of as a model for other developing nations. It had
                        purposeful, cohered leadership which made a fetish of taking no guff from
                        foreigners. And soon, it must be admitted, the masses of Chinese were a
                        little better off—at least materially—than they had ever been. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, success-crowned, began to be deified,
                        and his works canonized.</p>
                    <p>(If more people, Chinese and others, had read his works earlier, the story
                        might have been different. The Mein Kampf-like candor of his writings would
                        have shown up the war-time “democratic, peace-loving, agrarian reformer” era
                        for what <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> intended it to be: a
                        temporary show-case period to gain support—a tactical way-station on the
                        road to communism. But not many of his writings at that time were in
                        English. I remember my feeble, worried efforts to spread what I had read in
                        Chinese and heard, but then I was just a Vice Consul from Georgia—and South

                    <p>The regime became overconfident, and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> (against significant opposition, it now appears) in 1957
                        launched the so-called Great Leap Forward. This attempt to force production
                        by rapid transition to extreme forms of social and economic organization was
                        a colossal failure. The Russians had strongly advised against the Great
                        Leap. Its economic dislocations disgusted them, its go-it-alone atmosphere
                        affronted them, and its ideological implications alarmed them. Relations
                        festered until in 1960 Russian aid and aiders were withdrawn, and the
                        communist giants split.</p>

                    <p>The failure of the Great Leap Forward was not only of domestic import; the
                        failure was on the international front, too, and that front was <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0687"/>desperately important to the Chinese view
                        of China's place in the sun—and to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s in history. China was no longer the economic model for
                        the Afro-Asian-Latin American world, and this fact began to register
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>That double failure, domestic and foreign, ironically made inevitable
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s second supreme effort to
                        enforce his “truth” on China—a truth which, being demonstrated in practice,
                        was eventually expected to be embraced by the world—with an assist, of
                        course, from “peoples' wars of liberation.”</p>
                    <p>In order to get back on its feet after the Great Leap, China had to shelve
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s extreme policies and adopt
                        the road of “revisionism,” skirting close to the heresy of private incentive
                        and reward. Not only was Maoism for a time quietly shelved, so was <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>—at least as much as his associates
                        dared and desired. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> later
                        complained of being treated like a deceased parent. He was trotted out at
                        times, for he had become the symbol of the new China's ancient uniqueness
                        and centrality—a concept of womb-like balm to the Chinese psyche. After all,
                        he was billed as the greatest living communist theoretician, in the direct
                            Marx-Lenin-Stalin-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> lineage
                        and the perfecter of “peoples' wars”—and this, with luck, meant that the
                        Chinese, appropriately, would in time inherit the earth by proxy.</p>
                    <p>But <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is not practiced in the art
                        of hiding his light under a bushel. He did not like being semi-shelved, nor
                        did he like what he saw of the bureaucratization of his revolution, the
                        growing apathy of the fattening cadres, and what he considered the recent
                        compromises throughout the nation with “spontaneous capitalistic
                        tendencies.” Accordingly he launched the Great Proletarian Cultural
                        Revolution, in the attempt to re-solidify his own power, and revive and
                        purify the revolution into something of its pristine vigor, to restore the
                        visionary romance of the Yenan cave days as a needed propellant to the
                        lagging revolution, and to temper the younger generation (who for the most
                        part had not experienced battle, Yenan austerity, or even, adequately, class
                        hatred) for its post-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        revolutionary responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> had become disillusioned with
                        the Party apparatus. Being charged with implementing policy at the local
                        level, the Party bureaucracy had learned to temper doctrinal purity with
                        practical realities, but to report the results, falsely, as constant with
                        the expectations of doctrinal purity. It was professionally healthier to do
                        so. This ruse was cumulative in its errors, and the day of reckoning had to
                        come. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> proceeded to wreck the
                        wayward Party with the Great Cultural Revolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s greatest opposition is human
                        nature itself, which he is trying to remake. This is one reason why he has
                        met instinctive opposition as he has successfully turned to each major
                        segment of Chinese society for support during the tortuous two years of his
                        Cultural Revolution. (His belief in the right thinking of the masses has
                        been naively total.) Yet his <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0688"/>utility as the national father image makes him almost indispensable at
                        this time in Chinese history—which partly explains why the opposition, so
                        far, has not solidified. The extremes of Maoism are instinctively opposed,
                        while <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is instinctively clung
                        to.</p>
                    <p>This genuine and terribly serious dilemma exacerbates already weighty,
                        political, economic and military policy differences in Peking. And a
                        suspicious, perhaps somewhat senile <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has so reduced his trusted circle of cronies during the
                        testiness of the Cultural Revolution that his prestigious minority has
                        barely been able to balance the fighting-for-their-lives bureaucratic
                        majority. This tug-of-war has insured that Peking speaks to the provinces
                        with vacillation, indecision and even contradiction. Such confusion has
                        generally resulted in inaction by the local agents of the central government
                        and has given opportunistic groups, from policy opponents to plain
                        hooligans, a breezy field day.</p>
                    <p>Forces long denied expression by Central Government unanimity and confidence
                        have now been unleashed by Peking's division and indecision, and all sorts
                        of repressed “bourgeois tendencies” are bursting out. These are furthered by
                        the bureaucratic opposition, by patriotic elements which feel they were
                        early deluded into support of a regime, the nature of which was
                        misrepresented, by disgruntled youth, by opportunistic workers and
                        peasantry, and by underprivileged elements of society who see advancement
                        only through lawless acts in a time of increasing disrespect for
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>The Party organization is discredited and its recently respected leadership
                        largely unseated—throughout the countryside, save for the one important
                        region of Sinkiang (nuclear installations and oil). Lower echelons are
                        uncertain of their mandate, confused by contradictory exhortations from
                        Peking, and affronted (earlier) by the license of the Red Guards and (more
                        lately) by encroachments of the military. Factional fighting (for both
                        ideological and pure power-grab reasons) and lawlessness are rampant.
                        Industrial productivity has been curtailed, agricultural productivity will
                        be seriously hampered for the coming year, and foreign trade jeopardized
                        through economic dislocations and political pig-headedness. The military
                        establishment is assigned jobs for which it is ill fitted: overseeing
                        factories, farms and railroads. But <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> apparently is reluctant to have the military intervene
                        to stop the factional fighting because it is one of his axioms that the
                        people and the army love and support each other, and always act in unison.
                        To admit that the country can only be ruled by the use of military force
                        would be to admit what increasingly seems to be the fact: things have gone
                        too far for <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> to reconsolidate his
                        power. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> The Symbol may be kept at
                        least as long as he lives, but Maoism, as he conceives it in his domestic

                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s “mandate of heaven” is
                        clearly slipping, it is too early to tell what will take its place. It may
                        take some time yet in coming, or the military may decide almost any time
                        that they have had enough of their country's coming apart, and impose a
                        crisper solution. Regional break-downs could prevail for a time, but are not
                        likely to be the pattern for long, because of the universal Chinese thirst
                        for reconstituted nationhood, and because China's economy is now
                        sufficiently sophisticated so that it depends upon a network of specialized
                        contributions from all parts of the country.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to know the true thinking of the Chinese people, because for
                        18 years there has not only been lack of freedom of speech, there has not
                        even been freedom to remain silent. All have had to be vocal in support of
                        the regime. It is just possible that the confusion and contradiction in
                        Peking is viewed by a great many Chinese as a welcome sign of collapse, and
                        that they want something quite different to follow. Surely many must be
                        disillusioned with unfulfilled promises of a decade ago; must be bone tired
                        of 18 years of overlapping mass campaigns—ideological flogging to increase
                        production at little or no personal gain; and must be wearied by receding
                        promises of restored Chinese primacy in the world. Too, the ridiculous
                        lengths to which <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has been made
                        an infallible god could at some point trigger the most destructive of
                        weapons: ridicule. A non-communist successor regime could thus become
                        conceivable, but it is unlikely. Most Chinese consider capitalism as the
                        only real alternative to communism, and the “capitalism” they knew in China
                        was most unattractive except for the few; it was highly exploitive, with
                        semi-colonial associations. The pragmatic communism of less Maoist periods
                        is probably viewed as not too bad in contrast.</p>
                    <p>Much more likely, therefore, is a military-bureaucratic collegium of
                        “communist” continuity, but less doctrinaire, increasingly adopting private
                        incentive methods, along with the trend in several other communist
                        countries. Domestically, the likely new management would be termed
                        relatively moderate. In time this may also apply to foreign relations, but
                        at first I should expect disappointingly little change there. Much will
                        depend upon the Chinese assessment of the future utility and promise of the
                        “peoples' war” concept. Much, that is, depends upon the outcome in Vietnam.
                        If later it should appear that the “imperialists” may be on the run through
                        even partial successes of several simultaneous peoples' wars (if they can be
                        ginned up) there may well be a temptation for China in a post-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> situation to paper over its
                        differences with the Soviet Union and cooperate somewhat more fully against
                        common enemies.</p>
                    <p>It is inconceivable, however, that the Sino-Soviet relationship will again be
                        anything like as close as in the early 50's. Several of the people purged in
                        the Cultural Revolution are believed to have been ousted because <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0690"/>they favored rapprochement with the Soviet
                        Union. If <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> loses out, these may
                        return to favor. I am not sure that a China in league with the Soviet Union
                        would necessarily be mellowed thereby. I think it might be that the Soviet
                        Union instead would be hardened. The Soviet Union seems to harden when it
                        feels strong, and to mellow only as a tactic of prudence when necessary.
                        Formerly, with a fast strengthening China on the loose, the Soviets even
                        came a bit closer to us. It may not be accidental that they have hardened
                        somewhat toward us, now that an estranged China has been weakened by the
                        Cultural Revolution. They might harden the more if China should become again
                        an ally, even a tenuous and uncomfortable one.</p>
                    <p>China under almost any auspices, if it is united and growing in strength,
                        will continue to present us, and its neighbors, with problems. It will
                        probably not rest until it has carved out in some fashion what it considers
                        to be its legitimate sphere of influence in Asia. Under a successor regime
                        to <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>, and in a situation of
                        something like power balance in Asia, that sphere might well be defined
                        within limits tolerable to us, depending upon how the “influence” were
                        exercised. But not as long as <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                        has his way. He is too committed to world revolution as a fundamental
                        article of faith, and too convinced that peoples' wars are the infallible
                        way to reach that objective.</p>

                        Intrusive central government is not the Chinese norm.</p>
                    <p>Both the communist dialectic and, seemingly, <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s own psychological make-up dictated that he use the
                        hate-object technique, to ensure political engagement of the populace. He
                        set about, from the very inception of his regime, to make the United States
                        serve the indispensable purpose of the hated devil. He has tried to forge
                        with us, paradoxically, even a sort of “inimical partnership” in the
                        interest of his revolution! This is not just a catch phrase. I believe it
                        accurately describes his conception of our utility to him, for both domestic
                        and foreign policy purposes, and that he and his regime (so long as it is
                        “his”) will not respond to any un-devilish overtures on our part. In dealing
                        with the Chinese Communists in Tientsin for nine months after they came to
                        power, in carrying on the negotiations in Geneva before they went to the
                        ambassadorial level, and in four years of advising in the Warsaw talks I
                        have seen scarcely a shred of evidence to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>So long as the true Maoists are in control, then I think we can take it for

                        home and devil hatred abroad.</p>
                    <p>Our occasional statements in the “ultimate reconciliation” vein, as
                        distinguished from tangible bridge-building offers, however, should be
                        continued—not too frequently, and in very measured tones. These are almost
                        certainly carefully registered in various Peking circles. For just as in
                        many ways China is our biggest headache, so we are certainly China's; it
                        follows that what we do or do not do, and say or do not say, is carefully
                        noted. Primarily our stand in Vietnam, but also our un-devilish statements
                        have surely helped sharpen policy debates in Peking, and it seems certain
                        that potential successor leadership is well aware of its policy options in
                        our regard, if it should wish to test them.</p>
                    <p>It would not seem to be the time quite yet for new bilateral initiatives with
                        China, or even for unilateral gestures toward China of the tangible
                        bridge-building sort. Not only would we be rebuffed, <hi rend="italic">but
                            China would have to go on record to that effect, and a successor regime
                            may well feel sufficient continuity with the present one so as to make
                            renunciation of that record awkward</hi>, though it might otherwise be
                        tempted to test us through response.</p>
                    <p>A better case, at least, could have been made for new initiatives prior to,
                        say, August 1966. Prior to that time Peking's leadership seemed unified and
                        the dislocations of the Cultural Revolution had not threatened the integrity
                        of the nation. Big global issues such as disarmament, non-proliferation and
                        the like seemed to call for efforts before very long to get China better
                        articulated into the world community, for the sake of ultimate world
                        stability. While these considerations as such are still valid, a China
                        weakened through turmoil lends somewhat less urgency, and the prospect of a
                        different China to come, possibly readier to respond, recommends the waiting
                        game. We can sympathize with the Chinese people in their turmoil and strife,
                        but from the standpoint of stark U.S. interests, and so long as China is
                        under present auspices, situations of less advantage to us than the present
                        one easily come to mind.</p>
                    <p>Our East Asian policies must in general be of a piece. Gestures of
                        magnanimity or friendship toward China in the face of the presently
                        necessary stand in Vietnam and Laos might be applauded in some European
                        capitals and on some American campuses, but not by our friends around the
                        periphery of China. Nor does the degree of promise in overtures to Peking at
                        present seem to warrant creating enormous problems for us on Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me, in short, that we have kept our future options open <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, rather than otherwise, by keeping relatively
                        quiet while mainland China is trying to sort itself out.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is something to be said for keeping our own ideological skirts
                        clean. The evils of the present Peking regime are sufficiently discernible
                        and documentable so that an attempt to cozy up to it—while <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0692"/>possibly serving other honorable purposes
                        if it worked—would be widely interpreted as a compromise of those things we
                        stand for, as well as the ditching of a rather satisfactory ally on Taiwan.
                        The Great Problem of Taiwan must mature further before it can be solved, and
                        an altered mainland may make it easier.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, we are doing other sorts of things which are very much a part of
                        China policy. We are attempting to thwart Chinese abetted and supported
                        aggression, and we are doing what we can to strengthen non-communist
                        Asia—very successfully in many instances. And we have made clear that we
                        would not be unresponsive to a China ready to deal on other than
                        paranoically one-sided terms.</p>
                    <p>Beyond that, it seems to me that the steps we can profitably take are
                        limited, until we can see the color of the China which is to emerge from the
                        present “curious, costly general election” on the mainland. Among those
                        limited steps, we might consider the following: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Perhaps we could afford to twist arms in New York with less
                                ferocity and anxiety on the Chinese Representation issue. We spend a
                                lot of blue chips on this issue. This is certainly no time to bring
                                China into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but I think there
                                is no danger of it. On his present tack of all-out peoples' wars, I
                                cannot imagine that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                                would accept the limiting implications of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership if it were offered, and it is not likely
                                to be offered to a Peking when everyone knows it is hard to define
                                just what constitutes Peking today—along with other reasons which
                                have been advanced all along against entry. Peking has said that the
                                UN is controlled by the imperialists, especially the United States,
                                and before it would be interested in membership the organization
                                must be reconstituted, and must withdraw the aggressor label (re
                                Korea) unjustly placed on China and place it where it belongs, on
                                the United States. I think we could put the monkey on Peking's back
                                for its self-imposed isolation, and get a lot of Europeans and
                                Afro-Asians off ours. We could not advocate Peking's entry, of
                                course, but we could relax more, in safety.</item>

                            <item>We might keep adequate China trade controls while removing the
                                opprobrious “trading with the enemy” label, and demonstrate
                                readiness for future flexibility by moving slightly from the total
                                embargo wicket. The “working level” at State is preparing a very
                                modest package which should be scrutinized when it is finished. Even
                                though it is modest, it may go a bit far for now. It seems to me we
                                should quietly move away from the principle of total embargo, both
                                because it is ineffective and because it smacks of former
                                black-and-white days in China policy, but we should not move to a
                                degree which may make any practical difference so long as the

                            <item>We should use the Warsaw talks more as an educational platform.
                                The record of the talks is read in a Peking leadership circle of
                                some indeterminate size. One of the dangerous things about present
                                Peking <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0693"/>leadership is the
                                almost unbelievable degree of its provincialism. We should find
                                excuses to weave into our prepared materials at Warsaw small
                                discourses about the nature of the open world partly already
                                arrived, partly just around the corner: the overlapping, global
                                patterns of social, economic and cultural organization constantly
                                spawned by continuing revolutions in communication, travel and
                                electronic wizardry; <hi rend="italic">the impossibility, today, of
                                    curtaining off a society if it expects to keep up with the

                                growth enable advancement in geometrical ratio, while even partially
                                isolated societies will grow in more nearly arithmetic ratio; the
                                total fund of human knowledge is now such that computer centers must
                                specialize more and more, and a country not geared into other
                                centers of learning is at an increasing disadvantage; etc., etc. We
                                cannot negotiate anything meaningful at Warsaw under present
                                conditions, but perhaps we can help worry the semi-mad Maoists into
                                an earlier cracking up, and give the potential successors something
                                to think about.</item>

                            <item>We have done well to refrain from public appraisal of the Cultural
                                Revolution. Its reality is embarrassing enough to the Chinese,
                                without advertisement. At some point when the watershed in China has
                                been passed long enough for the other side to show its character a
                                bit, a Presidential speech on China will probably be advisable.
                                Almost anything we say now will be turned against us by the present
                                regime, and the rec-ord of rejection will have grown. We should wait
                                until the present regime may be so discredited that its record in
                                its dying days will not really be pertinent.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>Basically, (and at the risk of speaking in broader terms than my assignment)
                        it seems to me we will help shape the new China as much by what we are as
                        what we do or do not do. Prestige kept carefully intact; quiet, abundant
                        power in the larger sense; credibility and integrity; and fidelity to those
                        fundamentals of the American heritage which made us strong in the first
                        place and in turn have guided, goaded, shamed and inspired people of many
                        other lands to revolutionary progress—these are the things which will be
                        negotiable assets, when the time comes, with that Chinese quarter of
                        humanity seeking a new national purpose and a new station in the world. It
                        is we who are associated with the real revolution going on in Asia, and
                        that, by and large, is the very best China policy open to us for this
                        transitional period. We need not be lacking in initiatives when the time
                        comes for them to pay off. That could be fairly soon, but no one can yet
                        tell.</p>

                                him particular concern. He said he had received from <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Intelligence Agents in Tibet
                                reports of serious internal difficulties, which would very likely be

                                closely, since in his judgment there was a possibility that some
                                dissident elements in Tibet might ask for assistance from India, in
                                the event that the Maoists tighten the pressures on Tibet even
                                further. If they do not get help, then the dissident elements would

                            <item>The Ambassador pointed out that the Indians with all their current
                                internal difficulties would probably be very loath to take any step
                                that might provoke the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s.
                                    <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> agreed that the Indians
                                would be reluctant. However, he felt that an opportunity might be
                                presented which should be exploited. He said he thought that British
                                Intelligence might have additional information about the situation
                                in Tibet. He suggested that the U.S. should intensify intelligence

                                <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> moved to the present serious
                                situation in Kwangtung province. He said this province seems to
                                contain more military elements that are anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> than most other areas, and it
                                is also the province in which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has the most underground agents. He said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans to intensify <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0695"/>its clandestine work there, and to
                                stage extensive anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                                activities in April and May, with particular emphasis on the Swatow
                                area. The Ambassador asked if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in fact had the capability to do this, and <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> replied he felt they did. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s efforts in Kwangtung are now scattered, with one
                                major area of activity at Nan-Hsiung (25–10N; 114–20E), near
                                    Ch'U-<persName>Chiang</persName> in the far north of the
                                province. He said he planned to “activate our people there.” He said
                                he would keep the Ambassador [<hi rend="italic">less than one line
                                    of source text not declassified</hi>] posted about progress and

                            <item>The Ambassador asked if <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>
                                foresaw any possibility that the activities would be so successful
                                that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might consider
                                them to constitute a provocative act by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said he had
                                perhaps not made himself clear; the activities would not be staged
                                in any way that could involve attribution to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and they would not be aimed at any
                                take-over of local power. His agents would simply stimulate and
                                participate in prevailing cultural revolution activities on the
                                    anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> side.</item>

                            <item>The Ambassador asked if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might not still blame the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> for instigating the troubles.
                                    <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> replied that he did not
                                believe this would happen. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> said
                                these activities would not be aimed at wresting political power for
                                the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the area, but rather at
                                increasing political instability and chaos. Kwangtung province had
                                been chosen simply because of a combination of agent assets and an
                                unstable situation. The objective would be to achieve increased
                                political instability in the area. He said Swatow appeared to be an
                                unstable area, and that Amoy had similar serious instabilities also.
                                He said that he wished to inform the Ambassador of the above “For
                                the Ambassador's reference.” <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>
                                then said that he knew the Ambassador was aware that last year the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had conducted some small
                                boat intelligence collection raids against the Mainland. He said
                                that, in line with his already expressed intention to avoid
                                provocative action in the present tense Far Eastern situation, “We
                                are suspending these raids now, and should we want to start them
                                again we will consult with you.”</item>

                                whether these aircraft were the same ones that apparently assembled
                                in Hsuchow last fall, or whether they are new aircraft recently

                                <persName corresp="#p_HAWJ1">Hummel</persName> on January 29 in

                                intention of his government, and the instructions by the Gimo, to
                                refrain from provocative acts against the Mainland, during the new
                                tensions in Vietnam and Korea. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>
                                reiterated that this was <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policy
                                and would be carried out, and he added that if there is anything the

                                to help, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would certainly

                                installation at Lung-Chi near Amoy, to try to discover whether they
                                are ground-to-air missiles, or whether they are ground-to-ground
                                missiles that could be a serious new threat to Quemoy.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> turned to the subject of
                                internal security, in the light of the Communist attacks on the U.S.
                                Embassy in Saigon and on President Park's residence in Seoul. He
                                thought that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had the
                                situation well under control in Taiwan, although the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has recently taken new actions to
                                prevent <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> infiltration. He
                                said that last year (presumably during calendar 1967) the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had discovered a total of 93
                                “cases” of attempted espionage. He said that this had been a
                                reduction from the previous year, but that it is obvious that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are still making
                                espionage attempts. During the past year, for instance, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had been trying to use
                                Mainland People who have sons in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Armed Forces by sending wives and other female
                                relatives from the Mainland to Hong Kong, and from there to Taiwan
                                for espionage purposes. The Ambassador suggested that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might also try to land small
                                groups of infiltrators along the Taiwan coast, as the North Koreans
                                have been doing in South Korea. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss>
                                said he thought this would be difficult but not impossible; he
                                thought the infiltration of dependents more likely.</item>

                    <p>I find no disagreement whatever among the first three papers in their
                        attempts to analyze the situation and the likely prospects for China. (Tab D
                        is almost entirely on policy.) It is natural in addressing a subject of this
                        extensiveness and complexity that the elements in the situation chosen to be
                        covered vary somewhat, but there is a surprising—and comforting—degree of
                        agreement among the three papers as to what is going on in China. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> paper is the most complete in this area,
                        but of course appropriately stops short of policy discussion. I think it
                        safe to say that there is general agreement that: <list>
                            <item>—China is in a mess, with widespread but mostly small-scale
                                factional fighting, with lawlessness, transportation stoppages, and
                                growing disrespect for authority resulting in significant damage to
                                industrial production and a threat to agricultural production

                    </p>
                    <p>All three papers dealing in policy considerations (Tabs A, C and D) believe
                        that we are unlikely to get appreciable reciprocation during the Maoist era
                        from any attempted rapproachment, although the academicians' paper appears
                        to be somewhat more hopeful than the other two in this regard. All three
                        papers, however, recommend certain steps to be taken unilaterally, where
                        reciprocation is not expected, designed to increase contact and to signal to
                        potential successors to the Maoists that they will have policy options in
                        our regard.</p>

                    <p>All three suggest liberalization of present trade regulations, but the
                        academicians would go farther than the other two papers. This rather complex
                        subject can perhaps best be reviewed after we receive State's more detailed
                        proposals. It may be useful to invite the academicians' comments, and
                        Congressional soundings will be important.</p>

                    <p>For some time we have been making efforts to no avail along the line
                        advocated by the academicians. There appears to be no quarrel with our

                    </p>
                    <p>In the attachment to the Secretary's memorandum the proposition is stated
                        that we should work gradually toward at least tacit acknowledg-ment that we
                        consider Peking and Taipei to represent two separate states. The other two
                        papers do not deal quite so explicitly with this subject, but this concept
                        seems to be implicit in both.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The academicians would have us make “determined efforts … to induce the
                        Republic of China to withdraw from the offshore islands (Quemoy and Matsu).”
                        The other two papers do not address this question. I feel that: <list>
                            <item>—for a while yet our efforts would be unavailing, and would deeply
                                trouble Taipei;</item>
                            <item>—with <persName>Chiang</persName>'s lessened emphasis on military
                                conquest of the mainland, this withdrawal is less important

                            <item>—meanwhile the status quo is crucially important to the legitimacy
                                of <persName>Chiang</persName>'s government at the national level:
                                without the islands the national and Taiwan provincial de facto
                                jurisdictions would be geographically coterminous.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary's attachment points out the ultimate desirability of getting
                        China associated in regional developmental projects. This was not mentioned
                        in the other two papers—perhaps because all would agree it is not
                        conceivable under present conditions—but is consonant with the general
                        approach of the other papers.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The academicians would have us engage in a broad bilateral discussion of all
                        the fundamental problems that lie between our two nations. <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0699"/>This is congenial to the two government
                        papers, not belabored in them doubtless because the authors knew we have
                        tried to do just that, and Peking is not interested.</p>

                        at the Chinese Communists' hardshell view of the world. The academicians
                        imply much the same thing. If the world is being gradually but willy-nilly
                        knit together both by the acids and the building blocks of modernity, this
                        surely brings both new dangers and new promise. Ignorance of the process
                        itself will increase the dangers, and the Chinese seem to be long on that
                        sort of ignorance. This will not be a bilateral discussion, but our own
                        stated observations which we hope would be usefully provocative.</p>

                    <p>This is one important subject on which there is a categorical difference of
                        opinion. The academicians would have us support Peking's seating in the
                        United Nations if it wishes to enter on the same terms as other countries.
                        The Secretary is emphatic in his opposition to Peking entry. <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> agrees that it is not in our
                        interest to have Peking under its present auspices in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but does not believe it would come in on the
                        same terms as other countries anyway—hence it is safe and seemly for us to
                        be somewhat more relaxed. Perhaps the trend is in that direction,
                        considering our stand on the study committee proposition.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">General Comment</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Except for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issue, there is a very large
                        area of general agreement in the memoranda. Of the three papers, the
                        academicians would have us go farthest toward attempted accommodation, and
                        rather promptly. <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> emphasizes
                        the importance of timing with regard to the assumed change-of-dynasty cycle,
                        especially in those steps wherein reciprocation would be at issue. I see
                        merit in our readying the Secretary's proposals—for another reading against
                        events on the trade package, which will take a bit of work around town. You
                        will presumably wish to get the views, too, of Defense, Commerce and
                        Agriculture.</p>

                    <p>Last March we recommended to you that restrictions on travel to mainland
                        China be continued in view of the unsettled political condition inside China
                        and the xenophobic behavior of the mobs of Red Guards which were at the time
                        committing excesses or threatening foreigners then resident in Peking and
                        elsewhere. The official announcement stated that travel was being restricted
                        “in view of the present unsettled conditions within mainland China and the
                        risks and dangers which might ensue from the inadvertent involvement of
                        American citizens in domestic disturbances.”</p>
                    <p>In the course of the last six months, the general political malaise in
                        Communist China has not eased; and its violent manifestations have <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0701"/>been widely evident in many
                        provinces. At the same time, (1) the regime has given evidence of an ability
                        to maintain order in the main cities to which foreigners have been permitted
                        to travel; (2) it has successfully managed a large trade fair in Canton in
                        November–December 1967 which was attended by thousands of foreigners; (3) it
                        has resumed admitting foreigners, such as the recent groups of Australian
                        and New Zealand students, who were conducted to a limited number of cities
                        with virtually no untoward incidents; and (4) it has exerted strong and
                        successful efforts to prevent a recurrence of the overt anti-foreign
                        demonstrations which marked the January–August period last year.</p>
                    <p>Peking continues to be sensitive, as do other communist states, to activities
                        by visitors, including technicians working in Communist China, which in
                        other countries might be considered totally innocent. Several of these,
                        including British and Japanese, have been detained under house arrest in the
                        last six to eight months. Peking also continues to exert pressure on the
                        British by holding a British newspaperman under house arrest and denying
                        members of the British mission in Peking permission to leave the country.
                        Individual British and other diplomats as well as most other foreign
                        residents in Peking, however, are in general being treated politely and are
                        free from serious harassment. We have no reason to believe that if American
                        citizens were issued visas they would be treated any differently in the
                        cities to which they would be permitted to go. The possibility can obviously
                        not be excluded that the Chinese might detain or arrest an American visitor
                        for innocent activities such as photographing in unauthorized areas or an
                        unintentional “insult.” While these hazards are, in certain respects,
                        similar to those confronting American travelers in the Soviet Union and
                        Eastern Europe, we recognize that they differ in degree. In the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and in Eastern Europe (apart from Albania
                        and Eastern Germany), the United States has diplomatic and consular
                        establishments able to attempt to protect such travelers, and the citizens
                        of those countries also travel in the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>On balance, however, we cannot say today—as we did a year ago—that there are
                        unusual “risks and dangers of inadvertent involvement of American citizens
                        in domestic disturbances.” Moreover, the standard set down in the only major
                        travel-control case we have won in recent years (Zemel v. Rusk) authorizes
                        restriction of travel “when it can be demonstrated that unlimited travel to
                        the area would directly and materially interfere with the safety and welfare
                        of … the nation as a whole.” We cannot fairly claim today that removal of
                        restrictions to mainland China would have the serious consequences
                        contemplated by the Zemel rule.</p>
                    <p>Our policy regarding passport validations for travel to Communist China is
                        now so liberal as to enable virtually any individual who has <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0702"/>some reason other than simple tourism for
                        traveling to qualify. This gradual and progressive liberalization of our
                        China travel restrictions (which contrasts sharply with the strict
                        limitations imposed on travel to Cuba, North Korea and North Viet-Nam) has
                        met with general approbation from the public and has been challenged by
                        virtually no one. It demonstrates that we do not really consider the risks
                        of American travel serious enough to outweigh the benefits of opening a wide
                        and mutually profitable range of peaceful contacts between the U.S. and
                        Communist China.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III.</p>
                    <p>There are two additional considerations relating to our general
                        travel-restriction policy which weigh in favor of removing the restriction
                        on travel to China: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The recent court decision in the Straughton Lynd case—which the
                                Department of Justice has refused to take to the Supreme
                                Court—virtually eliminates all our enforcement power in the
                                travel-control area. American citizens are now free to go to North
                                Viet-Nam, North Korea, Cuba and China, if they can get in, so long
                                as they do not use their passports in doing so. All that stands
                                behind our passport limitation is moral and patriotic suasion, and
                                the effect of that obviously diminishes the more thinly it is
                                spread. We would be best advised, therefore, to concentrate our
                                exhortation to American citizens on countries or areas such as North
                                Viet-Nam or North Korea—where we have vital interests in restraining
                                travel—and not fritter it away on China.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The same considerations affect the travel-control legislation we
                                have sent to Congress. We have heard from the Hill that Congressmen
                                and Senators are concerned that the proposed bill grants excessively
                                broad authority to the Secretary of State. The best refutation of
                                that claim is to demonstrate that even when our authority is
                                entirely unlimited by statute—as it is now—we have exercised great
                                self-discipline in imposing travel restrictions.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                    <p>The practical consequences of removing the restriction will probably be
                        minimal. Peking has generally refused to permit American citizens with
                        validated passports to visit its territory, and we do not anticipate that it
                        will immediately change its position. It has, of course, allowed in those
                        American citizens—such as Robert Williams and other extremists—whom it
                        favors. Eliminating the restriction will not, we believe, substantially
                        increase this traffic because all those who were invited were able and
                        usually willing to visit China without State Department authorization. And
                        in light of the Lynd case, they all now have the legal right to go.</p>
                    <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0703"/>
                    <p>A disadvantage of dropping restrictions altogether is that we will no longer
                        have a clear record of those individuals who have indicated their interest
                        in travel to mainland China. We doubt that this is a serious problem,
                        however, and believe that any individual who would have applied for a
                        validated passport will let it be known he is going to the mainland if he
                        actually receives a Chinese visa. Those individuals, on the other hand, who
                        would earlier not have wished their passage to the mainland to become known
                        and would have traveled clandestinely may continue to do so.</p>

                    <p>Our justification for limiting travel last year was couched in terms which

                    <p>Attached is the most thoughtful paper on the vexing Taiwan problem which I
                        have seen in some time.<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">The paper, entitled
                            “U.S. Policy Toward the Republic of China: A New Perspective,” drafted
                            by <persName corresp="#p_STP1">Shoesmith</persName> on March 27, is not
                            printed.</note> It was prepared by Tom Shoesmith to serve as the basis
                        for the discussion of Taiwan which consumed most of the second day of the
                        two-day China Panel sessions. I recommend it in toto.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_STP1">Shoesmith</persName>'s basic thesis is that the
                        “Taiwanization” of Taiwan is proceeding slowly but surely, and that this
                        trend is in the U.S. interest. We need not indicate overtly that the U.S.
                        foresees the possibility of an eventually independent Taiwan, and certainly
                        our defense commitments should remain intact. At the same time, we should
                        take steps 1) to encourage a reduced military burden for the Island, 2) to
                        further its economic progress, and 3) to prompt an increased role in
                        regional economic and political affairs. He advocates a more relaxed
                        acceptance of <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> trends in the United
                        Nations, although for the foreseeable future our own policy should not
                        change. (He believes that most of the considerations <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0707"/>arguing for no change in our own <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss> policy are likely to figure in the
                        decisions of the majority of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members—at
                        least pending changes on the mainland and in Taiwan which might then, in
                        fact, cause us to accept with equanimity some form of a “two Chinas” or “one
                        China, one Taiwan” proposal.)</p>
                    <p>I am in general agreement with this paper, as were practically all of the
                        participants in the Panel, with the notable exception of George Taylor.
                        Lucian Pye and Paul Varg expressed some relatively minor reservations.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned in staff meeting that there was overwhelming belief in the Panel
                        that Taiwan was inexorably becoming more Taiwanized and many, most notably
                        John Fairbank, believed that ultimate independence was the most likely
                        prospect as trends could now be judged. (I have asked <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for a modest study of this trend.) In
                        addition, there are increasing indications that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> has reassessed his own role in history, that
                        he has possibly accepted the unlikelihood of his return to the mainland
                        (although he can never say so), and that he is turning his energies toward
                        showing how Chinese can come to grips with the 20th Century in a way in
                        which he realized he could not have shown on the mainland.</p>
                    <p>While I believe most of the thinking in this paper to be realistic, I hope
                        the “liberals” on this subject will not seize upon its long-term
                        implications in order to “erase the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        fiction” prematurely. In any event, we certainly should not take any moves
                        with respect to Taiwan in the hopes of improving thereby our relations with
                        the mainland. Present Peking leadership clearly does not consider that it is
                        in Peking's interest to improve relations with the United States. When the
                        time comes for a mainland leadership's advocacy of, or acquiescence in,
                        improved relations, it is my contention that Taiwan and our commitments
                        there may well not stand seriously in the way.</p>
                    <p>Taiwan is growing in its own strength in almost every way, but it is not yet
                        strong enough or independent enough to weather safely an overt shift in U.S.
                        policy. The death of <persName>Chiang</persName> or an economic setback, for
                        instance, could cause to emerge power rivalries, policy differences and
                        mainlander-Taiwanese animosities which could seriously weaken the polity,
                        which will be fairly vulnerable for some time to come. We can perhaps keep
                        long-term probabilities for Taiwan better in mind than we have so far. And
                        we can take certain practical steps, such as the tailoring of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in the hopes of shaping the military
                        establishment to accord with its likely future role. (It is interesting to
                        speculate on the possibly increased utility for purposes of regional reserve
                        forces of an ultimate Taiwan military establishment as distinguished from a
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military establishment.)</p>
                    <p>Above all we should remember that the whole mainland-Taiwan China tangle is
                        not just a U.S. problem, but is one for the world, and particularly <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0708"/>for our Asian friends. Our past
                        policies, basically justifiable as you know I have considered them, have
                        rather tended to convince the world that the China problem is pretty much a
                        U.S. problem. The ultimate fate of Taiwan will depend not so much on what we
                        do or do not do (short of scrapping our defense commitment) although our
                        policy will certainly remain a major factor. Taiwan's fate will at least as
                        much depend on what happens on the mainland and what course is taken on
                        Taiwan—primarily by <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                        Ching-kuo</persName>—after the Gimo's death. Whether Ching-kuo then opts for
                        a relatively popular base for government or looks to military support for a
                        “tight little island” will in turn have considerable effect upon U.S. policy
                        toward Taiwan.</p>

                            unusual <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> reaction. In late
                            February and early March <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> shore
                            batteries on the Offshore Islands on several occasions fired on a number
                            of small high-speed targets, with no hits reported. In view of the fact
                            that none of these “targets” was visually sighted, it is likely that
                            they were radar “ghosts” or clutter. The <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> later admitted that they (<gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>) considered them to be products of “seasonal
                            meteorological anomalies”, since much the same type of activity occurred
                            during the same period in 1967. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>

                        <item>After more than a year of quiescence, the problem of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> irregulars in the tri-border area has
                            taken a new tack. Recent offers by the Thais and Burmese to the
                            irregulars to serve against Communist insurgents have spurred the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> into action. We know privately that
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> planning is underway to unify
                            the various irregular groups to form an effective anti-Communist force
                            in Burma under <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> control. Initially,
                            only money and equipment would be supplied by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, but the planners envisage a time when
                            men would be sent to help the irregulars, at least during some
                            operations. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials feel that this
                            plan would offer least political difficulty for the present and would be
                            flexible enough for future contingency use of the irregulars. Actual
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> implementation of these plans
                            would represent a marked shift from assurances previously given the

                    <p>On May 18, 1968, the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw invited an officer from the
                        U.S. Embassy to the Chinese Embassy and handed him a letter from Charge
                        Ch'en Tung to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>
                        stating that since Ambassador <persName>Wang</persName> would not be able to
                        return to Warsaw by May 29, the scheduled time of the next meeting, and “as
                        there is nothing to discuss at present,” the Chinese Government suggested
                        that the 135th meeting be postponed until mid or late November. (Telegram

                        <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">CHICOM</gloss>-US) Telegram 167426 to Warsaw, May
                        20, transmitted the text of a letter to be conveyed to Ch'en in reply. The
                        letter stated that the U.S. side continued to feel the talks were of value,
                        that it was prepared to meet again with Ch'en on May 29 as an interim
                        measure until Ambassador <persName>Wang</persName> was able to return, and
                        that there were “several pressing matters we would wish to take up on this
                        occasion.” It urged adhering to the originally scheduled date. Telegram 3241
                        from Warsaw, May 21, reported that the letter had been delivered that
                        morning. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On May 24, at another meeting at the Chinese Embassy, Chinese Attaché Lo
                        returned the U.S. letter of May 21. He read a prepared statement declaring
                        that it could not be accepted because it addressed Ch'en Tung as the Charge
                        d'Affaires of the Office of the Chinese Representative <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0711"/>to the U.S.-Chinese Ambassadorial Talks
                        rather than as the Charge d'Af-faires of the Chinese People's Republic in
                        Poland. <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>, who had been
                        absent at the time the May 21 letter was sent, suggested to the Department
                        that the letter should be addressed to Ch'en Tung, Chargé d'Affaires,
                        Embassy of the People's Republic of China, Warsaw, the form of address used
                        in a letter of March 6. (Telegram 3293 from Warsaw, May 24; ibid.) Telegram
                        170093 to Warsaw, May 24, concurred, and telegram 3309 from Warsaw of the
                        same date reported that the letter had been handed to Lo that day, along
                        with another stating that <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>
                        would soon be leaving Warsaw, leaving Deputy Chief of Mission Walter E.
                        Jenkins, Jr., as Charge d'Affaires. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On May 28, at the Chinese Embassy, Lo conveyed a letter from Ch'en Tung to
                            <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> stating that U.S.
                        arguments for holding the meeting as scheduled were “untenable.” It stated
                        that the U.S. Government had recently “stepped up its military provocations
                        and war threats against the Chinese people” while making “various gestures
                        of sham relaxation to hoodwink the people of the world” and that under the
                        circumstances, there was no point in holding the meeting. (Telegram 3335
                        from Warsaw, May 28; ibid.) Telegram 171995 to Warsaw, May 28, 1968,
                        instructed the Embassy to express orally strong regret at the tone of the
                        Chinese letter and to reject as baseless the allegations made in it,
                        emphasizing that the meetings were not a “gesture” nor were they designed to
                        “produce a good effect” but to deal privately with problems between the two
                        countries. In addition, the Embassy was to convey a written response
                        proposing a meeting on June 26 or July 10. (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> reported in telegram 3364 from
                        Warsaw, May 28, that the Embassy had done so. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On June 27, at the Chinese Embassy, Lo transmitted a letter from Ch'en to
                            <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> insisting that the
                        meeting be postponed until mid or late November. (Telegram 3745 from Warsaw,

                            by the Central Intelligence Agency, the intelligence organizations of

                            All members of the U.S. Intelligence Board concurred in the estimate on

                            Hughes, filed with the source text, states that the estimate was the
                            product of very lengthy discussions reflecting a long-standing
                            disagreement within the Intelligence Community over the nature of the
                            relationships among the top Chinese leaders. The key question, according
                            to Greene, was whether <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao

                        <item>The situation inside Communist China is still highly fluid and the
                            outlook uncertain. Disorder, confusion, and unrest continue but have
                            been reduced since the high water mark last summer. Nevertheless, the
                            ranks of those alienated by the Greater Proletarian Cultural Revolution
                            have grown; the costs in political control, social discipline, and
                            economic progress have far outweighed the gains. Though <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> was successful in breaking
                            high-level opposition in the old party apparatus, in its broader aspects
                            his Cultural Revolution has been a failure and we believe it will be
                            gradually phased out.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> still appears to be the
                            central figure and source of basic policy. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and the regime are officially committed to the
                            reconstruction of a new framework for administrative and political
                            control. On balance, we believe that the trend will be toward regaining
                            some stability, in part because of the increased influence of the
                            moderate elements in Peking. But there still will be sharp twists and
                            turns, occasional crises, and disorder and turmoil at various levels
                            which will reflect strong differences among factions and leaders over
                            policies and tactics.</item>

                        <item>The military will remain Peking's most reliable instrument over the
                            coming year. As the only cohesive force with a nationwide system of
                            command and control, the military will have to serve a variety of
                            administrative <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0713"/>and control
                            functions. The scope of the rebuilding effort—political, economic, and
                            social—may require the heavy support of the People's Liberation Army
                                (<gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>) for some years to come.
                            Military dominance in political life may become institutionalized,
                            particularly if political reconstruction bogs down in violence and
                            disarray requiring the repressive force of the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>. The corollary to this increased political role is the
                            diversion of the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> from normal
                            military routine and a consequent reduction in its military

                        <item>The damage to the economy as a direct result of the Cultural
                            Revolution includes depressed industrial production, a delay in
                            modernization and economic growth, aggravated labor problems, setbacks
                            in the training of technical specialists, and a general hiatus in the
                            formulation of new economic policies and plans. The cumulative damage to
                            the economy of prolonged political turmoil will not be easily or quickly
                            repaired. Whatever the political course for 1968, agricultural output is
                            not likely to repeat last year's very good harvests, which benefited
                            from exceptionally good weather. At best, China can hope only to restore
                            stability and balance to the economy in 1968, foregoing any prospect of
                            expansion. Indeed, there is a possibility that a reduction in food
                            output, combined with problems of collection and distribution, could
                            cause a serious food shortage by 1969, which in turn could have serious
                            political repercussions.</item>

                        <item>“Red Guard diplomacy” cost Peking last year in relations with
                            Communist as well as non-Communist regimes. Since last summer, however,
                            the regime has taken steps to reduce the violent and provocative
                            influence of internal affairs on foreign relations. In the main, the
                            Cultural Revolution has not altered the general line of Chinese policy
                            abroad; it still remains revolutionary in tone but cautious and prudent
                            in deeds. Preoccupation with internal affairs is likely to relegate
                            foreign concerns to a secondary role.</item>

                            <p>A trade package, concerning which I have talked at length with Bob
                                Barnett for many months, is in abeyance largely because of reaction
                                of peripheral friendly countries to the President's March 31
                                statement and the Paris talks (i.e., fears that we are becoming soft
                                on communism). As you know, I believe there are a few limited steps
                                in the trade field which we could and should take any time
                                now—especially with the Paris developments. If there should come a
                                Vietnam settlement and either one of the two likely outcomes of the
                                Cultural Revolution, I think we might want to attempt a bit more.
                                Doing so must assume prior groundwork. Dana Robinson (correspondence
                                at Tab B) has been doing some useful work with the academic
                                community, the business community and to some extent the Hill with
                                respect to China trade, largely in the post-Vietnam context. I think
                                he has used very good judgment and has been working in our long-term
                                interest. He has kept me well informed. I am sorry to hear that he
                                has met with such negative response that he is giving up his
                                efforts. We are effectively denying the Chinese Communists almost
                                nothing because of our trade restrictions. Of course we should
                                continue to make it hard for them to get certain things, but Western
                                Europe and Japan as well as European communist countries are in
                                general all too ready to fill the breach. I am convinced that Japan
                                especially will increase its lenient ways.</p>
                            <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0715"/>
                            <p>There have been several signs that the Chinese Communists are
                                regularizing their international relations and attempting to repair
                                the damage of Red Guard diplomacy. It is too soon to speak in terms
                                of a revival of the “Bandung spirit” in Chinese Communist politics,
                                but something of the sort could well come and make it very hard for
                                us to deal with others' lessened restrictions on China whether it be
                                concerning trade or <gloss target="#t_ChiRep1">ChiRep</gloss>.
                                Meanwhile, it is difficult in most people's view, I believe, to
                                square the extreme restrictions in our trade policy with our desire
                                for more contact and a freer flow of people, ideas and goods. We
                                would, of course, get no response from Peking as yet, but I do
                                believe that the limited steps proposed in <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName>'s package might well hasten
                                the day when we would be able to take bigger steps in safety and
                                with profit.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName> June 7 to discuss
                            with him US concern over implications of possible Canadian initiatives

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that the Secretary had asked him
                            in low-key way to run through points of concern to the United States and
                            proposed therefore to mention the various problems we see as Canada
                            moves to possible recognition Communist China, as suggested by Prime
                            Minister's policy statement on Canadian foreign policy and other remarks
                            by Prime Minister and Mr. <persName>Sharp</persName>. We have noted, of
                            course, Mr. <persName>Sharp</persName>'s references <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0716"/>to taking into account the Government

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that the first problem that we see
                            is the pattern exemplified in French experience with recognition of
                            Peking. At that time Peking made it totally clear to Paris that a
                            continued relationship with Taipei was out of the question. Taipei,
                            primarily for reasons of face, actually broke relations with France but
                            did this only after being informed by French that with the arrival of
                            Chinese Communist Mission their Embassy in Paris would lose its “raison
                            d'etre.“ Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> gave the Ambassador copy of a
                            chronology encompassing US understanding of what transpired in course of
                            French recognition of Peking.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Primary concern to US is the status of Taipei. It is doing a very good
                            job, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said, and juridically, morally, and
                            in regional terms it is a going concern and important to Free World
                            position.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that it might be of interest to
                            Canadian Government that we have been confidentially informed by French
                            that in view of recent anti-French statements by Communist China, they
                            are seriously considering not returning their Ambassador to Peking. He
                            mentioned this, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said, to indicate roller
                            coaster nature of relationship with Chinese Communists.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>A secondary but important point involved the timing of possible
                            Canadian initiatives. This was involved with the Viet-Nam situation and
                            Paris talks. Such an initiative by the Canadians would give
                            encouragement to hard liners, both within Communist China itself and in
                            Hanoi, and this might well rub off on North Vietnamese position in the
                            Paris talks. The degree of damage to be anticipated here obviously
                            depended on the terms on which the Canadians dealt with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> said that another important factor which
                            again depended on these terms was the blow which Taipei would suffer and
                            which might be increased if other countries were tempted to follow the
                            Canadian example. There would be concern, particularly in East Asia,
                            both over the blow to Taipei and over the increased prestige which
                            Peking would gain from Canadian action.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said he wanted to
                            indicate to Canadian Government our sense of concern, a concern based in
                            large part on what happened when the French began a similar initiative.
                            Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> referred to Mr.
                                <persName>Sharp</persName>'s conversation with the Secretary and
                            reiterated our hope that the Canadians would talk to us before they took
                            any action vis-#-vis Communist China.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>In response, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Ritchie</persName>
                            said that he would report points made by Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            and the concern which he expressed. He would like to say, however, that
                            he did not believe that the parallel with France was necessarily
                            applicable to Canada. In a very real sense, he believed that Mr.
                                <persName>Sharp</persName> felt that Canada could only find out what
                            the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0717"/>would have in mind by trying. He
                            questioned the effect such an initiative would have on the Paris talks,
                            but agreed that extent this influence would be governed by terms of
                            Canadian initiative. He concluded by stating it goes without saying that

                        <item>At President <persName>Chiang</persName>'s request I called on him at
                            his Yangmingshan residence June 25. Gimo's purpose was to convey his
                            deep concern about implications June 22 New York Times editorial on
                            China policy, and developing trend as he saw it of U.S. thinking on
                            China issues. In particular he was disturbed about editorial's assertion
                            that USG considering urging President <persName>Chiang</persName> to
                            withdraw <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces from Offshore
                            Islands. Gimo said this type of statement, together with Anderson
                            article, could encourage Chinese Communists to attack Offshores. He
                            urged <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to issue statement repudiating
                            editorial's insinuation that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                            considering urging a withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            from Quemoy and Matsu.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>In conversation which lasted nearly two hours Gimo dwelt on what he
                            interpreted as alarming trends U.S. policy and public attitudes towards
                            China. He cited editorial's mention of Leonard Marks speech in early May
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> May 22 speech<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">Reference is to a speech on China by Under

                            February on alleged high level <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            discussions of China policy matters. He said he was particularly
                            incensed by last <gloss target="#t_para1">para</gloss> NY Times
                            editorial which advocated withdrawal U.S. opposition to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0718"/>entry to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and initiation of steps to recognize Peking as seat of
                            government for mainland China. Editorial stated: “This does not mean
                            abandoning Taiwan, but does involve recognizing Taipei for what it
                            is—and what it is not.” Gimo said editorial is insulting and has aroused
                            strongest resentment among Chinese people. He reasoned some of contents
                                <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> editorial also reflected views some
                            influential <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials. He said
                            editorials such as this make Chinese have serious doubts about U.S.
                            policy towards China and Chinese cannot help but resent what U.S. is
                            doing. He bluntly asked what was more in interests of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>—encouragement of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> regime or friendly relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>?</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>President stressed repeatedly that Quemoy and Matsu were integral part
                            of China and could not be separated from territory of China. He said
                            retention of Quemoy and Matsu were absolutely imperative for defense of
                            Taiwan and Pescadores and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would
                            fight to last man to defend Offshores. If Quemoy and Matsu were lost, he
                            thought it was questionable whether Taiwan and Pescadores could be
                            successfully defended even with U.S. air and naval power. Gimo said if
                            U.S. should adopt views attributed to U.S. officials in Anderson article
                            and give up defense of the Offshores, this would have extremely bad
                            effect on morale, would incite <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            attack on Offshores, would give <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s momentum required for successful attack on Taiwan,
                            and would have lasting effects even more serious than Vietnam war. In
                            addition, hardliners in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would be
                            encouraged to stiffen position at Paris Peace Talks and to intensify
                            war.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>President <persName>Chiang</persName> urged U.S. to clarify once and
                            for all its basic position towards status of Offshores. Gimo repeatedly
                            returned to this theme and urged that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for its own interests and for interests security in
                            Asia should openly state that NY Times editorial has no foundation in
                            fact and is completely groundless. He stated “for the sake of China and
                            the U.S. and our mutual interests the insinuations contained in the NY
                            Times editorial must be denied by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                            Only by doing this can damage already caused by editorial and Anderson
                            articles be minimized.” Gimo added that not only had NY Times editorial
                            caused considerable concern here but many leading members of U.S.
                            Congress had made appeasing statements concerning Communist China. This
                            was why he thought it important for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            to make concise, resolute statement clarifying U.S. position toward
                            Offshores along lines that Offshores are integral part of territory of
                            Republic of China and U.S. Government has no right to determine their
                            disposition. He referred with warm approbation to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement concerning Taiwan<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">Reference is to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s remarks at a press conference
                                on June 21; for text, see ibid., July 8, 1968, pp. 33–38.</note>
                            which was along similar lines and <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0719"/>said there was even more reason for U.S. to make such a
                            statement about Offshores since they were undisputed Chinese territory
                            long before Taiwan was retroceded at end of World War II.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>President warned that if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not
                            come out with such a statement he seriously estimated that Communist
                            China would be likely to launch an attack on the Offshore Islands
                            between now and inauguration new U.S. President. He felt Peking would
                            misinterpret <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> editorial, Anderson
                            articles, and other official statements. Partly for internal reasons—to
                            draw dissident factions together, and partly because apparent weakness
                            or at least uncertainty U.S. posture—<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would think they had golden opportunity to attach
                            Offshores. Gimo then added that speaking as a friend, present U.S.
                            attitude towards Viet Cong, <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, and
                            Communist China appeared to Asian people as reminiscent of the attitude
                            Chamberlain had adopted toward Nazi Germany prior WW II. He dwelt on
                            this point at some length. He then said he believed if U.S. continues
                            with present irresolute attitudes it would lead to World War Three,
                            since Communist China will be encouraged to pursue more aggressive
                            designs.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I told the President I appreciated his willingness to give frank
                            expression to his views and I respected the depth of his convictions. I
                            then said that I felt he was giving too much weight to both the NY Times
                            editorial and the Anderson articles, that neither had any standing as
                            far as U.S. Government is concerned. Repeated that <hi rend="italic">NY
                                Times</hi> editorials, like all other expressions of our free press,
                            represented private views of newspaper and not official <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy or positions. I said that I felt
                            editorial was regrettable but it was nothing new for him and many others
                            to read unpalatable views in <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> or indeed
                            in other papers. I told <gloss target="#t_Pres1">Pres</gloss> that as he
                            knew there were various shades of opinion in U.S. concerning China but,
                            the administration supported by the Congress, was steadfast on basic
                            policy as it now stands.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I then mentioned that Gimo knew we had not approached his government
                            to suggest evacuation Quemoy or Matsu. I told him that there were
                            officials at lower levels in the U.S. Government who constantly write
                            background papers and think pieces embodying a great variety of views on
                            various contingency situations, but these papers do not constitute
                            policy. I said that there should be no concern because at the policy
                            making levels of the government our policy towards China was well
                            established. The expressions of editorial opinion published in our
                            leading newspapers may have some influence but they do not necessarily
                            represent any majority opinion. I told the President that in his own
                            experience through the years he has been able to put up with a great
                            deal of press commentary of this type. I expressed hope that President
                            could continue to live with expressed views that were contrary to <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>'s policy. I said that Washington was
                            inclined to believe it was not useful in general <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0720"/>for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            to refute or even take cognizance of questionable editorials on foreign
                            policy issues. It would be a confusing and unprofitable business and
                            would draw added attention to these editorials. I said I doubted if it
                            would be possible to have a rebuttal statement issued such as the
                            President desired, but I would transmit his request to Washington
                            without delay.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I referred to his remarks on appeasement and stated that it pained me
                            very much, with our very high casualty rate in Vietnam and with our
                            heavy additional defense burdens in Korea, in Western Europe and
                            elsewhere in the world, to hear the President intimate that the United
                            States is pursuing a Chamberlain type appeasement policy. I told the
                            President that when we are making such heavy sacrifices in the cause of
                            freedom and standing firm on all the cardinal principles of freedom we
                            are defending, any characterization of “appeasement” was inappropriate
                            and could not be justified.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I then referred to various speeches that have been made by top-level
                            U.S. officials holding out the possibility of additional contacts with
                            mainland China. I told the President that those who were advocating
                            seeking limited contacts are not thinking in terms of formal diplomatic
                            relations or enhancement of the international position of Communist
                            China. Rather they were thinking in terms of establishing a better
                            understanding with the Chinese people on the mainland, his people. I
                            said there is a fairly widespread desire in the U.S. for cultural,
                            intellectual, medical and press contacts with the people of the
                            mainland. This however was not equivalent to the advocacy of formal
                            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> Government
                            nor the acceptance or condoning of the Chinese Communist regime or its
                            policies. I suggested that over the long run such people-to-people
                            contacts, if they could be brought about, might provide some means of
                            offsetting the dangerous spread of poisonous anti-U.S. feeling and
                            misunderstanding fomented by the Communists in a whole new generation on
                            the mainland.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>Since the Wuhan episode of last summer, the conservatives in general have had
                        their way more—often with Army collusion or acquiescence. This has concerned
                        the Maoists, and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> on June 2
                        issued one of his infrequent delphic “instructions” to the effect that the
                        masses were to be given their rein at all costs. This has resulted, not
                        unexpectedly, in a rise in fighting throughout June. The level has not yet
                        reached that of last summer, but it is well on the way, and we have again a
                        situation which could deteriorate fairly rapidly.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the chief difference between last summer and now is that Cultural
                        Revolution dislocations have begun to bring suffering to larger and larger
                        numbers of citizens. Illegal immigrants into Hong Kong give most frequently
                        as reasons for fleeing, unemployment and food shortages. Lack of raw
                        materials, labor troubles and not infrequently sabotage have reduced
                        production in many enterprises to the point where salaries cannot be met. We
                        have reports of both grave robberies (especially in rur-al areas, valuables
                        are still often buried with the dead) and the sale of children—both typical
                        phenomena in times of crisis in China. (One woman spoke of being offered the
                        equivalent of about $45.00 for her son, but she was holding out for more.)
                        Vehicles, even public buses, are being stolen for use in factional fighting,
                        and bicycles are at such a premium in some places where public
                        transportation has ceased to function, that they are being wrested out from
                        under the riders.</p>
                    <p>Serious floods are reported from six provinces in Southeast China. The early
                        rice crop in Kwangtung may be off as much as 10–15%, and planting of late
                        rice will be delayed.</p>
                    <p>All three North-South rail lines have had interruptions for considerable
                        periods in June from floods, landslides and fighting around the stations.
                        (We are not sure whether military-manned priority trains are getting
                        through, where “acts of God” are not the cause of the interruptions.) Many
                        letters mention that the writer is stranded away from home or work because
                        of lack of transportation.</p>
                    <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0722"/>
                    <p>No one knows what all this will ultimately mean, of course. However, one is
                        now tempted to alter the British witticism of last fall to the effect “the
                        situation is excellent, but not hopeless.” Things must be beginning to look
                        pretty hopeless to the average Chinese. If the regime could bring itself to
                        give the conservatives their way, things could quiet down, but there are no
                        signs that the regime will do that. Almost anything could happen in coming
                        months, but the best bet still is that a portion of the military will get
                        fed up and take matters into their own hands. If the Maoists' opposition
                        should begin to jell, we should see radio stations taken over. So far, this
                        has happened in only a couple of places very temporarily some months ago. It
                        was premature.</p>

                            June 22. His analysis is that the Communists may be emboldened to strike

                            conduct of our relations here that low-key statement be made by the
                            Department's spokesman that would help to assuage <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fears about the Anderson articles and
                            the NY Times editorial statement about Offshores. Such a statement could
                            easily avoid any confusion of our clear position as to exclusion of
                            Offshores from treaty area. To be effective for these purposes, I
                            believe a statement would need to be public. It could take the form of a
                            simple response to an arranged question that those islands are Chinese
                            territory and their fate is not ours to dictate.</item>

                        <item>We have considered carefully your suggestion Ref B for some statement
                            which would be responsive to President <persName>Chiang</persName>'s
                            request as outlined Ref A. As you made clear to

                            Anderson series or editorials taking various positions on China policy.
                            At time Anderson articles appeared, Department spokesman set forth our
                            position as clearly as possible (State 133316 and 135413).<note n="5" xml:id="d318fn5">Telegrams 133316 and 135413 to Taipei, March 20 and

                            with respect to our overtures toward Communist China would risk making
                            Offshore Islands and China policy issues subject of partisan controversy
                            with consequences that might be even more disturbing to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> than events which have prompted

                        <item>Begin message. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> has reported in detail the observations which
                            you were good enough to make to him on June 25. I appreciate, as always,
                            a frank exposition of your views and I have given them the most careful
                            thought and attention. I hope that you will continue to meet with our
                            Ambassador from time to time for such frank discussions on matters of
                            mutual interest and concern.</item>

                        <item>I have noted your anxiety concerning certain speculative articles and
                            editorials concerning U.S. policy and wish to share with you my own
                            thoughts on the questions you raised about their significance and
                            impact. The Department of State has for many years indicated that the
                            position of the United States Government concerning the offshore islands
                            is that expressed specifically and solely in the Mutual Defense Treaty
                            of 1954 and the Joint Congressional Resolution of 1955. That remains our
                            position. With respect to the limited conversations which we have had
                            with the authorities of Mainland China, we have repeatedly made clear
                            that such conversations in no way imply any change in our commitments to
                            or any diminution of our concern for the Republic of China and
                            Taiwan.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The speculative articles and editorials which you brought to the
                            Ambassador's attention in no way qualify the position of the United
                            States Government. They attracted no significant attention in the United
                            States and I have seen no public discussion here arising from them. I do
                            not believe, therefore, that any useful purpose would be served by
                            taking public issue with such press comments, beyond that which has
                            already occurred. Quite frankly, it would not be in the interest of
                            either of our countries to contribute to a controversial discussion on a
                            matter which is not being actively debated at the present time.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I also have noted your concern that such speculation may encourage
                            Chinese Communists to launch an attack on offshores and your estimate
                            that such an attack may be imminent. We are of course alert to
                            possibility that Chinese Communists may attempt to renew tensions in
                            Taiwan Strait, and we are especially appreciative of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> care to avoid provoking such action. We
                            have no indications from other sources, however, that Chinese Communists
                            intend provoke incident in Strait or are planning such moves. We will
                            continue to keep this matter under closest scrutiny and would appreciate
                            any intelligence information <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> may
                            develop.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Since we are very anxious that you always feel free to be frank with
                            us, I hope that you will understand frankness on our part as well. I
                            found it difficult to understand your assessment of the reaction of
                            people in Asia to U.S. policies in Vietnam and toward Communist China.
                            The American people have accepted almost 300,000 casualties since the
                            end of World War II in trying to assist our friends in maintaining their
                            independence against aggression. In this very year of 1968, more than
                            9,000 of our young men have been killed and more than 60,000 have been
                            wounded. If these sacrifices cannot assure our friends and allies as to
                            both our attitude and our determination, I do not see how the
                            achievement of a sense of assurance is possible. Certainly between such
                            close allies as the United States and the Republic of China there should
                            be no doubt on this score. The expression of such doubts, in the face of
                            the <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0726"/>extraordinary sacrifices we
                            are being called upon to make, would not be received well by the
                            American people and would give a powerful stimulation to those voices
                            among us who are urging isolation and withdrawal from our
                            responsibilities in other parts of the world. End message.</item>

                            fifty million dollar level. This, he said, was “too little”. Even with
                            the favorable U.S. policy on credit sales, the total available would be
                            “not adequate”. He expressed his hope that I would pass on these

                            Ministry of National Defense and other interested <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> agencies on the first draft of a
                            prospective revision.</item>

                        <item>Mentioning the growing Chinese Communist Air Force capability, the
                            President expressed his hope that by next year the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have at least one squadron of the
                            latest model high capability fighter planes—such as recently supplied
                            Korea. (Later discussion revealed that the plane in question was the F4C
                            Phantom.) I remarked that the F5 planes now in use and programmed in
                            larger numbers, appear to be very appropriate, efficient and relatively
                            economical for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s requirements.
                            The Gimo responded that the F5 was good, and he appreciated our current
                            efforts to make it available to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            but he wished to reiterate that he still felt that one squadron of the
                            higher capacity fighters to lead the Chinese Air Force would greatly
                            help the morale in his armed forces and the ability of the <gloss target="#t_CAF1">CAF</gloss> to repel a Communist attack. He
                            suggested that perhaps there should be some reallocation of resources,
                            if necessary, to make this possible.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The President noted that while the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            had not contributed troops to Vietnam, it was shouldering a major
                            responsibility by tying down Communist troops on the South China coast.
                            The level of military aid, he hoped, would be determined with this
                            consideration in mind.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Comment: President <persName>Chiang</persName>'s remarks at this
                            meeting were among the most direct that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has thus far made about recent <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cuts. For the first time, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at a high level has officially labeled our anticipated
                            Military Assistance Program as “not adequate”. By inference, the Gimo
                            was apparently drawing a comparison between the level <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0728"/>of U.S. military assistance to his own
                            government and that being provided to Korea. The Gimo apparently was
                            seeking by this means to underscore the significance he felt the U.S.
                            should give <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts in the Far East,
                            including in particular its contribution in reducing pressures or
                            potential pressures on the U.S. position in Vietnam by immobilizing
                            large numbers of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> troops

                                insulate the regime from the effects of the Cultural Revolution.
                                This year, however, the weather is bad. There is a drought in north
                                China and serious floods in widespread areas in the south. The
                                Yangtze may be on a rampage.</p>
                            <p>Domestic fertilizer production is way down, perhaps as much as 50.
                                Record fertilizer purchases from Japan and Europe will arrive too
                                late to help the 1968 crop much.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>—Industry—Production dropped about 15% in 1967. Production is way down
                            in coal, the major energy source. The transportation system and the
                            major industrial centers have been particularly hard hit by Cultural
                            Revolution disorders.</item>
                        <item>—Foreign trade—The troubles with the industrial sector are strongly
                            reflected in foreign trade figures. There was a 12% drop in exports in
                            1967, and in the first half of 1968 exports to Japan were down
                            32.</item>

                        <item>—Political implications—The political impact of the declining economy
                            will be magnified by the breakdown of Communist China's effective
                            control. The prospects are for an economic mess approaching that which
                            followed the Great Leap Forward, but without the strong central control
                            which enabled the regime to diffuse the problem evenly throughout the
                            country. Local famine—perhaps widespread famine—is possible. This should
                            lead to a strengthening of pragmatic elements both in Peking and in the
                            provinces. If widespread famine becomes a reality, there will probably
                            be cause for international assistance. Without a major reorientation of
                            policies, however, Peking is not likely to be responsive to offers of
                            assistance from the United States.</item>

                        <item>Communist China's armed forces (known collectively as the Peoples
                            Liberation Army (<gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>)) have been drawn
                            deeply into the political turmoil that has afflicted China for the past
                            two and a half years. The <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> has taken
                            on heavy responsibilities for police and public security <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0730"/>work and has acquired a wide variety of
                            administrative and control functions in the economy and
                            government.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> has also undergone a heavy
                            purge, especially of its top echelons. Line combat units have so far
                            largely escaped the purges. The <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>
                            itself has been divided at various levels and buffeted by the politics
                            of the Cultural Revolution. Thus far the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> has taken its cue from the political leaders of the
                            country, but in general it has emerged as a moderate force loosely
                            aligned with the government bureaucracy and others whose primary concern
                            is with order, stability, and national security.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Political factionalism, the general deterioration of social order in
                            China, and the many extra duties that have been imposed on the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> have degraded Chinese military
                            capabilities largely in terms of readiness, morale, and discipline. But
                            in situations where China's vital interests were at stake, many of the
                            ill effects of the Cultural Revolution could probably be fairly quickly
                            overcome. Units, equipment, and the command structure remain intact, and
                            defensive dispositions are largely unimpaired. Thus the PLA could
                            provide a strong defense of the mainland and would be capable of
                            effective military operations should the exist-ence of the Communist
                            regimes in North Vietnam and North Korea be threatened.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>Conceivably the political, social, and economic situation could
                            deteriorate to the point where the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>'s
                            combat effectiveness would suffer severe damage. On the other hand, a
                            consistent trend toward moderation could enable it to regain full
                            effectiveness within a fairly short time. On balance, we believe that
                            the situation will not get so bad that the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> would be unable to maintain a capability to function as
                            a fighting force; nevertheless, much of its time and energy will
                            continue to be diverted by nonmilitary activity and political stress.
                            For the coming year at least, the power and authority of the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> are likely to increase. Peking will be
                            dependent on the <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> as the only
                            effective instrument of control, and the military will probably play a
                            significant role in the political reorganization currently in
                            process.</item>

                        <item>Except for the disruption caused by the Cultural Revolution, there
                            have been few developments in China's general purpose and air defense
                            forces of great significance during the past year. Positioning of
                            Chinese forces has changed little and continues to reflect concern with
                            defense. The Chinese have not given a high priority to equipment
                            programs that would improve China's ability to project its power over
                            long distances outside its borders. The limitations of China's economic
                            and technical capacities are such that conventional forces will remain
                            deficient in modern equipment at least until well into the
                            1970's.</item>

                        <item>Nevertheless, the modernization program for the air defense and
                            general purpose forces is moving ahead gradually on a fairly broad front
                            along the following lines: <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0731"/>

                                <item>The Army. Chinese combat units vary considerably in quality
                                    and strength, but their firepower is increasing with the
                                    addition of more medium tanks and artillery. The levels of
                                    equipment the Chinese seem to be aiming at cannot be reached
                                    throughout the army much before 1975. No significant increase in
                                    the number of combat units is anticipated, although some
                                    increase in manpower might occur in response to the army's
                                    assumption of widened civil responsibilities.</item>

                                <item>Air. A growing inventory of Mig-19 fighters, addition of
                                    better radar, and a slow deployment program for surface-to-air
                                    missiles are improving China's air defense. We continue to
                                    believe that the Chinese will produce a new fighter, and we now
                                    believe that the chances are about even that it will be the
                                    Mig-21. If the Chinese do not intend to produce this aircraft,
                                    it would be four or five years before a fighter significantly
                                    more advanced than the Mig-19 could be available. There has been
                                    no significant change in the tactical strike and air support
                                    capabilities of the Chinese Air Force and Naval Air

                            President <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0732"/>did not take up

                            forces. Instead he concentrated exclusively on major pitch for one
                            squadron F4C planes, following up original request made to me on July 15
                            (Taipei 3761).<note n="3" xml:id="d322fn3">

                            decision be made by U.S. “within few weeks”, terming matter one of

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Gimo asserted repeatedly that maintenance of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> air superiority over <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in Taiwan Strait area was an imperative necessity.
                            He was convinced that air superiority once lost could almost certainly
                            never be regained, even with later U.S. assistance. He recalled that air
                            superiority had enabled <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to emerge
                            victorious in Taiwan Strait crisis of 1958. Loss of air superiority now
                            would have serious psychological and morale repercussions, apart from
                            purely military considerations. Communists would be emboldened if they
                            no longer feared <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Air Force and
                            almost certainly would embark on new aggressions, most likely against
                            Offshore Islands or main island of Taiwan itself. If the Communists
                            should achieve the capability of interdicting the supply lines between
                            Taiwan and Offshores, consequences would be highly prejudicial to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> defense.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Gimo observed that <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s already
                            have three very disturbing capabilities which they are reserving mainly
                            for use against Taiwan, viz.: short range missiles, submarines capable
                            of operating effectively in Taiwan Strait, and <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s. He asserted that <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are now building <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s in increasing numbers and balance of air power will
                            soon be shifted in their favor if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            Air Force not strengthened with some high capability ultra-modern
                            planes, namely F4Cs. Gimo noted that while F5 remains principal reliance
                            Chinese Air Force, it cannot match the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21, and he feels a few higher performance planes are
                            essential to spearhead <gloss target="#t_CAF1">CAF</gloss> capability to
                            counter <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21, threat and maintain
                            deterrent posture toward <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Gimo emphasized favorable geographical situation of Taiwan as central
                            point along China periphery. Strength based on Taiwan can be readily
                            redeployed either to S.E. Asia or to Korea. He would think of F4Cs on
                            Taiwan as being an asset for overall allied position, and not solely for
                            benefit or <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Gimo said that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces on Kinmen,
                            Matsu and Taiwan itself directly tie down 500,000 <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> troops along coastal areas
                            opposite Taiwan Strait and indirectly one million additional forces
                            farther inland. The neutralization of this large Chinese Communist force
                            could not be maintained if air superiority is lost. Also <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> and other air bases on Taiwan which
                            would be essential for use of U.S. Air Force in event of general <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0733"/>area hostilities could be
                            readily knocked out by <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s if
                            they obtained air superiority.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Gimo concluded that all these considerations added up to compelling
                            need at earliest possible date for supplying <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Air Force with squadron of F4Cs and he pleaded for an
                            expeditious decision by Departments of Defense and State.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>General Warren expressed sympathetic understanding of President
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s interest in highly modern aircraft as
                            a means of maintaining needed air superiority. At same time he pointed
                            out difficulties related to funds, availability of planes, Congressional
                            attitudes and undeferrable requirements of S.E. Asia and other high
                            priority exposed areas. All of this made it unlikely that planes so
                            costly and scarce as F4Cs could be allocated to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in present circumstances. However he promised to relay
                            President's request to Washington and see that it was carefully examined
                            in Defense.</item>

                            response to query from the President said he agreed with the President's
                            analysis of military situation and need for maintaining <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> air superiority. (He did not have
                            opportunity to spell out his reasons for believing that delivery of F4Cs
                            to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is not a realistic possibility at
                            this stage. But he intends to elaborate his views fully to Defense
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> next
                            week.)</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I told President <persName>Chiang</persName> that without debating
                            merits of F4C request at this time, I felt compelled to express my
                            strong misgivings at the development of a requirement so appallingly
                            expensive that if filled it would leave little or no <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> resources for agreed high priority
                            items of military materiel—many of which have already been programmed
                            after careful planning. I felt there was need for maintenance of a
                            balanced defense structure and that one exceedingly expensive new item
                            should not be allowed to exclude many other high priority items which
                            were essential to a balanced defense force structure. I said the
                            pressing problem before us was to determine how to cover the most
                            essential defense requirements for all services within the strict limits
                            of U.S. and Chinese resources available for defense purposes.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>The President replied that according to an old Chinese proverb, “First
                            things first.” He considered that air superiority took priority over
                            everything else and he would not himself go into the matter of
                            priorities for competing items which in his view would not have the same
                            urgency as the F4C.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>At close of meeting, President made formal request that as an interim
                            measure while F4C request is being considered, U.S. station one squadron
                            of <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F4Cs on Taiwan as a deterrent
                            to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. While he would want these
                            planes based on Taiwan, they would of course be available from this
                            central point for use wherever needed in the East Asian area. (N.B.,
                            later in evening Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> sent word <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0734"/>to Gens. Warren and <persName corresp="#p_CMGRG1">Ciccolella</persName> that Pres. <persName>Chiang</persName> had
                            not meant to insist that any <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            squadron stationed on Taiwan must consist of F4Cs. Any type of plane
                            chosen by <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> would be

                        <item>Tom Shoesmith has put together an excellent first draft on the

                            <p>Tom's assumptions stated on page 7 serve his purpose. I believe,
                                however, that the Offshore Islands present awkward and even
                                dangerous problems under some contrary assumptions. I mention,
                                illustratively: <list>

                            <p>Under these and still other assumptions, we would not, I think, be
                                deflected from the conclusions to which Tom's general analysis
                                leads.</p>

                        <item>As to one of Tom's recommended courses of action, I doubt the wisdom
                            of a U.S. attempt, under any circumstances, to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to remove its forces on Quemoy and
                            Matsu. If this is done, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should
                            do it itself and for its own reasons. United States pressure would
                            invite a process of bargaining in which the United States could be
                            trapped into paying a price to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>,
                            financially, politically, and in degree of strategic involvement, that
                            might not be desirable or necessary to pay.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I do not believe that to establish, credibly, United States
                            indifference to the future of the Offshore Islands would stimulate
                            Peking to take them over. Peking and Taipei view the Offshores in an
                            identical historical and strategic context, seeing them as the linchpin
                            that locks the future of Taiwan into the future of the China Mainland.
                            Both capitals know that a change of status of the Offshores—limiting
                            effective jurisdiction of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at
                            Taiwan and the Pescadores alone and putting 100 miles of ocean between
                            that area and the Chinese Communist territories on the Mainland—would
                            become powerful justification for the people of Formosa—and advocates of
                            peace everywhere in the world—to proceed, in terms of both recognition
                            and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representation, from the present
                            de facto “One China”/“One Taiwan” situation towards de jure arrangements
                            which would make notion of a “One China”, including Taiwan, appear even
                            more fanciful than now. Neither Peking nor followers of Generalissimo
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could welcome that development.<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">The following paragraph is handwritten on the
                                source text following the typewritten text: “While I remain somewhat

                    <p>For the past six weeks or so, and most clearly in the past ten days, there
                        has been the most country-wide shift toward the conservatives yet seen in
                        the past two years. Matters have, in fact, gone so far in the provinces in
                        the direction of the old-liners and under military auspices that one must
                        wonder what is happening to the position of <persName corresp="#p_LPLB1">Lin
                            Piao</persName> himself. Current policy is certainly different from what
                        he has espoused since 1964.</p>
                    <p>Revolutionary committees have been set up in the last few days in both Yunnan
                        and Fukien Provinces. Both are completely dominated by the military and each
                        of the chairmen have in the past been under Red Guard criticism.</p>
                    <p>The Red Guards, on the other hand, have fallen on lean days indeed.</p>
                    <p>These moves have been accompanied by the strongest measures taken to date by
                        the Army to stop factional fighting. Summary executions have been resorted
                        to in a number of instances. A back-to-work movement appears to have met
                        with limited but perhaps slowly growing success.</p>
                    <p>Increased army patrol activity has been noted in Peking in recent days, and
                        an important army unit long stationed on the Korean border has been moved
                        into Peking.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing new on the harvest, except that Peking has entered into
                        urgent negotiations with Australia for wheat deliveries after December.
                        Peking is expected also to negotiate with Canada for further purchases.</p>
                    <p>There has been speculation that the heavy rains and the natural peak (from
                        melted snows far to the west) might cause devastating floods.</p>

                    <p>You were probably shown these two cables. The gist of

                            <item>—<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> will construe the
                                Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia as a warning and threat to him;
                                i.e., the Soviets will now be likely, in <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s mind, to install
                                    anti-<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> leaders as
                                administrators of border areas of China, laying the groundwork for
                                the downfall of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>;</item>
                            <item>—<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> will attempt to
                                consolidate a strong position in South China, hence will need
                                control of flanking areas in Southeast Asia and in the Taiwan
                                Straits area;</item>
                            <item>—accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> will get
                                more deeply involved in the Vietnam war, and apply pressure to the
                                Offshore Islands—with the possibility of at least air attacks on
                                Taiwan.</item>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> of his belief that the five southern provinces
                        should be subtracted from <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                        control and that the Soviet Union would permit this gladly, but he said he
                        did not wish to raise this again officially with Washington. He merely
                        reiterated his conviction that he must have air superiority over the Chinese
                        Communists. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CS1">Chow</persName>'s call on
                        the Secretary Monday morning, asking for a squadron of F4C's or, failing
                        that, the stationing of U.S. sophisticated planes on Taiwan, is part of his
                        present ploy.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we have no evidence of Chinese Communist preparation for action
                        against the Offshore Islands or for increased participation in the Vietnam
                        war. While under circumstances of both the Soviets and Chinese Communists
                        being in very difficult straits may raise the possibility <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0738"/>of completely irrational action,
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>'s reasoning as to likely developments still
                        appears to be very far out indeed.</p>
                    <p>One is tempted, in fact, to wonder whether <persName>Chiang</persName> is
                        losing his grip on reality. I do not think that this is the correct
                        interpretation. All reports indicate that he is both mentally alert and well
                        informed. I think the explanation for the remarkable line of reasoning
                        outlined in the attached cables lies in his anxious grasping at straws at
                        this particular juncture, and that he fully recognizes that they are straws.
                        I believe that basically his request for highly sophisticated aircraft (a
                        squadron would cost about $50 million) and the tortuous justification is a
                        result of his very deep concern at the prospect of: <list>

                                and uncertainty as to the degree of our continued presence in East

                    </p>
                    <p>In other words, there is considerable sanity in the Gimo's “madness” if what
                        he is doing is trying to get a new, high-silhouetted U.S. commitment of
                        support in the later days of the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        Administration, which would be difficult to overlook by the new
                        administration. He probably reasons that a new administration may well
                        attempt new initiatives in East Asian policy before the career bureaucracy
                        is given a chance to help with the new administration's homework. He
                        probably wants to make it awkward for new departures to be taken hastily
                        before the “lessons,” which he believes might emerge from that homework, can
                        be applied.</p>
                    <p>It makes no sense to give <persName>Chiang</persName> a squadron of F4C's and
                        they are committed for many months ahead in any event. Nor would it be wise
                        to “station” a squadron of our own sophisticated aircraft on Taiwan. We
                        should avoid anything which could be called “bases” as such on Taiwan. We
                        might, however, “deploy” to Taiwan a few planes from the area, briefly and
                        intermittently. State and Defense will look into this.</p>
                    <p>In short, if we can find a way of reaffirming our present commitments to the
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> without escalating them, but
                        possibly with the added increment of a new gesture, it is probably in our
                        interests to do so—partly for some of the reasons which I suppose to be in
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>'s own mind. We should not, however, humor
                        his present needs beyond the confines of U.S. interests per se. His true
                        needs are not that great—at least as we can now see them.</p>

                            while before contacts were made, and in meantime contacts would be made

                            <persName>Sharp</persName> said that his Government was not intending to
                            make any direct contacts with Peking at present time and procedure for
                            pursuing objective was not yet firm. He said he saw no reason to change
                            Canadian posture on China at this <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.
                            Canadians recognize that if they do achieve mutual recognition between
                            Peking and Ottawa, they would have to show consistency in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But matter would not arise this session.
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that US policy
                            remained same as at previous sessions: Viet-Nam figured importantly in
                            this matter for us. <persName>Sharp</persName> then said that CanDel at
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would support Important Question
                            resolution, would abstain on Albanian-type resolution, and would give no
                            encouragement to any Italian Study Committee proposal. Ultimate
                            intention was to change position, but it would not happen at this
                            session. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            estimated that Italy could well be expected to put up again its Study
                            Committee resolution in view of former Moro government's having done no
                            less. He thought voting pattern would remain about same. He said that if
                            mutual recognition should transpire, Canadian Ambassador ought to be
                            provided with file and loaf of bread. <persName>Sharp</persName>
                            responded by saying that Canadians would also have to provide more
                            police to follow Chinese Representatives in Canada. But he went on more
                            seriously to say that Canada hoped it could promote communications with
                            Peking, which would make effort worthwhile. Canadian public supported
                            Government's position.</item>

                            to meet situation created by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>

                        approach must be in the context of Asia-wide revolutionary pressures, and
                        with attention to the persistent Asian power imbalances which make the

                    </p>
                    <p>The last three wars in which the United States has been directly involved
                        began for us as Asian wars. While the origins of all three were complex, a
                        major factor in each instance was a neglected imbalance of power in the area
                        which made for fundamental instability. In each case the United States
                        finally had to fill the vacuum. Many argue that we did so belatedly each
                        time—after war was inevitable. It is true that we gave signals prior to each
                        conflict which could be, and doubtless were, interpreted by the adversaries
                        as indicating that we did not plan to provide a counterbalance, and
                        therefore that expansionist moves could be made with impunity. Then when
                        aggression took place, we found it necessary to oppose it, at great
                        cost.</p>
                    <p>Some of this cost may be laid at the door of our relative ignorance—at least
                        until fairly recently—of the nature and importance to us and to the rest of
                        the world of the various revolutions in Asia, peaceful and otherwise. New
                        political institutions, forced economic modernization, and rapidly shifting
                        social patterns have been superimposed on the old ways, and power centers
                        have shifted, with the creation of explosive tensions. <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0744"/>Americans have not been very familiar with
                        the old ways, which has complicated the job of understanding the reasons
                        behind present-day actions and reactions.</p>
                    <p>Still, in recent years our understanding of these intrusive Asian
                        developments has grown rapidly. It is ironic that just at the time when we
                        have achieved fuller appreciation of what must be done in Asia, both the
                        willingness and the capacity of the United States to continue to carry the
                        major burden there has come into question (quite apart from the correctness
                        of our having carried it thus far).</p>
                    <p>We cannot allow another Asian power vacuum to arise. The fact remains that
                        the next war in which our forces will be directly involved, if it comes, is
                        more likely to come in Asia than anywhere else. Berlin, Hungary and
                        Czechoslovakia underline the reluctance of the superpowers for a test of
                        force in Europe, and another Near East conflagration would stand a good
                        chance of being a proxy war. Not so in Asia. There we are intricately
                        engaged, and must continue to be, though at a reduced level as soon as this
                        is possible. The present balance of power, by courtesy of very heavy
                        American presence, is unnatural to the area. If it persists for much longer,
                        we will be asking for cumulative trouble. We must contrive a rebalance, with
                        China principally in mind.</p>
                    <p>Japan and China, the key countries of East Asia proper (excluding the two
                        superpowers whose interests in Asia are great) are both in an unnatural
                        state of affairs, which cannot last.</p>
                    <p>Japan, though the third largest industrial power on earth, is all but
                        unarmed. It is unthinkable that, considering the enormous bulge of its
                        economic muscles, Japan will for many more years accept a situation where
                        others can say “No!” and Japan cannot say “But, yes!” When the psychological
                        and constitutional blocks to the inevitable transformation in Japanese
                        defense doctrine start to give, they may dissolve more rapidly than now
                        seems likely. Japan is bound increasingly to resent our filling its defense
                        needs, even if we do so by insistent invitation while Japan is gleefully
                        obsessed with the economic advantage which our defense affords. Despite the
                        present easily documentable demands of efficiency and economy for bases in
                        meeting our commitments in the area, we will do well in our long-term
                        interest to insure that we act a bit harder to get: that we are sought,
                        rather than tolerated until we are not tolerated. Until Japan rearms, as it
                        will, we must use our leverage to press for very sizeable economic and
                        indirect military contribution to the non-communist Asian balance. This is
                        not only necessary in the overall East Asian context, it is also the very
                        essence of a sensible China policy—especially so long as the China problem
                        is not subject to direct approach.</p>
                    <p>The second of the great Asian nations, too, is in a highly unnatural and
                        unstable state. China has already become powerful in Asian terms, but it is
                        “contained.” That containment has been necessary, given China's <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0745"/>advertised intentions and demonstrable
                        actions in line with the Maoist prescription for world revolution. However,
                        China when strong has always had a sphere of influence on its periphery not
                        unlike that which other strong nations throughout history have insisted
                        upon. In China's case this natural penchant is strengthened both by its
                        historical “center-of-the-universe” syndrome and by its determination to
                        overcompensate, if possible, for the “century of ignominy” which it suffered
                        at the hands of western predators. A century ago China failed to provide
                        itself with gunboats, so it had to take alien semi-masters, both theological
                        and secular—and both bearing a monopoly on truth to a Kingdom which had
                        considered itself the source of truth and righteousness for at least four
                        thousand years! Unmistakable paranoia understandably results.</p>
                    <p>Post-World War II events have decreed that this weary problem—China and the
                        attendant regional power imbalance—is excessively ours. However, even if
                        Asian self-interest should demand it, and even if both our will and our
                        resources were abundant to the task, a long-term overweening American
                        presence would become an affront to Asian sensibilities of perhaps
                        irreparable severity.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The U.S. Dilemma</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We cannot afford to lessen our support prematurely; likewise we cannot afford
                        to project present clear requirements very far into the future. We must
                        reduce the problem (principally China) or further share the burden of coping
                        with it—or both.</p>
                    <p>We are making progress—too slowly to dissolve the dilemma, but not without
                        success—in sharing the burden. The positive aspects of our Asian policies
                        post-World War II have been directed to this end. We have successfully
                        bought time for non-communist Asia, and more has been made of that time than
                        we had any right to expect from the tatterdemalion array of weak,
                        inexperienced, mostly newly-independent nations scattered around China in
                        the wake of World War II. Regional strength and cooperation are growing, but
                        not fast enough to ease the faster growing insistence of our dilemma.</p>
                    <p>Diminishing the problem itself is the more attractive tack. But our would-be
                        leverage with China remains unfeared. So long as the Maoists are in control,
                        there is no meshing of gears to be had. In the Maoists we are confronted by
                        secular religionists, who have insistently cast us in the devil's role for
                        their own purposes. No compromise is possible with a set of absolutes; and
                        logic is irrelevant in negotiating with a faith. Taiwan is a major practical
                        issue between us, but if we could hand it over gratis the Maoists would
                        still lock us in their “inimical embrace,” because of the ideological
                        demands of their continuing revolution and their simplistic faith.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The immediate question with respect to United States policy toward China is
                        whether the supposedly inevitable, definitive failure of Maoist policies has
                        now set in, to the extent of presaging a “change of dynasty.” The answer,
                        unfortunately, is that we do not know, and may not know for months to
                        come.</p>
                    <p>What we do know is that the two great erstwhile strengths of the
                            Maoists—<persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s prestige and the
                        loyalty of the masses—have suffered deep erosion during the past two years
                        of lunacy. We know from the reports of individuals from the mainland and
                        from the cries of the regime's press and radio that cynicism, despair and
                        simple exhaustion are left in the trail of <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s second major attempt to remake Chinese man and
                        re-invigorate his revolution. We know that the intellectuals and many
                        students are fed up, and that vast numbers of cadres who worked hard to make
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s kind of China work are
                        angered at being bitterly struggled against. We know that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> was virtually deified in the anxious
                        attempt to make failure impossible, yet he has not succeeded. And when a god
                        fails, business as usual thereafter is improbable.</p>
                    <p>On the other side of the coin, the vast country has not come apart. Economic
                        and social damages have been serious but not catastrophic, and could be
                        recouped if order and authority are restored. Most of the Army seems
                        responsive to central direction. And most importantly for our purposes,
                        there is no sign yet of meaningful change in either domestic or foreign
                        policies—only in tactics, which have become less frenetic.</p>
                    <p>China is desperately trying to re-establish its old position and stature in a
                        nuclear world. In a sense it is trying to do what the rest of the world is
                        so anxious about its not having done: become a part of the modern world. The
                        tragedy is that it is not doing so cooperatively. So far it has been
                        unwilling to join the world except on its own terms, which are absurd. It
                        wants literally to become the “center of the universe” again, and to
                        refashion the rest of the world in its own image. Its efforts to regain its
                        central position have produced crazily compressed time schedules, costly
                        disruptions, and superhuman requirements for discipline and austerity.</p>
                    <p>An original purpose of the Cultural Revolution was to frighten, goad and
                        inspire the populace into meeting these rigorous requirements. The movement
                        got out of hand, policy differences and power struggles intensified, and a
                        crisis of authority resulted. The Army was reluctantly brought into play and
                        hundreds of thousands of fractious Red Guards packed off to work in the
                        countryside. The biggest casualty to date is the self-confidence of the
                        cadres and officials. The regime now intends to rebuild the party, chastened
                        and cleansed, with the Army maintaining discipline meanwhile. That is where
                        we are today, and it is still premature to attempt judgment on the
                        future.</p>

                    <p>Such is the recognized importance of China in our scheme of things, however,
                        that Americans have tended not to forgive those who later prove not to have
                        been prophetic, even prescient, about developments in Chinese affairs. A
                        number of Foreign Service Officers put out to pasture can attest to this
                        fact. We cannot well weather another orgy of national self-flagellation at
                        having seemed to guess wrongly as to the likely course of a quarter of
                        mankind, or as to the appropriate United States response.</p>
                    <p>We have long said that at the propitious time we should insure that Peking is
                        aware that it has policy options other than continued rabid anti-Americanism
                        and anxious self-isolation from world currents. We have rightly attempted
                        some steps toward that assurance. But it is not yet time energetically to
                        woo China into the world.</p>
                    <p>The satisfactory articulation of China with the rest of the world is
                        conceivable only on terms consonant with the sort of world envisaged in the
                        United Nations Charter: one of cooperative diversity. That sort of world
                        cannot be created in safe durability without the participation of the
                        quarter of mankind which is Chinese, but Maoist China will not join that
                        sort of world.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, as our policy toward China has become less rigid, there have
                        been three circumstances in which it would make sense for the United States
                        seriously to seek accommodation with the mainland regime.</p>

                    <p>None of these situations has yet come about, although the first may be slowly

                    <p>As for the third, it is true that the Chinese Communist armed forces remain a
                        formidable force, despite Cultural Revolution preoccupations. They pose a
                        potential threat to other Asian nations, but not directly to us. If China's
                        nuclear potential develops as expected, its world status and its blackmail
                        potential toward some may be enhanced, but it is not likely to pose a
                        significant threat directly to the United States until it develops a strong
                        naval tradition. This may come, but it will take a long time. We have a
                        fairly comfortable grace period in which we do not, for instance, have to
                        allow Peking to “shoot its way into the United Nations” or make other
                        comparable forced accommodation, come what may.</p>

                                been no freedom of expression, there has been no freedom of silence.

                        under present management, is the first to say that such is
                        inconceivable—except on terms so provincial and anachronistic, so hostile to
                        all that has been built toward world order since World War II, so
                        antithetical to the true revolution in human freedom of the past two
                        centuries, that the very resignation of these positive traditions would seem
                        to be involved in the acceptance of Chinese terms.</p>
                    <p>There are sincere and able people in the United States Government and in the
                        academic community who say that we must try harder. Some seem to think that
                        if we would only turn the other cheek we would get kissed. Unlikely. Others

                                to China in today's climate, and must be heeded by policy

                    </p>
                    <p>The deal-with-China shopping lists of those of us who are Sinophiles, or
                        those who are simply very worried about China's isolation, have been passed
                        around town and the academic community for years. It seems that each time
                        serious thought has been given to some of the more meaningful of the
                        proposed steps, Peking has comported itself in such a way as to make the
                        steps appear not to be in the U.S. interest. The present period of extreme
                        Maoism would seem to be an especially unpromising time for forward movement.
                        The situation is fluid, however, and could change fairly rapidly, or it
                        could simmer along for some while.</p>
                    <p>The shopping lists vary with advocates, but they variously include:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recognition?</hi> Peking would not recognize Washington.
                        It would cheerfully accept our compliment, but keep us cooling our heels
                        outside the Gate of Heavenly Peace.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Entry into the United Nations?</hi> Under present Peking
                        management, this as a minimum would be at the cost of the seat of a
                        well-behaved member and ally, and as a maximum at the cost of warping the
                        United Nations out of recognition.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Unrestricted travel?</hi> This should probably be accepted
                        now in any case, but especially since the Supreme Court has taken the teeth
                        out of this sort of travel restriction. It could be done at any time, if
                        there were sufficient excuse through some particular turn of events. It
                        probably should be done quietly next March, when the annual listing of
                        restricted countries automatically comes up. It will not enhance our
                        relations, since Peking fears an exchange of people. It is in the category
                        of harmless tidiness, with an eye for the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">More contact between newsmen, scholars, scientists,
                            etc.?</hi> On balance, this could only be to our advantage, for we are
                        the stronger society with the more viable ideology. We pushed contact
                        belatedly, not in the post-Bandung period when it might have worked (or if
                        not, might have proved an interesting embarrassment to Peking) but prior to
                        and during the Cultural Revolution, when it had no chance. We will have
                        another chance, but the time is not yet here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Trade on the level of that with European communist
                            countries?</hi> This deserves more thought. Some of the arguments in
                        favor, with comment: <list>
                            <item>—The Cultural Revolution is wearing itself out, and more practical
                                people are coming to the fore in China. They should be encouraged by
                                tangible moves such as lowered trade restrictions. (It is premature
                                to <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0750"/>make the judgment
                                concerning the emergence of more practical leadership. U.S.
                                top-level statements expressing hope for eventual reconciliation and
                                our conduct at Warsaw should be adequate signaling to “the more
                                practical people.”)</item>
                            <item>—We should bring our treatment of Asian communist nations in line
                                with our treatment of European ones. (But the communist-fed war we
                                are now fighting is in Asia.)</item>
                            <item>—The majority of State's China Panel members believe that timing
                                is not important; there seems never to be a “good” time to alter our
                                policy on trade, but it must be done in the long-term U.S. interest.
                                (To do it now would be ill received in America and most of
                                Asia.)</item>
                            <item>—President <persName>Johnson</persName> is well known for standing
                                firmly against communist advance in Asia, and he could take this
                                step without being accused of being soft on communism. (During
                                Vietnam? and post-Czech occupation?)</item>
                            <item>—We would not be announcing the resumption of trade, but simply
                                removing impediments, to influence the “good guys” in China. (So
                                long as the Maoists are in control, it could actually discourage the
                                good guys.)</item>
                            <item>—This step would reassure Hanoi that the rigidities of our stand
                                do not flow from any doctrine of blanket hostility to Asian
                                communism, but relate to North Vietnamese aggression against South
                                Vietnam. (We are not hostile to Asians, but we need not apologize
                                for being hostile to the policies of Asian communist
                                nations.)</item>
                            <item>—China gets everything it needs anyway from Japan and Western
                                Europe; American business is at a disadvantage. (There is
                                considerable truth in this, but there is little clamor in American
                                business circles for trade with China—presumably because of
                                recognition of the larger issues involved.)</item>
                            <item>—It is important, through contact, to make inroads into the
                                dangerous provincialism of China's leaders. (So it is, but we have
                                tried in other ways, and been rebuffed.)</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>We should keep clearly in mind that the very degree of success of our present
                        policies toward China recommends caution in altering them, until the nature
                        of China itself is more clearly altered:</p>
                    <p>—So far we have “contained” Chinese expansionist tendencies remarkably well,
                        thereby buying valuable time for non-communist Asia.</p>
                    <p>—Although not subject to documentary proof, we can be sure that our firm
                        stand in Vietnam and our reasonable posture of desiring contact and eventual
                        reconciliation with mainland China have combined to exacerbate policy
                        differences in Peking, contributing to the disunity and weakness of our
                        self-proclaimed adversary.</p>
                    <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0751"/>
                    <p>—In its 19-year history the regime has never had such fundamental troubles at
                        home, or stood so low in international esteem. It is no longer a model for
                        developing countries.</p>
                    <p>—We have prevented Peking from ousting the Republic of China from the United
                        Nations, and from entering itself, where, particularly in its recent mood,
                        it would have been a disrupting influence of serious and perhaps disastrous
                        proportions.</p>
                    <p>—For the first time there is a better than fair prospect that the very nature
                        of the regime, because of its failures, will have to change.</p>
                    <p>Until the nature of the change is more evident, it is a time for close
                        scrutiny rather than overtures.</p>
                    <p>The Dubious Case for Movement</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, those who advocate movement in China policy now have a case
                        which should not be lightly shrugged off. Essentially, they argue that we
                        are already very late in being more forthcoming, and we take insupportable
                        risks in not seeking accommodation more actively.</p>
                    <p>Many of Communist China's leaders who oppose <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> (including house-arrested President Liu Shao-ch'i), if
                        not exactly pro-Soviet are at least pro-Soviet aid, which they view as the
                        only hope of a rapid regaining of China's position in the world. While even
                        after <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> a return to the fraternal
                        Sino-Soviet collusion of the 1950's is unlikely, a papering over of
                        differences involving some Soviet aid in return for an acceptable degree of
                        political docility on China's part would have its attraction to both
                        parties, and is not inconceivable. If this should happen, we would be
                        accused because of our “rigid” policies of missing the chance to influence
                        at the right moment the supposed “good guys,” or even of “blind dedication
                        to the fortunes of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                        Kai-shek</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>So long as China is unarticulated with the world mainstream, the problems
                        posed in the areas of disarmament, non-proliferation and a more workable
                        security mechanism, in or outside the United Nations, are obvious. Sooner or
                        later the weight of these considerations is bound to increase.</p>
                    <p>The argument that we lose the respect of important friends through our
                        “rigidity” is less cogent than it was before Peking scandalized itself at
                        home and abroad in the Cultural Revolution. Post-Vietnam, and further away
                        from the Czech crisis, if Peking should become appreciably more reasonable
                        we should take stock again.</p>
                    <p>The death of either <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> or
                            <persName>Chiang</persName> would also call for careful weighing of
                        possible developments and appropriate responses, depending on the timing and
                        the context.</p>
                    <p>In sum, our policy toward Communist China in recent years has accomplished in
                        good measure about all that could be expected, short of bilateral
                        accommodations which are just not yet in the cards. Our policy <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0752"/>has been consistent but not static. It has
                        steadfastly opposed Chinese meddling and aggression; but it has moved toward
                        seeking contact. The ground is well laid to move further when China is
                        ready, if it seems in our interest.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the best policy toward communist Asia, beyond containment, is
                        concentration on strengthening non-communist Asia, with a view to ultimate
                        reduction of the U.S. component in the balance of power in the region.</p>
                    <p>The other side of China policy is Taiwan and its ramifications. I should like
                        to address those tangles, including the offshore islands problem, in another
                            paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2">No such paper has been found.</note>

                            additional F–104G's to maintain the air defense capability which

                    <p>For several weeks developments have moved very slowly on the Chinese
                        mainland—or so it has seemed. We cannot be sure, because many of our sources
                        have dried up. Wall posters are fewer and are uninformative (the Red Guard
                        authors have been packed off to the countryside), Red Guard newspapers have
                        disappeared, and foreigners are no longer allowed to receive provincial
                        newspapers. Mail is being more carefully censored, and the populace is
                        shunning travelers (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">Tab A is

                    <p>The October Central Committee Plenum was obviously designed to be a watershed
                        between the destructive and constructive periods in the Cultural Revolution.
                        (Both periods were promised when the movement began.) The Party is to be
                        rebuilt under Army supervision, with “new blood” from the workers and
                        peasants joining the revolutionary cadres. A completely revamped educational
                        system under control of workers and peasants is to keep the revolution
                        pure.</p>
                    <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0755"/>
                    <p>The forced dispatch of swarms of school age youth to the country-side for
                        “worker experience,” however, has produced resistance from the students,
                        their families, and the hapless peasant hosts, who complain of extra mouths
                        to feed without compensatory work input.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, there are signs that some sort of Great Leap Forward may be in the
                        offing. We are receiving a growing number of reports of the curbing of
                        private plots and other types of private sideline production, of the
                        increase in size and authority of production brigades, and of changes in the
                        work point system in the direction of income equalization (Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d330fn3">Tab B is telegram 9971 from Hong Kong, November

                        reward. The Cultural Revolution was designed to make this possible, but
                        resistance to a new leap is likely to be intense.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s basic problem is fairly
                        obvious. While there are times when ideological motivation may serve as the
                        prime mover of a country seeking modernization, no predetermined, fixed view
                        of an environment can hope to cope with the galloping modern world, which is
                        so variable in so many of its elements.</p>
                    <p>China's immense social forces moved chiefly through <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> for about a decade. But constant
                        stimulation is proving to be no substitute for pragmatism, and the basic
                        eclecticism of Chinese society is bound to assert itself. <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is anti-urban (he speaks rapturously
                        of “the quality of village life,” much like a Taoist sage) at a time when
                        urbanization is inevitable. He is anti-intellectual at a time when
                        “knowledge is power” to a degree unique in history. China's leader is now
                        largely in confrontation with the social forces of his country, which have
                        striven uncertainly for a century toward modernization.</p>
                    <p>So far <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> has sufficient power,
                        however, to make another try. In doing so he is now manifesting in extreme
                        form a classical trait of the visionary with a corner on ersatz truth:
                        pathological secrecy, coupled with fear of contamination from the outside.
                        This will give us added problems in following developments.</p>

                            <p>I have received your letters of September 12 and November 15. I am
                                now instructed to reply as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The Chinese Government was serious in suggesting on May 18
                                        that the 135th meeting of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial talks
                                        be held in the middle of November or late November. The
                                        Chinese Government has not indicated that it will change its
                                        view. It is most absurd for you to 'assume' groundlessly
                                        that China has changed its intention, and this is obviously
                                        a pretext.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>You have now asked for a postponement of the meeting until
                                        February next year. To put it bluntly, this is because the
                                        United States is going to change its President and the U.S.
                                        Government is now in a stage wherein the incoming is
                                        superseding the outgoing, and you want to drag on until the
                                        present period is over.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>Over the past 13 years, the Chinese Government has
                                        consistently adhered to the following two principles in the
                                        Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial talks: First—The U.S. Government
                                        undertakes to immediately withdraw all its armed forces from
                                        China's territory Taiwan Province and the Taiwan Straits
                                        area and dismantle all its military installations in Taiwan
                                        Province; second—The U.S. Government agrees that China and
                                        the United States conclude an agreement on the five
                                        principles of peaceful coexistence. But in the past 13
                                        years, while refusing all along to reach an agreement with
                                        the Chinese Government on these two principles, the U.S.
                                        Government, putting the cart before the horse, has kept on
                                        haggling over side issues. We once again tell you in
                                        explicit terms that the Chinese <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0757"/>Government will never barter away
                                        principles. If you continue your current practice, no result
                                        whatsoever will come of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial talks no
                                        matter which administration of yours assumes office.</item>

                                    <item>Since your side has found it necessary to ask for a
                                        postponement of the meeting, we can agree. We hereby make
                                        the specific suggestion that the meeting might as well be
                                        held on February 20 next year. By that time your new
                                        President will have been in office for a month and you will
                                        probably be able to make up your mind.</item>

                                    <item>Since your side has already made public statements on the
                                        further postponement of the 135th meeting of the Sino-U.S.
                                        Ambassadorial talks, our side will issue a statement to

                                <p>“Dear Mr. <persName>Chargé</persName> d'Affaires:</p>
                                <p>I have received your letter of November 25 in which you propose
                                    that the 135th Sino-US Ambassadorial meeting be held on February
                                    20, 1969. I accept your proposal, and I shall look forward to
                                    meeting with your side at 2:00 p.m. on that date.</p>
                                <p>It is my belief that the purposes of the Sino-United States
                                    Ambassadorial talks would be furthered at this juncture by a
                                    change of venue. Therefore, I propose that henceforth our
                                    meetings alternate between our respective embassies in
                                    accordance with the proposal by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang Ping-nan</persName> presented at a
                                    meeting between the representatives of our two countries on
                                    September 13, 1958. If this suggestion meets with your approval,
                                    we would be prepared to discuss with you at which of our
                                    respective embassies the February 20, 1969 meeting should take
                                    place.</p>
                                <p>If the suggested change in venue is not acceptable, I shall
                                    expect to meet you at the agreed date and time at our usual
                                    meeting place.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The attack on the institutions of provincial administration and control
                        during the early phases of the Cultural Revolution left Peking with an
                        enormous task of reconstructing party and government authority. Considerable
                        progress has been made in building a formal framework, but effective
                        government still eludes Peking in many areas.</p>
                    <p>In theory, the Revolutionary Committees inherited the functions and authority
                        of the former governing bodies, but in practice authority in most provinces
                        rests overwhelmingly with the military. Earlier political struggles have
                        left a legacy of factionalism in the body politic which in some provinces,
                        notably in Western China, results in persistent disruptive activity. The new
                        committees are especially weak in the instruments of control—police,
                        propaganda media, etc. Lawlessness continues to pose serious problems
                        although less so as time goes by. In most of Eastern China at least the
                        Army's new get tough mandate has led to widespread arrests, mass trials, and
                        often summary executions.</p>
                    <p>It took 20 months of wrangling to reach agreement on the selection of
                        officials to run all 29 Revolutionary Committees. The first six committees
                        were dominated by Maoist militants, but these have all given trouble and
                        members have already been purged in four of them. With one or two
                        exceptions, the 23 committees later formed have been headed by
                        conservatives—military officers or “rehabilitated” old-line party officials.
                        Military officers head 19 of the 29 provincial committees, and in 13 their
                        first vice chairmen are also military men.</p>
                    <p>Although the Revolutionary Committee as an institution was originally created
                        as a “provisional authority,” official pronouncements indicate a general
                        consensus that something built around the Revolutionary Committee will take
                        on permanence as an institution of government. The committees are viewed as
                        a core of a new structural form for the party and their conservative
                        influence is likely to be strong in the revitalization of the party
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The struggle between those who were on opposing sides during the Cultural
                        Revolution is likely to be bitter and will pose a major obstacle to <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0760"/>rebuilding the power structure.
                        Recent reports of investigation into the “class backgrounds” of party cadres
                        being considered for key posts reflect the intensive political infighting
                        which can be expected over the personnel issue.</p>
                    <p>Almost every day that passes, however, brings added indication that something
                        like pre-Cultural Revolution “normalcy” is returning to at least Peking's
                        style. In other words, conservative provincial power realities are being
                        reflected in Peking. Attached is one of the more interesting of these
                            indicators.<note n="2" xml:id="d333fn2">The attachment, telegram 10358
                            from Hong Kong, is not printed.</note> The contrast between <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>'s speech on the observation of
                        Albania's Liberation Day and the Albanian presentation is interesting. The
                        latter appears anachronistic—more suited to the Cultural Revolution climate
                        of some months ago. In <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        remarks, he all but ignores <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s
                        thought and the Cultural Revolution, and completely ignores Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I am beginning to think that the time may be near when we might profitably
                        give another signal (a minor but clear one) to Peking that it has policy
                        alternatives in our regard, when and if it is seriously ready to meet some
                        of the prerequisites. I think the presentation at the February 20 meeting
                        must be prepared with special care. It may be, too, that we could quietly
                        tidy up the <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> regulations. The somewhat
                        larger but still modest economic package contemplated some weeks ago, died
                        with the added burden of the Czechoslovak invasion. I plan to discuss <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> again at State, unless you see fit to
                        deflect me.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Shortly before the end of an otherwise social evening, Mr.
                            <persName>Davydov</persName> asked me if I had read the January issue of
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs.</hi> Assuming that <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0761"/>he was referring to the Kissinger article,
                        I replied “Yes”, and asked what he thought of that article. He said that it
                        was the clearest exposition he had seen, but that the article which
                        interested him most was Anatole Shub's, which while primarily discussing
                        Czechoslovakia, concluded by advocating a U.S.-Chinese rapprochement. I told
                        him that I had only read half of that article and had not reached the
                        portion about China.</p>
                    <p>Davydov said that it was no secret that the Soviet Union was greatly
                        concerned over the possibility of a U.S.-Chinese alliance. He said he could
                        understand our desire to react to Czechoslovakia and he appreciated the
                        ineffectiveness of any possible U.S. counter-move in Europe. Nonetheless, he
                        stated, an attempt to form a U.S.-Chinese alliance would be extremely
                        dangerous and he expressed the hope that I could make this point to anyone
                        of influence I knew in the next Administration. (Davydov is aware of my
                        current connection with Henry Kissinger.)</p>
                    <p>Davydov stated that any attempt by us to greatly improve our relations with
                        the Chinese and move them towards an alliance with us against the Soviet
                        Union would, of necessity, even if successful, take four to six years.
                        During this period, any hope of progress in U.S.-Soviet relations would be
                        completely impossible. Furthermore, Davydov claimed that we should not be as
                        confident as Shub was—that the eventual victors in the struggle for power in
                        China would be willing to enter an anti-Soviet alliance. He said that while
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> was capable of entering into
                        an anti-Soviet alliance, he would not think that someone like <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> would be willing to do so.</p>
                    <p>In Asia, Davydov thought the Soviet Union would attempt to counter a U.S.
                        move towards China by increased efforts to induce Japan to give up its
                        American alliance. In Europe, he could not rule out the possibility of
                        Soviet use of military force. I asked him where military force could be used
                        and he replied, Germany. I stated that I found it hard to take this
                        seriously since military moves in Germany would at the least bring us to the
                        edge of nuclear war. He replied that Western analysts were not the only ones
                        who were impressed with the efficiency of the Soviet move in
                        Czechoslovakia—that the Soviet military was also feeling confident as a
                        result of their success.</p>
                    <p>Davydov again told me how distressed he was at Shub's recommendation. He said
                        he was aware that some American officials had wanted the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to bluff a reconciliation with China in
                        order to scare the Soviet Union, but that Shub was recommending not a bluff
                        but a real reconciliation. While he described Shub as a brash young man, he
                        gave weight to the fact that his article had been printed in Foreign
                        Affairs. Davydov implied that Shub might be expelled from Moscow in
                        retaliation for his extremely provocative article.</p>
                    <p>Davydov said that the Soviet Union had been confident that the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration would not try to play the
                        dangerous game of <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0762"/>U.S.-Chinese
                        reconciliation. He asked whether I could give him any indication of my
                        estimate of the policy that the Nixon Administration was likely to follow. I
                        told him that I was unable to even hazard a guess. He asked if we could
                        discuss the matter further in the near future. (The conversation ended
                        abruptly as it became obvious that Davydov's seven-year-old son was
                        over-tired.)</p>

                        especially regarding its attitude toward the United States is a very
                        competent elaboration of the obvious—resulting in entirely appropriate
                        inconclusiveness. In other words, it is obvious that very little indeed is
                        obvious about the policy debate concerning Sino-U.S. relations which must be
                        going on in Peking.</p>
                    <p>I cannot bring myself to believe that Peking's communications with us
                        concerning the February 20 meeting constitute much of an invitation for
                        rapprochement. It probably is something of a signal of readiness to listen
                        to any interesting change in our own policy, which the new administration
                        may see fit to bring forth. I am knitting brows with EA on this, but I
                        suppose no one can go very far just now. I think our object should be to
                        work out some sort of modest trial balloon with safety devices. With so
                        little yet resolved in Peking, I do not think we can expect any constructive
                        moves toward us from that quarter. All we can do is, at a minimum, somewhat
                        exacerbate the policy struggle, and, at a maximum, provide a bit of
                        ammunition for those who may be somewhat less inimical to us than the
                        full-fledged Maoists.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Under current Treasury regulations</hi> a U.S. subsidiary
                        abroad is prohibited from selling any product it manufactures abroad to
                        China without specific Treasury approval. This is part of our complete
                        embargo on exports to China. The host countries in which these subsidiaries
                        are located have long charged that this regulation is an inappropriate
                        extension of U.S. jurisdiction and therefore an infringement of their
                        sovereignty. Their position is that a U.S. subsidiary in their country,
                        since it is subject to their jurisdiction, should operate under the same
                        regulations as any other firm doing business in their country. They object
                        to the “extraterritorial” aspect of our trade controls, which prohibit
                        companies under their jurisdiction from trading with China without the

                    <p>The recommended change in our regulations would go part way toward meeting
                        their objections. It would permit U.S. subsidiaries to sell to China those
                        non-strategic products that can be shipped freely from the U.S. to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe. For all other
                        products, the U.S. subsidiaries abroad would still have to obtain specific
                        Treasury authorization.</p>

                    <p>The proposed change would serve two purposes: <list>
                            <item>—It would reduce an irritant in our relations with friendly
                                countries—principally Canada, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                                and France.</item>
                            <item>—It might serve as a modest response to the faint signals from
                                Peking suggesting possible changes in their position. Although we
                                would describe the change as merely a technical adjustment in our
                                regulations designed to remove frictions with our Allies, Peking
                                might interpret it as a sign of flexibility in our own
                                position.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believes that it makes
                        good sense to act on this now—as a useful move prior to our scheduled
                        meeting with the Chinese Communists in Warsaw on February 20.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there is a tactical reason for making the change at this time.
                        It would set a modest precedent which your successor could either follow up
                        by extending the list of commodities or ignore. On the other hand, if he
                        initiated the change at the outset of his Administration, too much
                        significance would be read into it.</p>
                    <p>The main issue here is not substantive but psychological. Everyone agrees
                        that this change has no strategic significance since: <list>
                            <item>—It does not apply to strategic goods; and</item>
                            <item>—The Chinese can and do buy these non-strategic products from
                                other companies in the countries concerned.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore, the change could in no way improve China's strategic position.
                        Furthermore, the embargo on shipments to China from the U.S. would remain
                        unchanged. Nevertheless there will be some in Congress who will ignore these
                        facts and argue against any change in our regulations affecting China on the
                        grounds that it could lead to a deterioration of the system of strategic
                        trade controls and help China.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand there is sentiment on the Hill in favor of probing Chinese
                        intentions. (If you approve this action, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asks your advice on which Members of
                        Congress to consult from the list he attaches at Tab C of his memo.)</p>
                    <p>This is a modest move which I believe is worth making at this time. It does
                        not commit your successor but it could give him additional room to maneuver
                        should opportunities present themselves.</p>

                                had gone to support isolated Tibetan resistance groups within Tibet
                                and to the creation of a paramilitary force on the Nepal/Tibet
                                border of approximately 2,000 men, 800 of whom were armed by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                meeting, the Agency began a more broadly based political program
                                with the exiled Tibetans. This included bringing 133 Tibetans to the
                                United States for training in political, propaganda and paramilitary
                                techniques; continuing the support subsidy to the Dalai Lama's
                                entourage at Dharmsala, India; continuing support to the Nepal based
                                Tibetan guerrillas; the reassignment of a part of the unarmed
                                guerrillas to India for further training; and the [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Operational

                                is presently being built with a completion date scheduled in
                                February 1964.</p>
                            <p>One of the most serious problems facing the Tibetans is a lack of
                                trained officials equipped with linguistic and administrative
                                abilities. The Agency is undertaking the education of some 20
                                selected Tibetan junior officers to meet this need. A United States
                                advisory committee composed of prominent United States citizens has
                                been established to sponsor the education of these Tibetans. Cornell
                                University has tentatively agreed to provide facilities for their
                                education.</p>
                            <p>The Agency is supporting the establishment of Tibet Houses in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>] Geneva, and New York City. The Tibet Houses
                                are intended to serve as unofficial representation for the Dalai
                                Lama to maintain the concept of a separate Tibetan political
                                identity. The Tibet House in New York City will work closely with
                                Tibetan supporters in the United Nations, particularly the Malayan,
                                Irish, and Thai delegations.</p>

                    <p>Your Holiness:</p>
                    <p>I thank you for your gracious letter of November 18, 1964.</p>
                    <p>As you point out, the United States Government is deeply concerned with the
                        abrogation of the basic human rights of the Tibetan people and the
                        progressive elimination of their distinctive cultural and religious heritage
                        by the Communist Chinese.</p>
                    <p>The United States welcomed the opportunities in previous years to assist in
                        bringing the plight of the Tibetan people to the attention of world opinion
                        through the United Nations. As Your Holiness is aware, the United States has
                        also assisted directly in programs to alleviate the material hardships of
                        the Tibetans who have been forced to leave their homeland.</p>
                    <p>Your Holiness may be assured that the deep and abiding interest of the United
                        States in the welfare of the Tibetan people will continue. My Government
                        welcomes the initiative of the Governments of El Salvador, Nicaragua, and
                        the Philippines to place the Tibetan question on the agenda <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0768"/>of the Nineteenth Session of the United
                        Nations General Assembly. We wish, of course, to see the Tibetan item
                        succeed in the United Nations, and we will do everything appropriate to
                        support it.</p>
                    <p>With assurances of my highest esteem.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>2354. Tibet. Gyalo Thondup called on <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and Congressman O'Hara Nov. 29. Thondup said Dalai
                        Lama is anxious keep Tibetan issue alive and to forefront of world opinion;
                        sees no better way accomplish this than through <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate, though he recognizes <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debates and reses unlikely produce concrete results. Thondup
                        said Tibetans are, however, in somewhat of quandary as to how they best
                        proceed this year. On one hand, Tibetans own convictions re status of Tibet,
                        plus desire give hope and encouragement to people within Tibet, lead them to
                        prefer <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate which would end with res
                        recognizing political aspects of Tibetan problem through references to
                        self-determination and independence.</p>
                    <p>On other hand, Tibetans well aware of attitude of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> which, for two years, has assured Tibetans it willing give
                        full and active support to res emphasizing human rights aspects of Tibetan
                        problem. However, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has been very
                        hesitant, and is more so than ever at present moment, to support res
                        touching on political side of Tibetan problem. Would, therefore, appreciate
                        US advice.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> assured Thondup (and asked
                        that this be conveyed to Dalai Lama) that US Govt and people deeply
                        concerned re plight of Tibetan <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0769"/>people, recognize Tibetan problem has both human rights and political
                        aspects, and prepared support appropriate res touching on both.
                        Nevertheless, must recognize that Afro-Asian attitude has been disappointing
                        this year in many respects (e.g. ChiRep vote and inscription of Tibetan
                        item); Africans are unusually preoccupied with problems of own continent;
                        and many <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>s seem anxious avoid taking stand
                        on issues which entail degree of confrontation with Communist China.</p>
                    <p>In planning strategy, therefore, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said care must be exercised not to seek res which
                        would fail to carry or carry with only weak vote. Attitude of Asian states
                        with sizeable Buddhist populations of central importance. This particularly
                        true of India, partly because of its positions in <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> world, partly because it is closest to and has most intimate
                        knowledge of Tibetan problem. It is unlikely that at present time many
                            <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>s willing go much further on Tibetan
                        res than Indians prepared to lead.</p>
                    <p>Thondup said US support and help with other delegations will be essential for
                        any res. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said US, of course,
                        would render appropriate help but reiterated view that essential thing for
                        Tibetans is to get active support of Indians and other Asians. MisOff added
                        that US help, if too obvious, would tend damage rather than improve
                        prospects for good vote because it would lend credence to those who contend
                        Tibetan item is essentially US-inspired “cold-war" item.<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Telegram 1412 to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>,
                            December 6, stated that while the Department had been concerned that
                            “too active" lobbying on the Tibet item might be disadvantageous,
                            additional effort might be desirable to overcome “apparent apathy
                            enveloping item in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.” It instructed
                                <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> to broaden its approaches to
                            Western European and African delegations and to include such delegations
                            as Jordan and Iran. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Thondup then presented us with text of draft res which, he said, was drafted
                        by Tibetans in New Delhi and approved by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        (text which Thondup has not yet discussed with Phils and other co-sponsors,
                        sent septel). Thondup expressed concern that res might be interpreted as
                        retreat from 1961 res. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said
                        it did not appear to be retreat since it reaffirmed both previous reses in
                        preamble, and spoke of “denial of the fundamental freedom" which Tibetans
                        have always enjoyed in operative section.</p>
                    <p>After leaving <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, Thondup told
                        MisOff he was assured in New Delhi that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        would instruct its <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> del to give “full and
                        active support" to this res, including speech in debate and promoting
                        support among other dels. Thondup said Indian Mission confirmed receipt of
                        such instructions earlier in day.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> said that the Indian attitude regarding the
                        Tibetan question had changed, and, largely because of India's new situation
                        vis-a-vis Communist China, India was now being more forthcoming and helpful.
                        However, the difficulty was that India was weak militarily and hard-pressed,
                        and therefore, reluctant to be truly forthcoming. They were supporting,
                        although not sponsoring, the human rights resolution on Tibet now before the
                        General Assembly. What the Tibetans wanted was support in a political sense
                        and to have a case made for their political freedom. For instance, when
                        approached for support, the Afro-Asians asked what the Tibetans really
                        gained from a resolution on human rights. The Afro-Asians felt that a
                        political resolution looking to independence was what was needed, a
                        resolution dealing with fundamental freedom for Tibet. However, the Indians
                        were unwilling to take this step and the current resolution, which was first
                        aimed at fundamental freedom, was watered down at their insistence to
                        fundamental freedoms. Prime Minister Shastri and the majority of his
                        ministers as well as the Indian people were for the Tibetan cause. But in
                        their present situation, they were not ready to take a position of
                        leadership. They needed to be urged by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> wished to pass on to Mr.
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> the Dalai Lama's request that the U.S.
                        re-examine its position and encourage India to take a political, rather than
                        a purely humanitarian position regarding Tibet. Mr.
                            <persName>Thondup</persName> went on to say that for Communist China
                        Tibet was a weak spot militarily, spiritually, and morally. He felt that the
                        U.S. had a right to ask for a stronger Indian position and hoped that
                        Ambassador Bowles might take this up with Prime Minister Shastri. The
                        near-term objective was to establish a government-in-exile under the Dalai
                        Lama in India.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that Taiwan posed something of a
                        problem for us. It was not a question that Taiwan's influence with us was
                        strong, but it <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0771"/>was a factor that we
                        must consider. Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> felt that the Nationalist
                        Chinese should take a more progressive attitude, but in talking to them he
                        found them difficult and hampered by a hundred years of tradition and the
                        present dominance of the conservative group. The younger officials were not
                        so hidebound, but the present Chi-Nat stance was that once they were back on
                        the Mainland, they would support self-determination for Tibet. There
                        followed a brief discussion of the status of Tibet in recent history,
                        whether it had been, in fact really independent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> said, in summary, that in future efforts it
                        was best to avoid the question of past independence and to rally support for
                        the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people in their independence struggle. He
                        made a strong plea for U.S. help as well as advice on how to pursue their
                        goals. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that the question of
                        government-in-exile was somewhat difficult for us at the present time,
                        because we had resisted all pressure for a Cuban Government-in-exile in this
                        country. He promised to discuss Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName>'s plea with
                        his colleagues who had been following Tibetan matters much more closely
                        recently than he and we would pass our considered view to him, most likely
                        through Ambassador Bowles.</p>

                                    consideration to Dalai Lama's views. We are particularly mindful
                                    of special attention which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                    has already devoted to problems of Tibetan refugees, when the

                                <item>Beyond this, as a practical matter, we feel that Dalai Lama
                                    should weigh all aspects of question before making any move this
                                    direction. Trying to look at it not only from our own angle but
                                    also from that of Indians and of Tibetans themselves, we see
                                    very little if any practical advantage deriving to anyone from
                                    such a change in status of Dalai Lama. either in terms of his

                            The source text bears no drafting information. A March 4 memorandum from
                            Battle to <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> describes it as

                            discussed at a March 19 meeting of the 303 Committee. According to

                            representative James Critchfield stated that “achievements inside Tibet
                            were minimal—outside more substantial.” He observed that “the Tibetans
                            by nature did not appear to be congenitally inclined toward
                            conspiratorial proficiency.” Jessup records no action by the 303

                            1956. The program consists of political action, propaganda, paramilitary
                            and intelligence operations, appropriately coordinated with and

                            <p>Appraisal of Current Programs—The cultural revolution in China
                                expanded into Tibet bringing with it tremendous disturbances
                                including the disruption of internal transportation, communication,
                                travel and, to a significant extent, peace and order. Unfortunately
                                there are no apparent signs that the Tibetan people are capitalizing
                                upon this internal chaos to seek further autonomy. Chinese security
                                has shown no signs of deterioration <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0774"/>and their control over Tibet, both political and
                                military, remains as pervasive as ever. Tibetan leadership has been
                                purged, leaving the Chinese in direct control of the local
                                administration, and a large number of underground assets have been
                                uncovered and neutralized.</p>
                            <p>The Tibetan program has a potential for operational success based on
                                a reservoir of trained agent material, the location in a safe-haven
                                of the Dalai Lama together with the nucleus of new young leaders,
                                widespread sympathy for the Tibetan cause, indications of a more
                                positive Indian attitude toward the political aspirations of the
                                Tibetan government, and evidence of considerable disarray among the

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> stated that he had been instructed by
                            His Holiness the Dalai Lama to express His Holiness' gratitude to the
                            United States Government for its assistance to Tibetan
                            refugees—specifically the surplus food and the monetary assistance. Mr.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> replied that we appreciate this message
                            deeply, and that Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> can assure His
                            Holiness that we will not forget the plight of the Tibetans.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> said he had another matter to take
                            up. He said it would be very essential and useful if India would take
                            the initiative in the United Nations on a resolution concerning Tibet.
                            He said he has been trying to convince India that it is in its own
                            interest, as well as in the interest of the people of Tibet, to do this.
                            The Indians, he said, are afraid of the Chinese Communists. His
                            Holiness, he said, feels that US indirect encouragement to India to take
                            the initiative on a resolution would be helpful and His Holiness asks
                            the advice and help of the United States on this subject. Mr.
                                <persName>Thondup</persName> said that the Tibetan people still want
                            to fight the Chinese Communists and that Tibet, “a small nation,” is
                            very dependent on large nations to keep the issue alive. Whatever the
                            United States can do would help a small people's struggle for
                            independence.</item>

                            Delhi earlier this year. He said that he will ask the views of the

                            resolution but that India has its own policy and may not respond to

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> said that he is afraid of the Soviet

                            also. In 1959 the Soviet Union was bitterly opposed to the resolution
                            and has voted against such resolutions all along, but since last year he
                            thinks the Soviet Union has shown a slight change. He <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0778"/>has had private meetings with Soviet
                            officials and was told that “Tibet and Sinkiang are not the interest of

                            that we seek to bring the Chinese Communists into the family of nations
                            but that we would not make any accommodation with the Chinese Communists

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> stated that there are nearly 900
                            Tibetan students in Europe and that a visit of His Holiness to Europe is
                            being planned. American friends, he said, always ask why he does not
                            come to the United States. Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> said he did
                            not know the reaction of the United States to a private visit of His
                            Holiness to this country. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said he would
                            have to inquire and added that this would be a matter for the new
                            Administration. Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> commented that His
                            Holiness is not an ordinary visitor and would have to make a courtesy
                            call on the President. He expressed his gratitude to Mr.

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> commented at some length on events in
                            Tibet. He said the situation now is “quite quiet" since the
                            establishment of the Revolutionary Committee for Tibet in September. Two
                            rival organizations are fighting each other and pressing Tibetans to
                            join. The Tibetans, however, are taking a neutral position. There are
                            many killings of Chinese by other Chinese. The Cultural Revolution has
                            affected many military leaders in Tibet. Many have been dismissed; many
                            are new. There is new leadership among the military and in the Party.
                            The Chinese have purged all Tibetan collaborators. Some were killed,
                            some were imprisoned, and some were tortured and released. The elderly
                            people hate the Chinese, and the younger people are now bitter because
                            all important posts are occupied by Chinese, not Tibetans. The Tibetans
                            want to fight, but this is a very wrong position. Events of 1959 are an
                            example. It is only suicide to fight the Chinese.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Thondup</persName> said the Chinese system in Tibet is a
                            complete failure. The six million (sic) people in Tibet are not
                            convinced the Chinese are doing anything for them. It is very hard for
                            the Chinese to get used to the altitude and the type of food available
                            in Tibet. There are food shortages because of the difficulty of bringing
                            food long distances to Tibet. The Chinese bring in military and other
                            supplies instead. The Chinese troops do not want to stay in Tibet</item>

                    <p>As to timing, it is extremely important that the step be taken as soon as
                        possible (preferably before the end of June) to avoid an adverse effect on
                        the Chinese representation position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        and in any disarmament conference that may be called. Recent soundings by
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Marshall Green</persName> at our Embassy in
                        Taipei and current conversations here with Taipei's <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CRN1">Ralph Clough</persName> indicate that now is
                        probably the best time, as far as our relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are concerned, to recognize Outer Mongolia.
                        Our firm policy in Viet-Nam should allay any <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fears that U.S. policy is softening, and the intelligence
                        requirements dramatized by Communist China's second nuclear explosion are
                        self-evident.</p>
                    <p>The Russians may be less inclined right now to be forthcoming about transit
                        rights, but the virulence of the Chinese Communist attack upon them should
                        stiffen their back and perhaps cause them fairly shortly to be seeking some
                        indirect means to riposte. If our assumptions are correct, the Mongols will
                        be urging the Russians to cooperate, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> perhaps is not presently in the best position to deny
                        favors to the Mongols. In November 1964 the British established a mission in
                        Ulan Bator, and the French have recently recognized Outer Mongolia, so we
                        are not breaking new ground.</p>
                    <p>Our generalized interest in self-determination argues that we recognize Outer
                        Mongolia. To this may be added certain specific arguments. If negotiations

                    <p>Even if they did not lead to recognition, negotiations with the Mongols would
                        yield us certain advantages. We would gain a better reading of

                            recognition by US would be an act undermining <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s basic position. He said that closeness of US–<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations meant that any US recognition
                            would have a more serious impact on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            than recognition by Australia, for instance. Australia is a “new friend"

                            any decision on recognition, and that we wished at this stage only to
                            place before President <persName>Chiang</persName>, and seek his
                            reaction to, some of the possible advantages we think might accrue to US
                            if we should open an Embassy in Ulan Bator. I said that my instructions
                            were to seek the Gimo's views, and that I still wished if possible to
                            have opportunity to do so, but that of course it would be up to Gimo
                            whether he wished to receive me on this subject. I noted that in view of
                            known high importance <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attaches to
                            entire subject of Outer Mongolia, it would seem appropriate for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reaction to be conveyed to US at
                            highest level. I said there was no great urgency about appointment, and
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>was not on the brink of any
                            quick decision, so that I could afford to wait until Gimo might have

                            any advantage from Embassy in Ulan Bator. He said Sovs would not permit

                            ChiCom nuclear or missile tests. I confined myself to saying that <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> perhaps not aware of
                            technological advances which might in fact enable us to obtain valuable

                            September 1965 during his Washington visit. He said that while the
                            matter was outside of his sphere of authority he would like to know of
                            US view of relations between Outer Mongolia and ChiComs.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I said we had little independent information, but that Outer Mongolia
                            seemed to be following anti-ChiCom stance similar to Soviets. Soviet
                            influence was apparently strong, but Mongolia should not necessarily be
                            considered merely their puppet. I recalled that Mongolians had recently
                            reviewed alleged 1921 Chinese interference in Outer Mongolia, and I said
                            we had information that Soviet <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s
                            installed near Ulan Bator. I said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>had
                            reached no decision on recognition, was keeping an open mind, but that I
                            had instructions see Gimo to get his views directly, as well as to
                            convey to him our thoughts on certain advantages possibly to be derived
                            from having an Embassy there. I said <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> had conveyed to me that Gimo is very busy, but I had
                            renewed my request for an appointment with Gimo because of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>desire to give full consideration to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> views, and because I knew that

                        <item>In obviously prepared reminiscences, he spoke of origin of Sino Sov
                            Treaty of 1945, which was result, he said, of agreements at Yalta which
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had not been party to. He said
                            that during negotiations on that treaty he himself had spoken to Stalin,
                            who said that an Outer Mongolia under influence other than Soviet would
                            be threat to security of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Stalin
                            had also promised that there would be 30 years of peace in the area if
                            Soviet proposals accepted by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and
                            that Soviets would not support ChiComs against ChiNats. (His intention
                            was to say that Soviets not to be trusted.) He then referred to his
                            third trip to Moscow in fall of 1945 to talk about an economic agreement
                            privileges in Manchuria, not to be accorded to any other country. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> had discussed this provision with Gimo,
                            who had refused to sign, noting that treaty would have excluded US from
                            economic opportunities in Manchuria. (His intention here was to say that
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had protected US interests at
                            that time.) He recalled that shortly afterwards in November Lin Piao's
                            troops had begun attacking Mukden and Changchun, in violation of
                            agreements.</item>

                            recognition of Outer Mongolia would be on “moral" grounds rather than on
                            legal grounds, since <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss> officers
                            recognize that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> abrogation of
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty after it was in force for eight years cannot from

                            of Outer Mongolia. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> did place
                            some emphasis on “territorial integrity" of Outer Mongolia, but major
                            emphasis seemed to be on requesting <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>not to undermine position of close ally. <gloss target="#t_CCK1">CCK</gloss> has implied that past <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> actions in support of US interests

                        <item>I am not sure whether my rather strong representations for appointment

                            again rejected, I would take it to mean that Gimo feels he already has

                                continue to be vigorous. In March 1967 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> mentioned directly to
                                President <persName>Chiang</persName> the intelligence aspect of our

                                Government's strong opposition to recognition of Mongolia by the US.
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> this
                                month has reassessed the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                attitude (Taipei 3177 at Tab C).<note n="4" xml:id="d347fn4">Telegram 3177 from Taipei, May 22; not printed.</note> Although
                                he recommends, from the standpoint of “best nourishment of our

                                any move toward recognition, he believes that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reaction now would be substantially
                                that which he anticipated a year ago. We therefore conclude that
                                recognition of Mongolia will create strains in our relations but
                                that these strains will be largely temporary in nature and
                                manageable in degree. Our actions over the past few years have
                                probably conditioned Taipei to accept the inevitability of eventual
                                US recognition of Mongolia, and the record shows we have given every
                                consideration to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> views.
                                Moreover, unlike 1961, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will
                                not need to take any positive action suggesting acquiescence in our
