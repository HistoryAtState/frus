                <p>The Department of State released today <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the
                        United States,</hi> 1969-1976, Volume E–4, Documents on Iran and Iraq,
                    1969-1972, as an electronic-only publication. This volume is the latest
                    publication in the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series that documents the most important decisions and actions of the foreign
                    policy of the administrations of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                        Nixon</persName> and Gerald Ford. Volume E–4 is the fifth <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in this new format. It is
                    available to all free of charge on the Internet. Approximately 25 percent of the
                    volumes scheduled for publication for the 1969-1976 subseries, covering the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-Ford administrations, will be in this format.</p>
                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration towards its then staunch friend in the
                    Middle East, Iran under the Shah. It also documents limited U.S. relations with
                    a potential opponent, increasingly pro-Soviet Iraq. Since Iran and Iraq were
                    rivals, the closer the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration's ties were to Tehran the wider the gap became with Baghdad.</p>
                <p>U.S. relations with Iran had been close since the early 1950's, but the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration saw in the Shah and Iran a
                    key oil,–rich ally able to further U.S. interests in the area, and a pillar of
                    security in the Persian Gulf. The volume documents a debate between the
                    Departments of State and Defense over the question of how many modern weapons
                    the Shah required and how much of Iran's resources should go to defense as
                    opposed to social and economic development. The debate ended in May 1972 during
                    President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to Tehran, when
                    the President pledged to supply the Shah with virtually all available arms
                    except atomic weapons. To pay for these weapons, as well as the so—called “White
                    Revolution” to modernize Iran, the Shah needed higher oil prices. Pleased that
                    the Shah did not join the rest of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> in
                    demanding oil industry ownership, the United States was willing to accept his
                    independent efforts to control his nation's oil resources. The volume also
                    tracks the latent popular discontent at the Shah's rule for what his critics
                    charged was a corrupt, extravagant, and dictatorial regime. Although U.S.
                    Embassy officials reported that student protests and terrorist incidents had
                    increased, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration saw
                    no immediate threat to the Shah's stability. The President and other officials
                    believed that the Shah was a benign dictator whose rule best suited Iran's
                    current stage of development.</p>
                <p>The volume also documents less congenial U.S.–Iraqi relations, which had been
                    severed officially in 1967. With no presence in Baghdad, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration was hampered in handling
                    issues like the Ba'athist persecution of Iraqi Jews in 1969. Still,</p>
                <p>U.S. officials interpreted this and other events as a sign of the Ba'athists'
                    weakness, and initially resisted Iran's argument that Iraq constituted a danger.
                    The volume demonstrates that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration was guided by the apparent expectation that the Ba'athist regime
                    would fall on its own, beset by internal unrest from Iraq's armed Kurdish
                    minority. As the Ba'athists consolidated their power, however, their tilt
                    towards Moscow became a concern to Washington. In addition to welcoming Soviet
                    involvement in the Iraqi oil industry, the Iraqis signed a Treaty of Friendship
                    and Cooperation with Moscow in early 1972. A second theme emerges with the U.S.
                    perception of a threat from Baghdad. Alarmed at the increased Iraqi potential
                    for “trouble—making” in the Gulf, and eager to thwart Soviet acquisition of a
                    Middle East base, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed
                    in May 1972 to the Shah's long—standing appeal to join his assistance effort to
                    the Kurds. The volume shows that the goal of this covert assistance was to
                    prevent the Kurds from making peace with Baghdad, and keep the Iraqi government
                    too absorbed with internal instability to disturb its neighbors. US officials'
                    early assessments of support for the Kurds in Iraq deemed it a success.</p>

                <p rend="center">Foreign Relations, 1969–1972, Volume E–4, Iran and Iraq</p>
                <p>(This is not an official statement of policy by the Department of State, but is
                    intended only as a guide to the contents of this volume.)</p>
                <p>From 1969 to 1972, the United States viewed Iran as one of its staunchest friends
                    in the Middle East and Iraq as a potentially dangerous opponent. Since Iran and
                    Iraq were rivals, Washington's close ties to Tehran only widened the gap with
                    Baghdad. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>, like
                    previous U.S. Presidents, regarded Iran under Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi as a
                    stable pillar of U.S. security in the Middle East. The main point of contention
                    in congenial U.S.–Iranian relations was the Shah's appetite for expensive, but
                    unnecessary, high—technology weapons. Concerned that an arms build—up might
                    imperil Iranian internal stability by diverting funds for social efforts and
                    complicate regional relations, U.S. officials were torn between satisfying and
                    restraining the Shah. As for Iraq, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration viewed with suspicion if not hostility the
                    Iraqi Ba'athist regime, which had severed relations with the United States in
                    1967. Washington conducted its minimal dialogue with Baghdad through the Belgian
                    Embassy, acting through additional third parties when critical issues arose.
                    Unlike the government in Tehran, however, the Administration tended to regard
                    the Ba'athists as too fragmented and weak to pose a serious menace to the Gulf
                    region. Repeated anti—Ba'athist coup attempts reinforced this opinion.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's tilt toward
                    Tehran led to significant shifts in its policy toward Iran and Iraq in 1972.
                    First, the United States abandoned its sporadic efforts to rein in the Shah's
                    extravagant military spending. During his May 1972 visit to Tehran, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> promised to sell the Shah any American
                    arms (short of atomic weapons) that he desired. Second, at the same meeting, the
                    President conceded the Shah's point that Iraq, now a close Soviet ally, was a
                    security danger to the Gulf region. To help keep the Ba'athist regime
                    off—balance, the U. S. Government began to support the Iraqi Kurdish rebellion
                    under <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah Mustafa Barzani</persName> in July
                    1972. Although the Shah had funded <persName>Barzani</persName> for years,
                    Washington had resisted Kurdish appeals for aid on the principle of
                    non—interference in the internal affairs of other countries. After the Iraqis
                    signed a treaty with the Soviets in April 1972, however, U.S. officials
                    “particularly in the Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>)”agreed that the threat from Baghdad warranted U.S.
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Iran</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Like the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> administration before it,
                    the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House believed from the
                    outset that Iran's role in the alliance system, particularly its strategic
                    position in the Persian Gulf, justified U.S. arms sales to Tehran. Policymakers
                    considered the $100 million per year, six—year military agreement that <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had signed with the Shah in 1968 to be
                    the "touchstone" of the U.S.–Iranian relationship, which provided Washington
                    with vital political and security privileges. (10) The country team at the
                    Embassy in Iran—mindful of the Iranian—based U.S.
                    intelligencefacilities—warnedof dire consequences for U.S. influence in Iran if
                    the Shah were thwarted. (57, 63, 78, 85) If the United States failed to supply
                    the weapons the Shah desired, he would obtain them elsewhere. (26, 55, 86, 182)
                    Moreover, Iranian purchases improved the U.S. balance of payments position,
                    since Washington was shifting military aid to Tehran from a grant to a credit
                    basis. (13)</p>
                <p>Yet policymakers also recognized that the Shah's arms build—up could threaten
                    stability, both within Iran and in the Gulf region. The Shah was quick to defend
                    his military requests by raising the specter of expanding Soviet influence
                    through radical Arab regimes like Iraq. (1, 24, 53, 69) The danger would become
                    acute once the British withdrew from the Persian Gulf in 1971, he claimed, and
                    Iran assumed responsibility for insuring regional security. (35, 185, 186, 67)
                    While <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration officials
                    recognized that Iran was the preponderant power in the Gulf, however, they saw
                    the regional threat as less dire and believed that Persian Gulf security should
                    depend upon joint Iranian and Saudi Arabian cooperation. (70, 75, 91, 97)
                    Department of Defense officials were particularly outspoken in their view that
                    there was little military justification for much of the equipment the Shah
                    sought. (29, 60, 61, 88)</p>
                <p>Department of State officials reconciled the arguments for and against arms sales
                    by contending that supplying Iran's military program was the best way to control
                    it. If the Shah trusted U.S. concern for Iranian security, military advisors
                    could then counsel him to establish priorities and eliminate wasteful spending.
                    (96, 99, 122) Nevertheless, a 1972 Department of State Intelligence and Research
                        (<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>) study acknowledged the inefficacy of
                    this strategy: "There is little evidence that [the Shah] pays much heed to any
                    efforts on the part of ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> [U.S. Army
                    Mission in Iran/Military Assistance Advisory Group] to influence the scope of
                    his armament efforts or his concept of what Iran needs” [H]e has moved from a
                    position of some dependence on his American advisers to one which sees them
                    largely as a reliable and helpful channel to his American suppliers.” (166)</p>
                <p>To finance the type of military he envisioned, the Shah required ever—increasing
                    oil revenues, and appealed for U.S. support in his battles with the western oil
                    consortium that lifted Iranian oil. In 1969, the Shah began to threaten
                    unilateral legislation to achieve an extra $100 million in oil revenue over the
                    consortium's planned $900 million off take, invoking the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> principle that mineral resources belong to countries rather than
                    to the foreign companies that exploit them. (3) Emphasizing that the U.S.
                    Government did not control the American oil companies, U.S. officials declined
                    to intervene, and the consortium secured a favorable deal that year. (4, 16, 17)
                    Still determined to solicit Washington's help, the Shah planned to broach the
                    issues of oil and Iran's military requirements in his first State visit with
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in October 1969. (24, 25,

                <p>On the eve of the Shah's visit, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName> sent the President and Secretary of Defense
                        <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Melvin Laird</persName> two memoranda that
                    highlighted conflicting U.S. impulses towards Iran's defense program. To
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> described the traditional U.S. policy towards the Shah's
                    military program as an attempt "to contain the Shah's military appetite, without
                    creating a negative impression, since the need for so much additional equipment
                    is questionable in our view and its purchase diverts resources from
                    development.” (27) U.S. officials recognized that despite Iranian economic
                    progress, exploding military expenditures might depress living standards and
                    arouse popular discontent. (10, 13, 117) Simultaneously, however, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> the importance of conveying to the Shah
                    "the clear impression that we are making a determined effort to help him to
                    continue to meet his defense needs.” (28) In essence, U.S. officials were not
                    willing to risk good relations with Iran for the sake of a more prudent arms
                    policy.</p>
                <p>In his meetings in Washington, the Shah proposed that United States import a
                    large quota of oil from Iran, the proceeds of which he pledged to spend within
                    the United States on military equipment. (25, 32, 33) For his prized air force,
                    the Shah sought two additional squadrons of F–4 Phantom fighter—bomber aircraft,
                    along with pilot training and U.S. air force technicians. (35, 37) Stretched
                    thin by the Vietnam War, the administration initially could comply only on the
                    question of pilot training. (30, 49) The Shah, however, encouraged by officials'
                    expressions of general support, pursued his objectives of oil income, F–4s, and
                    technicians in subsequent discussions with American officials. (46, 67, 73)</p>
                <p>Although the Shah left Washington convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had vowed to order the oil companies to purchase more
                    Iranian oil, the administration was willing only to encourage the consortium to
                    provide the Shah with higher revenues. (44, 45, 51, 54) Disappointed, the
                    Iranian leader renewed his threat of a legislative solution to the oil problem,
                    leading President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to warn the oil
                    companies in October 1970 that American security was at stake in the
                    negotiations. (89) By December, a satisfactory arrangement had, for the moment,
                    been reached, but it was soon overtaken by an Organization of Petroleum
                    Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>) decision to increase
                    oil prices, with Iran leading the charge. (101,108)</p>
                <p>The Department of Defense remained concerned that Iran was acquiring arms beyond
                    its needs and absorptive capacity, but its reservations were ignored. (61, 82,
                    90) To relieve the annual tension over military sales, in April 1970 the
                    President approved a plan to stretch out the 1968 military agreement over 7 or 8
                    years, thereby extending the U.S. commitment as Iran's arms supplier. (57, 60,
                    62, 64) In August 1970, when Congress delayed approval of the foreign military
                    sales financing, Washington provided the Shah with $120 million in Export—Import
                    bank credits, $20 million above the $100 million annual military credit. (48,
                    74, 83) Despite Defense opposition, State and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> argued for the proposal that the Shah be allowed to use the
                    credit for the F–4 aircraft, which he felt <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had promised him during his Washington visit. (85, 88, 90,
                    93) After considerable debate, the White House sided with State. (103, 107) As
                    Iran splurged on a lavish 2500th anniversary celebration of the Persian monarchy
                    in October 1971, the United States still provided Tehran grant military training
                    in addition to the military credit, which was raised to $140 million in 1972.
                    (133, 134, 160, 173)</p>
                <p>Washington officials had not entirely abandoned hope of using their advisory role
                    to check the Shah's excesses. The Shah, however, disregarded State's advice to
                    purchase only necessary jet aircraft appropriate to the regional balance of
                    power. (55, 106, 156) U.S. officials still took some satisfaction when, on the
                        <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s advice, the Shah reduced the number
                    of F–4s needed for accelerated delivery from 16 to 8 aircraft. (169, 172, 174)
                    Moreover, to operate the new F–4s, the air force technical assistance team in
                    Iran extended its stay through 1974. (154) In 1972, as the Shah requested, the
                    military advisory group was expanded by 36, despite the Defense and
                    Congressional mandate to reduce <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> sizes
                    worldwide. (79, 177) Defense objections notwithstanding, the administration also
                    allowed Major General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Hamilton Twitchell</persName>
                    to accept contract employment as advisor to Tehran upon his retirement as Chief
                    of ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, believing that <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> would direct Iranian military
                    purchasing toward American suppliers. (135, 143, 149)</p>
                <p>As a friend of the Shah, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    placed great stress on Iran's role in the Persian Gulf. If he regarded the
                    Shah's more grandiose regional ambitions with skepticism, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> accepted the Shah's claim that Iran was
                    the only dependable U.S. ally between Europe and Japan. (75, 122) While
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> had emphasized the importance
                    of shoring up the regime's internal position with a broad reform program, the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration believed that
                    the Shah's "White Revolution" had been successful, despite the regime's narrow
                    base and dependence on the army and security services. The President and other
                    officials believed that Iran was not prepared for constitutional democracy and,
                    at its current stage of development, was best served by a benign dictatorship, a
                    view the Embassy in Iran corroborated. (1, 122, 181) So long as an apparently
                    steady and strong Shah directed a growing economy and an expansive foreign
                    policy, all was well in Iran. (183, 185) U.S. officials responded warmly to the
                    Iranian leader's claim that his "independent nationalism" of self—reliance and
                    self—defense dovetailed with the Nixon Doctrine of letting friends defend
                    themselves. (23, 123, 197)</p>
                <p>There were signs, however, that all was not well in Iran. The Shah's territorial
                    claims in the Gulf, which the United States tended to support, irritated
                    Arab—Iranian relations. (75, 119, 146, 155) Americans in Iran also remarked on
                    the quickened tempo of Iranian student protests and terrorist incidents,
                    including a 1970 assassination attempt on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">Douglas MacArthur II</persName>. (50, 84, 102, 126) Yet
                    given the tumult at home during the Vietnam War, the administration was
                    relatively inured to student protest. (84, 122) Wary of expanding Soviet
                    influence, many American observers accepted Tehran's claim that forces outside
                    Iran were directing a small Iranian minority engaged in anti—government
                    subversion. (126, 127, 144) A wide audience within Iran, however, revered the
                    regime's opponents, such as exiled religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
                    (76, 181)</p>
                <p>The Shah's relationship with Washington was itself a source of grievance for many
                    Iranians, and by occasionally striking an anti—American pose, the Shah answered
                    his critics. In several 1972 press statements, the Shah condemned the U.S.
                        <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> [Middle East Forces] naval
                    presence in Bahrain, excusing his outbursts to U.S. officials privately as a
                    public relations gesture. U.S. observers also theorized that the Shah was
                    attempting to place himself on record as opposing any external powers in the
                    Gulf in order to counter a future Soviet presence. (161, 162, 164, 165) The
                    Shah's disapproval of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>,
                    however, was genuine. (105, 165, 206) To express displeasure with Washington's
                    policy towards anti–Shah protestors in the United States, the Shah allowed a
                    former student on the government news outlets to accuse American organizations
                    of collaborating with anti—Iranian student groups in the United States. (130,
                    131, 132) The Shah also attempted to relieve one of the major sources of Middle
                    East strife and U.S. unpopularity, the Arab—Israeli struggle. However, he
                    received only non—committal replies to his urging that the U.S. Government
                    pressure Israel to accept an Arab—Israeli peace settlement. (124, 128, 129)</p>
                <p>Where U.S. and Iranian interests conflicted, as on the issue of narcotics,
                    Washington found Tehran intractable. The Shah rejected the U.S. request for help
                    in controlling opium production, which Tehran resumed in 1969 after a 14–year
                    hiatus. Many Iranian dissidents accused the Shah's family of complicity in the
                    drug trade itself. (178, 179, 180, 187) Still, American officials declined to
                    pursue the matter with the Shah, allowing that Iran was a "victim" country of
                    the drug trade because of its high number of users, and convinced that Iran
                    would not export opium, despite some evidence to the contrary. (136, 192, 218,
                    221) As in other fields, American officials inclined towards optimistic analyses
                    of Iran's drug policies. When Tehran pledged to reduce the authorized poppy
                    cultivation of 1973 to 10 per cent of the 1972 level, American officials
                    celebrated. (222)</p>
                <p>From the U.S. perspective, the practical value of the relationship outweighed its
                    drawbacks. Iran could be a useful friend, as in 1972 when the Iranians responded
                    to a U.S. plea to turn over their entire force of F–5A's to South Vietnamese
                    forces in operation "Enhance Plus.” (223) Yet the Shah drove a hard bargain for
                    his aid, providing only 32 of the 90 aircraft requested, and insisting that more
                    advanced aircraft replace those he had surrendered. (225, 226, 227, 228) While
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Joseph Farland</persName> supported the
                    Shah's demands, Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis
                        Johnson</persName> dragged his feet, prompting the President's National
                    Security Advisor <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> to
                    intervene with a compensation package that exceeded the ambassador's
                    recommendations. (231, 232, 234, 235)</p>
                <p>The U.S. Government was similarly willing to pay a high price for even a
                    semblance of Iranian moderation over the issue of oil. In late 1970, the Shah
                    rejected U.S. appeals on behalf of the oil companies, and called for higher oil
                    prices for the Persian Gulf countries of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>,
                    based on the threat of cutbacks. (109) In January 1971, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> dispatched Under Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">John Irwin</persName> to Tehran as
                    intermediary in the crisis, but <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>
                    and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">Douglas MacArthur II</persName>
                    quickly adopted the Shah's position that the consortium should negotiate a
                    separate Persian Gulf agreement rather than the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>–wide deal the consortium preferred. (110, 111, 112) Signed in
                    February 1971, the Persian Gulf agreement with Iran left the oil consortium
                    vulnerable to successive rounds of price rises, or "leap—frogging,” as the Gulf
                    producers and other <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members competed for
                    the best terms. (115, 125, 139)</p>
                <p>As negotiations heated up in 1972 over the critical issue of the participation of
                    producing countries in the oil industry, Americans persisted in regarding Iran
                    as a stalwart of moderation, despite the Shah's own far—reaching ambitions for
                    control of Iran's oil resources. (141, 157, 199) Although the Shah did not
                    insist on the 20 percent industry ownership that some Arab producers then
                    demanded, he asked the consortium for higher oil income and aid for Iran's
                    national oil company and refinery. In return, the Shah undertook to extend the
                    consortium's oil agreement beyond the current 1979 expiration date. (199, 207)
                    Pleased at the promise of stability and at Iranian independence from <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, the President sent the Shah a congratulatory
                    note on the negotiations, and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    termed the agreement "tough but responsible.” (208, 209) The Shah, however, was
                    aghast when Saudi Arabia won more generous participation terms for itself and
                    certain other <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> Gulf producers, complaining
                    that this settlement undercut moderate forces like himself by offering greater
                    rewards to extremists. He promptly insisted that his own agreement be revised,
                    either by raising Iranian revenues to the Saudi level, or by transferring
                    significant industry control to the Iranians in a long—term contract. (237) His
                    demands seemed in no way to dent his reputation for moderation within the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Shah felt that the United States took him for granted since Iran was
                    not a hotbed of instability. (184) By 1972, responding to the Shah's
                    increasingly strident reminders about <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s long—deferred visit, the White House arranged a
                    Presidential trip to Tehran to affirm the Shah's special relationship with the
                    United States and acknowledge his concerns over Soviet regional objectives.
                    (158, 159, 197) Since the Shah was likely to raise his pet topic of military
                    cooperation, the Embassy and Rogers counseled the President to assure the Shah
                    that Washington viewed Iran as "an outstanding example of national independence
                    and self—reliance, that we value our close relationship highly, and that we have
                    every intention of continuing to cooperate with it,” while also urging Iran to
                    work closely with its anti—Soviet neighbors. (188, 193) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that the President offer
                    the Shah F–4 and F–5E aircraft, avoid commitment on F–14 and F–15s, and reject
                    the sale of laser—guided bombs. (190, 197)</p>
                <p>During the May 1972 meetings with the Shah in Tehran, however, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made two commitments of far—reaching
                    importance. (200, 201) First, contrary to his advisors' counsel, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed to provide laser bombs, F–14 and
                    F–15 aircraft, and more air force technicians––in short, "all available
                    sophisticated weapons short of the atomic bomb.” (204, 205, 210, 215) The second
                    commitment was to aid the Iraqi Kurds (see Iraq section, below). <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s response represented the
                    administration's new position that, as Kissinger phrased it, "it is not repeat
                    not our policy to discourage Iranian arms purchases" and prevent Iranian
                    overbuying, which merely sent the Shah elsewhere to the detriment of U.S.
                    suppliers. Instead, "decisions as to desirability of equipment acquisition
                    should be left in the hands of the Iranian Government and the United States
                    should not undertake to discourage on economic grounds.” (211, 213) Despite
                    Iran's enhanced oil income, American officials recognized that the Shah was
                    likely to persist in deficit spending. In 1972, the Iranian military budget
                    totaled $1,023 million, 22 percent of the total budget and 10 percent of the
                        <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, and was expected to rise to 25 percent
                    of the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> by 1975 if spending patterns
                    continued. (117, 166, 167) Although U.S. officials believed that Iran could
                    afford both guns and butter, many alienated Iranians sharply disagreed.</p>
                <p>During <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s trip to Tehran, opponents
                    of the Shah orchestrated a bombing campaign that the Embassy believed was the
                    result of "a violence—inclined “youth underground' [that] has taken root in Iran
                    with possibly serious consequences for the country's long—term stability.”
                    Violent protests and demonstrations followed. While these dissidents posed a
                    disproportionate threat, however, officials did not judge them an immediate
                    danger to state security. (203) By August 1972, the Embassy reported that
                    despite a government crackdown, terrorist activity was unlikely to abate in the
                    absence of major political, social, and administrative reforms. (216) Iranian
                    observers, moreover, were less sanguine than Americans that the attacks
                    constituted no decisive threat, accusing the Iranian Intelligence and Security
                    Organization of the Country, <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>, of fueling
                    anti–Shah opposition to dangerous levels. One journalist dated the spate of
                    terrorist incidents to the harsh <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>
                    crackdown on students protesting the 1970 bus fare hike, many of whom had been
                    beaten, expelled, and left without future recourse. (50, 219) Moreover, the
                    chairman of a U.S.–based dissident organization, the Iran Free Press, warned
                    Washington that revolution was near, and that "it is a clear moral wrong for the
                    United States or any other party to advise Shah Pahlavi to spend hard earned
                    exchange currency on weapons, unneeded and ludicrously expensive, to guide his
                    choice, and moreover to back this choice with personnel, when most families in
                    Iran must survive on less than two dollars per day.” (224) Regarding the
                    author's organization as offensive, White House officials did not reply to this
                    letter. From the administration's perspective, despite the dissatisfaction of a
                    few, the Shah's position was fundamentally sound.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Washington's minimal relations with Iraq following the rupture with Baghdad
                    during the 1967 Arab—Israeli war were carried out by the Belgians. (7) With no
                    presence in Baghdad, the United States had little leverage. In 1969, when the
                    Ba'athist government evinced interest in the former U.S. Embassy property in
                    Baghdad "for security reasons,” the result was a foregone conclusion. Following
                    years of fruitless negotiations, the Iraqis seized the property in May 1971.
                    (10, 12, 45, 46) Along with the need for better reporting, this incident helped
                    inspire the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration to
                    establish an American—staffed Interest Section in the Belgian Embassy in Baghdad
                    in 1972, like that the Iraqis had established in Washington in 1967. (51, 64,
                    78)</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration confronted its
                    lack of influence in Iraq early in 1969 when it tried to prevent Israeli
                    retaliation on Baghdad for the public hanging of Iraqi Jews and others accused
                    of spying for Israel. (1) To mollify Tel Aviv, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> condemned the hangings in a statement
                    forwarded to the United Nations. (2, 3) U.S. officials also devised plans to
                    permit Iraqi Jews to immigrate to the United States, but, recognizing that
                    essential Iraqi cooperation would not be forthcoming if Washington were
                    involved, the Department of State discouraged Congressmen from proposing a
                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council meeting on the subject.
                    (5, 13) By October 1970, the Belgian Embassy reported that conditions had
                    improved for Iraqi Jews, although renewed reports of arrests of “migr”s in March
                    1971 prompted Washington to call for an inquiry by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner for Refugees. (32, 35, 37) The Commissioner,
                    along with other US allies to whom Washington appealed, successfully petitioned
                    Baghdad on behalf of Iraqi Jews, although the issue periodically resurfaced.
                    (38, 39, 72) American officials interpreted the ongoing persecution of Iraqi
                    Jews as an attempt to rally public support behind the Ba'athist regime by
                    playing up the military threat from Israel. According to <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>, internal political weakness had led the regime to launch its
                    spy executions. (8) Early on, US officials deemed the Baghdad government a trial
                    rather than a threat. </p>
                <p>This perception of Iraqi weakness guided U.S. policymakers for the first few
                    years of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s administration. Despite
                    the Shah's tendency to invoke the threat of attack or Soviet subversion from
                    Iraq, Washington remained unconvinced of Iraq's power to take action against
                    Iran, Iraq's reliability as a Soviet ally, or the Soviets' willingness to
                    sacrifice their relations with Tehran to those with Baghdad. (Iran 34,195; Iraq
                    23, 28) U.S. officials recognized that the Iraqis had been slow to implement
                    modern weaponry, and that although the Iraqi army could maintain internal
                    security and defend borders against the Arabs, it could not repel a Turkish or
                    Iranian attack. The Ba'athists' determination to subordinate the army had left
                    it in poor condition. (52, 63) Aware that the Soviets had built naval facilities
                    in the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, Washington also received intelligence on Soviet
                    disappointment with their Iraqi allies, who had failed to make peace with
                    Kurdish rebels in the north or pay installments on their loans from Moscow. (25,
                    26, 30, 34) Cessation of hostilities between the Ba'athists and the Kurdish
                    minority, U.S. officials recognized, could strengthen Iraq and free it to turn
                    to the Gulf. However, even after Baghdad signed a ceasefire agreement with the
                    Kurds in March 1970, the Ba'athists' reluctance to share power signaled that
                    Kurdish unrest would continue. (27, 29, 52, 65)</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding their distaste for the Ba'athists, U.S. officials saw little need
                    to aid the Kurds. Since 1969, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration had received pleas for help from Iraqi Kurdish leader <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah Mustafa Barzani</persName> for his uprising against
                    the Ba'athist government. U.S. officials rejected the overtures on grounds that
                    Washington would not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and
                    that an independent Kurdish state was not a U.S. goal. Officials also felt that,
                    regardless of Kurdish complaints of inadequate aid, the Kurds could get the help
                    they required from the Iranians and the Israelis. (14, 15, 22, 47) Both
                    countries had long supported <persName>Barzani</persName> in an effort to
                    destabilize their enemy in Baghdad. Throughout 1971, despite Barzani's
                    insistence that the Ba'athists could be toppled only by a Kurdish—led
                    insurrection, the United States maintained its refusal to assist. (47, 48)</p>
                <p>Washington probably expected the Ba'athist regime to fall on its own, perhaps
                    through an anti—Ba'athist coup. In August and December 1969, Iraqi “migr”s
                    unsuccessfully turned to the U.S. Government for support in their coup attempts.
                    (17, 18, 19) Another coup mounted by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>
                    with anti—Ba'athist elements failed in January 1970. (20, 52) U.S. officials
                    received news of a third coup planned for September 1970, led by Muhammad Ja'far
                    Al–Numayri, a Shi'a Muslim enraged by Sunni Muslim Ba'athist discrimination.
                    (31) American officials also followed the turmoil within the Ba'ath party
                    itself, which in October 1970 resulted in the dismissal of Defense Minister
                        <persName corresp="#p_THAAG1">HARDAN TIKRITI</persName> at the instigation
                    of <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">Saddam Hussein,</persName> Vice Chairman of the
                    Revolutionary Command Council. (33) Overall, U.S. officials judged Iraq to be
                    chronically unstable, fragmented, and erratic. (63)</p>
                <p>Even so, the regime seemed to be consolidating its power, and by 1971 some
                    American officials concluded that the Ba'athist government would be around for
                    some time, persistent economic woes and Kurdish discontent notwithstanding. (36,
                    41, 49, 63) Internal instability remained likely to prohibit the Ba'athists from
                    spreading their political influence abroad. Soviet influence in Iraq, however,
                    was growing, as evidenced in an agreement for $250 million in military equipment
                    and more in aid. Moscow seemed to be parlaying its investment in Iraq into a
                    platform from which to attain a position of ascendancy in the Middle East. (50,
                    52) To American alarm, <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSSEIN</persName> led
                    a delegation of Ba'ath officials to Moscow in February 1972, resulting in a
                    Soviet—Iraqi communiqu” and, later, a treaty. A precondition of the treaty was
                    the formation of a united front Iraqi Government, including communists and
                    Kurds. (53, 55)</p>
                <p>As the Soviets prodded <persName>Barzani</persName> to join a National Front
                    government, the Kurds again approached Washington through the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, insisting that without help, they would have
                    to come to terms with Baghdad. The Shah added his plea to
                        <persName>Barzani</persName>'s, warning that Iraq had fallen under Soviet
                    domination. Yet in March 1972, the White House, with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and State concurrence, declined the request once again,
                    repeating that Iran and Israel could provide for the Kurds, who were unlikely to
                    succeed in any case. The Americans were also reluctant to make a move that
                    Moscow could interpret as anti—Soviet. (54, 56, 57, 58) As late as April 1972,
                    the Department of State felt the balance of factors opposed Kurdish support,
                    arguing that Iraq's alliance with Moscow would endure a change of regime, and
                    that the leak of news of U.S. aid to the Kurds would damage U.S. relations with
                    the other Arab states. Further, aiding the Iraqi Kurds would give hope to Kurds
                    in Iran and Turkey of a separate Kurdistan, thus weakening those U.S. allies.
                    (59, 65)</p>
                <p>Soviet influence in Iraq, particularly in the oil industry, continued to expand.
                    In 1969, the Soviets had provided a $70 million loan for the development of
                    North Rumaila, the former Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) oil field whose concession Baghdad had unilaterally rescinded
                    in 1961. Moscow also agreed to supply the Iraqi—owned Iraq National Oil Company
                    with $72 million in oil exploration equipment. In all, the U.S.S.R. committed at
                    least $170 million to Iraq's oil industry. (9, 52, 62, 66) In April 1972, Soviet
                    Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Alexei Kosygin</persName> took part in
                    ceremonies marking the start of production in North Rumaila, which, to the
                    Department of State, "reflects the special Soviet effort to gain influence over
                    much of the Iraqi oil complex in order to assure the Soviets of alternative
                    sources of oil for their markets in Western and Eastern Europe.” (60)</p>
                <p>That same month, Baghdad and Moscow signed the anticipated Soviet—Iraqi "Treaty
                    of Friendship and Cooperation.” The treaty "symbolizes recent Soviet advances in
                    the area and reflects the considerable and increasing Soviet presence in Iraq.”
                    (60) Article Nine of the Treaty, promising cooperation in defense, hinted at an
                    enlarged Soviet military presence in Iraq with Gulf—based support facilities.
                    (63, 76) Promoting internal Iraqi stability for the sake of the Soviet
                    investment, the treaty provided American policymakers with cause for concern.
                    Iraq, U.S. officials thought, "has the potential for trouble—making in the Gulf
                    if it can adeptly use Soviet support, and the Soviets have greater prospects for
                    increasing their influence if they move cautiously.” (63)</p>
                <p>In talks with the Shah the following month in Tehran, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> promised to contribute to the Kurdish
                    effort to maintain independence from the Ba'ath. By aiding the Kurds, the
                    administration hoped to foster Iraqi instability and thwart Soviet establishment
                    of a Middle East base, as well as ensure the security of the Iranians,
                    Jordanians, and Israelis by tying up Iraqi forces. For Washington, achieving
                    these goals outweighed the risk of complicating the 1972 Moscow summit talks.
                    (71, 76) While shunning direct support for the Kurds, the United States pledged
                    to join a collaborative aid effort with the other interested regional parties.
                    (73)</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Baghdad appeared emboldened by Soviet support. On June 1, 1972, the
                    Iraqi Government nationalized all the assets of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> following a protracted dispute. After demanding a rise in oil
                    prices in April 1971, Baghdad threatened unilateral legislation or
                    nationalization the next month if the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> did
                    not sign an agreement to increase liftings, invest new capital, and settle old
                    claims. (40, 42) The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, seeking compensation
                    for the North Rumaila field, cut Iraq's share of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> member benefits. Baghdad consequently justified the
                    nationalization as compensation for back payments due from the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Americans speculated that Iraqis would
                    struggle to find oil markets, since the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                    companies controlled a significant share of the world market. Although the
                    Iraqis had already turned to the U.S.S.R. for help selling the oil, Washington
                    thought Moscow, itself an oil exporter, unlikely to assist. (66, 68)
                    Nonetheless, the Department of State determined to quietly support boycott
                    measures to ensure satisfactory compensation for the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, and try to isolate the Iraqi nationalization from Middle East
                    and <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> politics. (68, 70, 72, 76)</p>
                <p>In early June, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName> relayed a formal request on behalf of the Shah
                    that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> meet with two
                        <persName>Barzani</persName> representatives in Washington. The Shah
                    reminded Washington that the Kurds, pressed by the Soviets to make peace with
                    the Ba'athists, should be protected from Communist influence. (69, 74) Based on
                    his discussions with <persName>Barzani</persName>'s representatives, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> forwarded a proposal to the White House
                    for covert assistance to the Kurds on July 28. (74, 76) The President approved
                    the proposal for $3 million in financial assistance per year and $2 million in
                    military supplies; he agreed that the 40 Committee principals should be informed
                    but not meet on the subject. In the interest of maintaining plausible
                    deniability, aid would be funneled through other contributors to the operation.
                    The first progress report on the operation deemed it a success. (76, 77, 79) A
                    1972 <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> National Intelligence Estimate
                    examining Iraq's role in regional problems in the Middle East summed up the
                    American perspective on the Ba'athists: Iraq was friendly to the Soviets;
                    hostile to its neighbors, particularly Iran; cold to the Arab states; opposed to
                    Arab—Israeli peace; and hostile to the United States. (83) From the U.S.
                    perspective, the effort to destabilize such a troublesome power seemed
                    justified.</p>

                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President George H. W. Bush
                    on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory charter for the preparation of
                    the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department
                    of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.). </p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing
                    a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. </p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This electronic—only volume is part of the subseries of the Foreign Relations
                    series that documents the most important decisions and actions of the foreign
                    policy of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M.
                        Nixon</persName>. This is the fifth Foreign Relations volume to be published
                    in a new format, that of electronic—only publication. Approximately 25 percent
                    of the volumes scheduled for publication for the 1969-1976 subseries, covering
                    the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>–Ford administrations, will be in this format. The decision
                    to institute this change was taken in full consultation with the Department's
                    Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established
                    under the Foreign Relations statute. The advantages of this new method of
                    presenting documentation are evident in this volume: the format enables
                    convenient access to more key documentation on a broader range of issues, all or
                    any portion of which can be easily downloaded.Annotation—thevalue added element
                    of documentaryediting—isstill present in limited form, but not to the scale of a
                    Foreign Relations volume. This electronic—only publication results in
                    substantial savings in cost and time of production, thus allowing the series to
                    present a fuller range of documentation, on a wider range of topics, sooner than
                    would have been possible under a print—only format. These advantages compensate
                    for the fact that this Foreign Relations volume is not an actual book bound in
                    traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the Historian, the General
                    Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all dedicated to publishing
                    the great majority of the volumes in the Foreign Relations series in print form;
                    these are also posted in electronic format on the Department of State's website.
                    While the future of research in documentary publications is increasingly tied to
                    the ease of use and availability of the Internet, the Department of State will
                    continue to use both print and electronic—only versions to make the Foreign
                    Relations series available to the widest audience possible. In that sense, this
                    innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the series begun by
                    President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued by subsequent
                    presidents and secretaries of state for more than 140 years. </p>

                    Relations, 1969–1976, Volume E4</p>
                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration towards Iran and Iraq, 1969–1972, during a
                    period when the United States viewed Iran as its staunchest friend in the
                    Persian Gulf region and Iraq as a potentially dangerous opponent. Since Iran and
                    Iraq were rivals, Washington's increasingly close ties to Iran widened the gap
                    with Baghdad.</p>
                <p>Between 1969 and 1972, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White
                    House continued the policy of cultivating the Shah of Iran, a connection of
                    mutual benefit that provided the United States with a cooperative regional ally
                    and Iran with an arsenal for weapons purchases. Although the Department of
                    Defense was vocal in questioning Iran's need for so much weaponry, the U.S.
                    Embassy in Iran, the Department of State, and the Central Intelligence Agency
                    all warned that Washington would lose influence if it were to deny Iranian
                    requests. The volume demonstrates that the debate over whether to restrain
                    Iranian arms purchases ended in May 1972 during <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to Tehran, in which the President pledged to
                    supply the Shah with all available arms except atomic weapons.</p>
                <p>Another issue in U.S.–Iranian relations that the volume highlights was Iran's
                    demand for higher oil prices. The Shah required higher revenues from Iran's main
                    export for the expansive security role in the Persian Gulf that he envisioned
                    for his country. Washington rejected the Shah's proposal for the purchase of
                    Iranian oil by quota, but in early 1971, U.S. officials assisted the Shah in
                    striking a favorable deal with the Western consortium that extracted Iranian
                    oil. Pleased that the Shah did not join other <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members in demanding oil industry ownership, the United States
                    was willing to accept his independent efforts to control his nation's oil
                    resources.</p>
                <p>The volume also illustrates the theme of latent popular discontent with the
                    Shah's rule for what his critics charged was a corrupt, extravagant, and
                    dictatorial regime. Although U.S. officials recognized that the number of
                    student protests and terrorist incidents had escalated, the administration
                    perceived no immediate threat to the Shah's stability. Although aware that the
                    Shah's regime was narrowly based and dependent upon the army and the security
                    services, the President and other officials believed that the Shah's benign
                    dictatorship best suited Iran's current stage of development.</p>
                <p>The volume outlines less congenial U.S.“Iraqi relations, which had been severed
                    officially in 1967. With no presence in Baghdad, the United States was hindered
                    in handling issues like the Ba'athist persecution of Iraqi Jews in 1969. Still,
                    U.S. officials interpreted the crackdown and other events as a sign of the
                    Ba'athists' weakness, an effort to rally public support by playing up the
                    Israeli threat. Initially resistant to Iran's argument that Iraq constituted a
                    danger, the volume indicates that U.S. policymakers were guided by the apparent
                    expectation that the Ba'athist regime would fall on its own, beset by internal
                    unrest caused by Iraq's armed Kurdish minority. As the Ba'athists consolidated
                    their power, however, their tilt towards Moscow became a concern to Washington.
                    In addition to welcoming Soviet involvement in the Iraqi oil industry, the
                    Iraqis signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with Moscow in early
                    1972.</p>
                <p>A second theme emerges with the U.S. perception of a threat from Baghdad. Alarmed
                    at the increased Iraqi potential for “trouble—making” in the Gulf, and eager to
                    thwart Soviet acquisition of a Middle East base, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed in May 1972 to the Shah's longstanding appeal to
                    join his effort to assist the Kurds. The volume shows that the goal of the
                    covert assistance was to prevent the Kurds from making peace with Baghdad, and
                    keep the Iraqi Government too absorbed with internal instability to disturb its
                    neighbors. U.S. officials' early assessments of the Kurdish aid plan deemed it a
                    success.</p>

                    marginalia or other notations, which are both visible on the facsimile copy of
                    the document and described in the source note. There is also a text version of
                    the document. The editors have supplied a heading, a summary, and a source note
                    with additional relevant information, as required, for each document included in
                    the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in

                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text

                    subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is
                    blacked—out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type)
                    appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld
                    because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source
                    note, and a bracketed note indicating the number of pages not declassified.

                    U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has
                    custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                    historical materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations
                    govern access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                    historical materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations
                    require NARA to review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the
                    protection of the privacy rights of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House officials, since these officials were not
                    given the opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers.
                    Thus, the PRMPA and related implementing public access regulations require NARA
                    to notify formally the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> estate and
                    former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House staff members
                    that the agency is scheduling for public release <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House historical materials. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and former White House staff
                    members have 30 days to contest the release of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> historical materials in which they were a participant or
                    are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to
                    segregate and return to the creator of files private and personal materials. All
                    Foreign Relations volumes that include materials from NARA's <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Staff are

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information, and applicable laws. </p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The declassification review of
                    this volume, which began in 2004 and was completed in 2006, resulted in the
                    decision to withhold 4 documents in full, to excise a paragraph or more in 2
                    documents, and to make minor excisions in 21 documents. The editors are
                    confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this volume and
                    as a result of the declassification review process described above, that this
                    volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration towards Iran and Iraq,
                    1969–1972.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">NOTE</p>
                        <p>Over the past several years, Iran's hostility and suspicion towards the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has declined. Iran has
                            purchased some military equipment from Moscow, and economic relations
                            between the two countries continue to expand. In addition, with the
                            impending British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, Iran is vigorously
                            asserting its own claim to a leading position there, thus running afoul
                            of the aspirations of Saudi Arabia. In this estimate, we examine the
                            implications of these and related developments for US interests in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. The initial successes of the Shah's program of social reform—the
                            so-called "White Revolution"—and Iran's notable progress in economic
                            development have given the Shah considerably greater confidence that he
                            is master in his own house and considerably greater assurance in seeking
                            for Iran the position in regional affairs that he deems to be rightfully
                            his. At the same time, he has come to see a lessening in both the threat
                            of direct Soviet aggression and the likelihood of US support in case of
                            threats to Iran from other sources.</p>
                        <p>B. In consequence, the Shah now feels that Iran can and should be less
                            dependent on the US than in the past, though he will continue to regard
                            the US as the ultimate guarantor of Iran's security and his preferred
                            source of arms. His desire for a position of primacy in the Persian Gulf
                            will involve recurrent frictions with Saudi Arabia, a state of affairs
                            that will pose problems for the US and provide the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with opportunities for some expansion
                            of its influence in Teheran.</p>
                        <p>C. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has established itself as an
                            important factor in Iran's economic development. As relations between
                            the two countries continue to "normalize,” the Shah may become more
                            responsive than in the past to Soviet pressures on particular issues,
                            for example the maintenance <pb n="4" xml:id="d1-04" facs="d1-04"/>of US
                            special facilities on Iranian soil. This would be especially the case if
                            he came to believe that the US was providing insufficient support on
                            matters of particular interest to him.</p>
                        <p>D. In the domestic field, the Shah's reform program now seems to be
                            entering on a period of consolidation likely to last for some time.
                            Demands for greater political participation by educated groups are
                            likely to grow. If such participation is not permitted and if Iran's
                            economic progress should falter, this could pose serious problems for
                            his still narrowly-based regime, particularly if dissent were to find
                            support within the heretofore loyal military.</p>
                        <p>E. Iran's remarkable economic progress has been underwritten largely by
                            sharply rising oil revenues. We believe that differences between Western
                            companies and the Shah over production levels will be composed and that
                            continuing high levels of oil receipts will enable Iran's economic
                            growth to continue at a rapid rate and progress to be made on the many
                            intractable problems that hamper modernization of Iran's economy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION</p>
                        <p>1. The past five years have been marked by political stability and rapid
                            economic growth under the leadership of an increasingly self-assured
                            Shah. During this period he has shaken off his previous insecurity and
                            hesitance, emerging as a confident and purposeful leader. His successes
                            in discomfiting his political enemies and in cutting down possible
                            challengers have left him unrivaled at the center of power. These
                            achievements, often scored in disregard of the advice of his long-term
                            foreign allies, have reinforced his conviction that the country's
                            welfare and progress depend on his continuing rule. The elaborate
                            coronation ceremonies staged in October 1967 symbolized his
                            determination to assert his and Iran's prerogatives against all
                            comers.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah has ambitious plans for his country. He sees rapid economic
                            development as a way to acquire the power and prestige he wants for his
                            country internationally. For this he recognizes that some social change
                            and the spread of education are essential. His program of economic and
                            social change, expressed in the so-called "White Revolution,”(1) has
                            propelled some of Iran's semifeudal <pb n="5" xml:id="d1-05" facs="d1-05"/>landowners into the modern world, and has undermined
                            the powers and influence of the more reactionary. While these reforms
                            successfully stole the thunder of the radical opposition, they have
                            greatly increased the role of the government in Iranian life. It has
                            become responsible for such endeavors as providing the peasants credit
                            and assistance formerly supplied by the landlords.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (1) The "White Revolution" is the name given in 1962 to the
                            Shah's six-point program of land reform, profit sharing for workers,
                            eradication of illiteracy, electoral reform, nationalization of forests,
                            and the sale of government enterprises. It was subsequently broadened to
                            include the Health Corps, the Development Corps, the village court
                            system, nationalization of water resources, regional development, and a
                            program to increase administrative efficiency in government.</p>
                        <p>3. The structure of formal changes embodied in the reform program has now
                            been erected; the far more difficult task of carrying out the new
                            governmental functions effectively is not being pursued with the earlier
                            vigor. Nor does the Shah appear to have any dramatic new programs in
                            mind. In short, the White Revolution now seems to be entering on a
                            period of consolidation likely to last for some time. The effort to
                            spread education through the literacy corps of teachers assigned to
                            village schools has enjoyed considerable success, though mere literacy
                            at a bare functional level seems unlikely of itself to produce
                            far-reaching change. Locally elected courts have worked well. Land
                            reform has transformed patterns of peasant ownership. But the overall
                            position of the peasant in the countryside has not yet changed very
                            much, and efforts to alter attitudes, to raise living standards, and to
                            increase production present a continuing challenge that seems destined
                            to absorb the government's energies and attention for many years to
                            come.</p>
                        <p>4. The Shah has succeeded in presenting himself as a nationalist
                            reformer, but he has concentrated all political power in his own hands
                            and the regime remains narrowly based. In the last analysis it depends
                            on the army and security forces, which as far as we can tell are
                            faithful to the Shah. His efforts to enlist the support of well-educated
                            technocrats in important posts in government have borne fruit and many
                            members of the once politically restive middle class have had their
                            attention diverted to moneymaking. They were attracted by the scope for
                            action they have been allowed in the economic field. Yet their support
                            is not based on any widespread devotion to Iran's political system; an
                            economic recession could quickly reduce their sense of commitment to the
                            regime. This could also take place if the Shah's sense of infallibility
                            should lead him to restrict further their participation in the
                            decisionmaking process. Over the long term, economic development
                            probably will not provide a satisfactory substitute for greater
                            political participation. Hence, in a few years unrest may again begin to
                            reach significant levels among politically aware elements. In time this
                            could pose serious problems for the regime, particularly if dissent were
                            to find support within the military.</p>
                        <p>5. The Shah has attempted to institutionalize the regime by providing a
                            mechanism for succession. Despite traditional Iranian opposition to
                            women in political life, he has sought to build up the stature of the
                            Queen, who has been designated as regent for their seven-year old son if
                            the Shah should disappear from the scene for any reason. Although the
                            Shah has made some progress in breaking down these prejudices, such a
                            succession arrangement would be basically unstable. Initially at least
                            both the civilian political structure and the military would probably
                            support the monarchy, since both of these groups are essentially
                            interested in political stability. However, the former derives its power
                            from its support by the Shah; after his departure the military would
                            exert proportionately <pb n="6" xml:id="d1-06" facs="d1-06"/>more
                            influence. The military would almost certainly be more alert to any
                            possible diminution of their interests and, since they appear to be more
                            conservative than the Shah, might find it more difficult to accept the
                            primacy of the Queen as Regent. But at least in the beginning, a regime
                            which was dominated by these officers would probably continue to follow
                            much the present course.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. THE IRANIAN ECONOMY</p>
                        <p>6. During the past three years, economic growth has been proceding at an
                            annual rate of over 10 percent without incurring inflation, without a
                            major increase in debt, and without serious balance of payments
                            problems. This remarkable performance has been possible mainly because
                            rapidly increasing oil revenues permitted greatly expanded public
                            development expenditures and imports, with only minor strain on Iran's
                            foreign exchange position. The growing oil income coupled with liberal
                            credit policies has restored business confidence, encouraging a rapid
                            rise in private sector investment as well. Per capita income has risen
                            to a point where Iran is in the middle range of less developed
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>7. Development activity in Iran started in earnest with the resumption of
                            oil revenues in 1954. Since then the Iranian Government has been
                            attempting to direct the expansion of the economy through a series of
                            development plans. These plans at first concentrated on developing a
                            communications network, then after 1962 gave greater emphasis to
                            investment in industry and agriculture. The Third Plan (1962-1968)
                            surpassed its target of six percent average annual growth largely
                            because private sector investment recovered from the doldrums of the
                            early 1960's and was 75 percent higher than forecast. But throughout,
                            the mainstay of the development program has been the rapidly rising oil
                            revenues, most of which have been pledged to public sector
                            investment.(2) Especially in the early years of the Plan period
                            considerable private investment went into housing; domestic investors
                            have only recently begun putting much money into manufacturing and
                            agriculture. Despite the Plan's overall success, many intractable
                            problems remain that will hamper attempts to expand and modernize the
                            Iranian economy.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (2) The current Fourth Plan calls for 80 percent of revenues
                            to be devoted to this purpose.</p>
                        <p>8. Agriculture, which is still the most important source of income in
                            Iran, has lagged behind other sectors. While the sweeping land reform
                            program did not bring about the decreased productivity that normally
                            follows such disruptions, agricultural production recently has increased
                            at a rate not far above that of population growth. This modest rise has
                            been attributable more to favorable weather conditions than to
                            improvements in techniques. Even with the completion of the distribution
                            phase of the land reform program, the average Iranian peasant remains a
                            subsistence farmer, working small plots by primitive methods at low
                            yields. Many of the farming units created by land reform are too small
                            to make mechanized cultivation economic. The bureaucracy, short of
                            skilled manpower and more accustomed to ignore than to encourage the
                            peasant, is adapting only slowly to its role in stimulating development.
                            In view of the <pb n="7" xml:id="d1-07" facs="d1-07"/>enormity of the
                            problem, it will be some time before the government is able to fill the
                            needs of the new system, particularly requirements for credit and
                            marketing facilities as well as those of water, fertilizer, and
                            seeds.</p>
                        <p>9. The industrial sector has fared considerably better. Industry,
                            including manufacturing and mining, has grown rapidly and now almost
                            equals petroleum in importance as a contributor to gross national
                            product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>). Although most
                            manufacturing enterprises thus far have been in the textile or other
                            consumer-oriented fields, the government is undertaking to establish
                            heavy industry. A steel mill is under construction and the development
                            of petrochemical and aluminium industries has begun. This activity is
                            laying the base for continuing industrial growth. Yet it is already
                            beginning to tax Iran's limited resources in managerial talent and
                            skilled labor, which form the principal constraint to the expansion of
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>10. Oil has been the key to the success of the Iranian economy, and the
                            Shah is determined to increase his revenues from this source as much as
                            he can. He has pressed the Consortium of Western oil companies (3) very
                            hard for a commitment to guarantee Iran total payments of $5.9 billion
                            over the next five years-a sum which would mean an average annual
                            increase in oil revenue of about 16 percent. The companies would prefer
                            to expand production of cheaper oil in other Middle Eastern countries,
                            hence they have resisted his demands. Currently the Consortium seems
                            prepared to make total payments of about $5.0 billion over the five-year
                            period, an amount which would-under the current tax and royalty
                            structure-require a nearly 8 percent annual increase in oil production.
                            After a hard bargaining session in the spring of 1968, the Shah accepted
                            a compromise proposal by the companies whereby oil revenues accruing to
                            the Iranian Government during 1968/1969 would meet plan goals ($865
                            million), but figures for next year's offtake have not yet been agreed.
                            He has since shifted his ground somewhat and is now pressing for rapid
                            expansion of facilities necessary to permit sharp annual increases later
                            in the current five-year period.</p>
                        <p>[footnote](3) Forty percent of the Consortium shares are held by US
                            companies, 40 percent by British Petroleum, 14 percent by Royal
                            Dutch/Shell, and 6 percent by a French firm.</p>
                        <p>11. Both the Shah and the companies find oil production in Iran
                            profitable and neither wishes to precipitate a break. In this situation,
                            the two sides will no doubt explore numerous alternatives in involved
                            negotiations throughout the course of the next five years. The Shah
                            appears to be counting on the domestically owned National Iranian Oil
                            Company to expand its markets, primarily in Eastern Europe, sufficiently
                            to be able to dispose of the additional oil necessary to meet Iran's
                            targeted oil income. This will be a difficult task, particularly if the
                            Suez Canal remains closed, though more rapid progress will probably be
                            recorded after a large Israeli pipeline is completed in 1969. The Shah
                            also hopes for some improvement in the profit split on the operation of
                            the Abadan refinery. No such arrangements are likely to meet Iran's
                            demands in full, but we believe that in the end the Shah will accept a
                            compromise for the five-year period.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d1-08" facs="d1-08"/>
                        <p>12. In part we reach this conclusion because we believe that Iran will
                            not be able to spend money at quite the rate set in the Fourth
                            Development Plan (1968-1973). This Plan, which calls for investment of
                            $6.4 billion from the government and $4.4 billion from the private
                            sector, envisages annual economic growth of 9.4 percent. Already,
                            however, some major projects carried over from the Third Plan are
                            running behind schedule. Administrative and construction delays
                            reflecting unforeseen technical problems probably will hamper investment
                            somewhat in the future as well. Nonetheless, these shortfalls in meeting
                            Plan targets are likely to be modest, and Iran probably will be able to
                            sustain an average annual increase in <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> of about eight percent over the remainder of the Plan
                            period.</p>
                        <p>13. Presently projected increases in military expenditures probably will
                            not materially slow Iran's economic development. The Shah plans to
                            increase defense outlays at an annual rate of nearly 12 percent; as in
                            the past this target may significantly understate actual expenses. Iran
                            has already obtained from the US arrangements for credit sales of a
                            substantial quantity of military equipment. Repayment will not begin
                            until the goods are delivered and will stretch out over a number of
                            years, however, thus mitigating the immediate economic impact of these
                            purchases. Moreover, only about 10 percent of Iran's foreign exchange
                            earnings are currently committed to foreign economic and military debt
                            repayment. Hence, although Iranian free foreign exchange reserves have
                            recently declined somewhat, the country can afford to borrow from
                            abroad. Indeed, we believe that for some years to come Iran can continue
                            without significant strain to finance both its military and economic
                            programs at currently planned levels.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p>
                        <p>14. The Shah's present foreign policy has three major elements. One is
                            his longstanding reliance on the US as the ultimate support for Iran's
                            security. The second, more recently developed, is his belief that Iran
                            can and should seek the advantages of good relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that the political and economic
                            benefits thereof outweigh the risks to Iran. Third is an active concern
                            for asserting Iran's influence in the region, both to enhance access to
                            oil resources and to block the expansion of revolutionary Arab
                            nationalism. Since the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s announcement
                            of its intention to withdraw its forces by 1971, the Shah has focused
                            particular attention on the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Persian Gulf</p>
                        <p>15. The Shah is determined to discourage any outside power from playing
                            an influential role in the Gulf after the British leave. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> withdrawal from Yemen and the
                            resounding Egyptian defeat in the six-day war with Israel have to some
                            extent eased the Shah's fears of NASSER's ability to foment troubles in
                            the Gulf. Nonetheless, he still regards radical Arab nationalism as a
                            threat to <pb n="9" xml:id="d1-09" facs="d1-09"/>his position and an
                            especial danger to his province of Khuzistan, where the main Iranian oil
                            fields are located and which has a large Arab population. He therefore
                            feels impelled to expand his influence, particularly over the weak
                            feudal states on the Gulf, an aspiration encouraged by his confidence
                            that no country in the region can match Iran's power.</p>
                        <p>16. Iran's territorial claims in the Gulf are a major irritant in its
                            relations with the Arab states of the area. The Shah finds it hard to
                            abandon recently revived pretensions to Bahrein, though these
                            undoubtedly run counter to the desires of the overwhelming majority of
                            its population. While he evidently has no intention of asserting these
                            claims by force-and indeed would perhaps be willing to drop them if a
                            face-saving arrangement could be worked out-he opposes the nascent
                            Federation of Arab Amirates (<gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>). This
                            tenuous venture at combining the seven trucial sheikhdoms with Bahrein
                            and Qatar seems unlikely to achieve any significant unity; it may even
                            fall of its own weight before the British depart. Despite the Shah's
                            efforts to woo the sheikhs individually, his continuing opposition to
                            the inclusion of Bahrein in this grouping may further encourage the
                            federation's tendency to look to Saudi Arabia as its main source of
                            support. If the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> should collapse, the
                            Shah probably hopes to establish close ties with some of the
                            sheikhdoms-a relationship that they might welcome as an alternative to
                            the prospect of domination by Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>17. Iran also has claims to islands in the lower Gulf. The Shah fears the
                            possibility that hostile forces might gain control of the Strait of
                            Hormuz and close access to the Persian Gulf. However remote this
                            contingency may be, it nonetheless reinforces his desire to control Abu
                            Musa and the Tunb islands which are held by two of the small Gulf
                            sheikhdoms. In conversations with the British the Shah has asserted his
                            right to jurisdiction over these islands, but he may be willing to
                            settle for arrangements which would allow him to use them for defense
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>18. An even more important consideration in determining the Shah's
                            success in influencing developments in the Persian Gulf will be his
                            ability to maintain cordial relations with Saudi Arabia. Both countries
                            share concern lest radical Arab nationalism gain a foothold in this
                            area. Furthermore, each is interested in deriving maximum benefits from
                            undersea oil deposits. An agreement to resolve the most pressing
                            dispute-the location of the Saudi-Iranian portion of the median line in
                            the Persian Gulf-was reached in November 1968, although ratifications
                            have not yet been exchanged. But other stumbling blocks to cooperation
                            remain. Neither monarch wishes to admit the primacy of the other in the
                            Gulf; more importantly, the two have not been able to devise any common
                            approach to the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>. These factors will
                            probably increase frictions in the relationship of the two countries
                            already strained by centuries-old rivalries between Sunni Arabs and Shia
                            Iranians. Particularly unless both feel threatened by some external
                            force in the Gulf, enduring cooperation between the two rulers appears
                            unlikely.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Other Regional Relations</p>
                        <p>19. Iran views its other regional concerns as less immediate. The Shah is
                            not as afraid of Iraq as in times past. Yet he would be reluctant to
                            abandon his intrigues with the Kurds in northern Iraq whose dissidence
                            he sees as insurance in the event a more dangerous and purposeful regime
                            should come to power in Baghdad. Iran's interest in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> has declined considerably in recent
                            years, though the Shah has no desire to see it disappear entirely. Iran
                            never set much store by the Regional Cooperation for Development
                            arrangement; (4) its prospects have been further dimmed by coolness in
                            Iran's relations with Pakistan. In response to Pakistani support for
                            NASSER, the Shah is encouraging more intimate ties with India which he
                            visited early in 1969.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (4) The members of the Regional Cooperation for Development
                            are Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Relations with the US </p>
                        <p>20. As a sign of his increased independence the Shah in recent years has
                            sought publicly to appear less aligned with the West. Nonetheless, he
                            considers a relationship with the US as the cornerstone of his policy
                            and he looks to the US as the principal source of the weapons which he
                            feels he needs. He believes that he must have the capability not merely
                            to defend Persian shores and airspace, but to keep open the Strait of
                            Hormuz and perhaps to intervene on the Arab littoral as well. These
                            desires have led him to seek F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers, patrol craft,
                            C-130 air transports, Sheridan tanks, and other equipment from the US.
                            While he is basically content with the May 1968 military credit sales
                            program that could provide up to $600 million in such equipment over a
                            six-year period, he will continue to press for accelerated delivery of
                            the major items. If significant revolutionary activity were to erupt in
                            the Gulf, we would expect the Shah to request major additional arms from
                            the US; if he could not get some satisfaction from these efforts, he
                            would almost certainly seek weapons from other Western sources and from
                            the Soviet Union. At the same time, he may calculate that if he were to
                            pursue an overly aggressive policy in the Gulf, American arms might be
                            denied him.</p>
                        <p>21. Beyond the give and take of these arms negotiations, US-Iranian
                            relations are likely to be subjected to relatively little strain for the
                            next few years. Some longstanding irritants-such as litigation by a
                            former Iranian national attaching the assets of the Shah's brother and
                            sister-have disappeared in recent years. Despite the mounting
                            nationalist fervor that animates the Shah's actions, he continues to
                            value his association with the US. Hence the Shah has accepted with
                            equanimity the end of the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program in
                            1967; he is prepared to view his rapidly rising oil income as an
                            acceptable substitute. He also encourages private American investment in
                            Iran. The presence of our special facilities in Iran has not been a
                            point of contention.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d1-11" facs="d1-11"/>
                        <p>22. How long these facilities remain available and whether any expansion
                            would be possible will depend on a complex interplay of Iranian,
                            American, and Russian attitudes and actions. The Shah is aware of the
                            relationship between these facilities and Iran's own security. On the
                            other hand, one aspect of the Shah's increasing self-confidence and
                            independence is his willingness to adopt a more "normal" attitude toward
                            the Soviet Union. At some stage the Soviets may elect to urge that the
                            maintenance of US special facilities on Iranian soil is incompatible
                            with correct relations between Iran and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Such a line of argument might seem persuasive to the
                            Shah, especially if pressed at a time when he felt that the US was not
                            sufficiently forthcoming on matters of particular interest to him, such
                            as supply of military equipment or support of Iran's desire for a
                            position of primacy in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>23. The Shah is interested in fostering Moscow's "good neighbor" policy.
                            It offers him useful economic relationships, in the fields both of trade
                            and of development. It provides an additional source of military
                            equipment. It has attractive political aspects as well; the Shah may
                            calculate that a more cordial relationship between Teheran and Moscow
                            will serve to temper the ambitions of Moscow's Arab clients-those
                            radical states which the Shah sees as the most immediate threat to ] his
                            own aspirations in the Gulf. At the same time the Shah undoubtedly finds
                            it useful within Iran. It serves to undercut the criticisms of the left,
                            while the economic deals can be held up as hard bargains much beloved by
                            Iranians of any class. Considerations such as these probably underlay
                            the Iranian decision to purchase over $110 million of arms-not including
                            advanced weaponry-from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, though
                            the immediate occasion was the withholding of US credits. At the same
                            time, the Shah recognizes that to procure surface-to-surface missiles
                            and other advanced weapon systems from the Soviet Union would call into
                            question continuation of military deliveries from the US. Hence, we
                            believe that the Shah will not turn to the Soviets for major items of
                            sophisticated equipment as long as he is reasonably satisfied by Western
                            supply.</p>
                        <p>24. In the economic field, Iran continues to expand its relations with
                            the Soviet Union. The principal deal thus far involves an exchange of
                            natural gas for a steel mill and other items. While Iran will have to
                            make substantial investments of its own in connection with these
                            projects, the Shah is particularly pleased by this arrangement, which
                            brings him a substantial return for gas that had previously been flared
                            in the process of oil production. The pipeline essential for delivery of
                            this gas is somewhat behind schedule, however, mainly because of
                            construction delays, occasioning some friction between the two
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>25. In June 1968 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> extended a
                            credit of about $200 million for development projects under the Fourth
                            Plan also to be repaid by natural gas deliveries. Present economic deals
                            will use about $545 million of Iran's expected $900 million in Soviet
                            barter credits for the period 1970-1985. The uncommitted credit balance
                            could rise further if the gas pipeline capacity should be enlarged, <pb n="12" xml:id="d1-12" facs="d1-12"/>a project perennially under
                            consideration. In any event, though dwarfed by comparison with the
                            activities of the Western oil companies, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has established itself as a major factor in Iranian
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>26. The Iranian Government is careful to restrict the flow of Soviet
                            technical aid personnel into Iran, and the omnipresent security force
                            keeps them under surveillance. The Shah has been particularly sensitive
                            about permitting Soviet contact with Iranian military personnel. Only a
                            few have been sent to the Soviet Union for specialized training-and
                            these for short periods. Some Soviet technicians were permitted to
                            accompany military equipment sent from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but they remained only a few months; there do not
                            appear to be any Soviet military advisers in Iran at present. Moreover,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s interest in the Indian Ocean
                            and the Persian Gulf may give rise to new strains in Soviet-Iranian
                            relations. Although the Shah felt constrained to permit a visit by three
                            Soviet naval vessels to the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas in June,
                            he clearly does not want to see the Soviets become more active in this
                            area-a possibility that will become more immediate when and if the Suez
                            Canal is opened. Indeed, there are limits beyond which the Shah is not
                            likely to go in deemphasizing his ties to the West and in improving
                            relations with the Communist countries. At bottom, the Shah remains wary
                            of the Soviet Union and suspicious of the revolutionary potential of its
                            Arab clients.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> is calling on you
                            prior to his departing on February 4 to consult with the Shah who is now
                            vacationing in Switzerland. Enclosed are a biography of the Ambassador
                            and a summary statement of our relations with Iran.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName>'s primary purpose
                            in calling on you is undoubtedly to get an indication of the new
                            Administration's attitude toward Iran which he can report to the Shah.
                            Before he departs for Switzerland, he is also calling on Secretary
                            Rogers and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and on Secretary of Interior Hickel.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the Ambassador raises with you specific bilateral
                            matters, we suggest that you respond by saying that you will look into
                            them. He may raise the matter of our military credit program for Iran;
                            following receipt of necessary economic data from the Government of
                            Iran, we expect to be in a position to make policy recommendations in
                            March. He may also raise Iran's desire to export additional oil to the
                            United States, a subject he will undoubtedly raise with Secretary Hickel
                            and which involves our import quota policy.</p>
                        <p>We suggest that you tell the Ambassador that you know of the President's
                            admiration for the progress Iran has made under the Shah's leadership
                            and of the President's desire to strengthen our close ties with Iran.
                            You might refer with pleasure to <pb n="2" xml:id="d2-02" facs="d2-02"/>your brief meeting with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> in December. If the Ambassador raises the Shah's
                            desire, expressed in his letter of January 22 to the President, to meet
                            soon with the President, you might say we are giving the matter serious
                            attention and that the President hopes to reply soon.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. U.S. Interests in Iran </p>
                        <p>The principal United States interest in Iran derives from Iran's
                            strategic location on the Soviet border and athwart the air and
                            communications routes from Europe to South Asia and the Far East. We
                            have an interest in keeping this strategic territory out of Soviet hands
                            and in using it for our own strategic purposes. We also have an interest
                            in maintaining close ties with an increasingly powerful Iran so as to
                            influence Iranian policies in the direction of promoting stability in
                            the Middle East. We also have specific commercial interests, primarily
                            in petroleumm, but also increasingly in other fields as well as Iran's
                            economy grows.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Current State of U.S.-Iranian Relations</p>
                        <p>Our relations with Iran have been for many years and remain today close
                            and intimate. We have maintained this relationship through a
                            transitional period in recent years during which we have ended grant
                            economic assistance to Iran and shifted our military aid from grant to
                            credit sales and during which Iran had adopted a more independent
                            foreign policy of its own, demonstrated especially by improved relations
                            and economic and military deals with the Soviet Union. Iran's basic
                            orientation remains with the West, and Iran continues to rely on <pb n="4" xml:id="d2-04" facs="d2-04"/>the United States for its
                            fundamental security. (Our bilateral agreement with Iran of 1959 states
                            that we will take appropriate action, including the use of armed forces,
                            in accordance with our Constitution, and as may be mutually agreed upon,
                            to assist Iran against aggression.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Iran's Foreign and Domestic Situation</p>
                        <p>Iran has in recent years played an increasingly active role in regional
                            affairs. The Shah has become concerned about possible radical Arab
                            penetration, perhaps with Soviet collusion into the Persian Gulf
                            following the withdrawal of British forces in 1971. He has therefore
                            moved to protect Iran's Gulf life-line and rich southern oil resources
                            through a carrot-and-stick policy toward Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
                            Sheikhdoms. Iran's relations with Turkey and Pakistan are good, and
                            relations with Afghanistan have been improving. While, as a Moslem
                            country, Iran's public stance on Arab-Israeli matters is generally
                            pro-Arab, Iran's distaste for radical Arabism as sponsored by NASSER has
                            led to the development of close, although informal, relations with,
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p>Iran's internal political situation is stable, with the Shah in firm
                            control and with any potential opposition quieted by the success of the
                            regime's economic development and social <pb n="5" xml:id="d2-05" facs="d2-05"/>reform programs and by the appeal of the Shah's
                            nationalistic foreign policy. Economic growth, based primarily on
                            burgeoning oil revenues but also on better use of Iran's well-trained
                            younger generation, has been proceeding rapidly, with annual rates of
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> growth approximating 9 per cent
                            in recent years.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. U.S. Objectives</p>
                        <p>The objectives of our Iranian policy are:</p>
                        <p>- To support an independent, self-reliant Iran.</p>
                        <p>- To maintain our close ties with Iran, especially with the Shah.</p>
                        <p>- To assure Iranian vigilance against Soviet long-term aims.</p>
                        <p>- To maintain our communications and intelligence facilities and
                            overflight privileges in Iran.</p>
                        <p>- To influence Iran to promote stability in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>- To maintain western access to Iranian oil, protect and promote American
                            investment in Iran, and obtain for the U.S. the largest possible share
                            of the growing Iranian market.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. U.S. Strategy</p>
                        <p>To achieve our objectives, we have devised a political, military and
                            economic strategy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Political</p>
                        <p>In our dealings with Iran we respect Iran's independence and welcome its
                            self-reliance while seeking-to maintain our <pb n="6" xml:id="d2-06" facs="d2-06"/>special security relationship. We use all possible
                            opportunities, for example in connection with our military credit
                            program, to urge upon the Shah and Iranian government leaders the
                            importance of concentrating financial and manpower resources on economic
                            development. We encourage good relations with Saudi Arabia and the full
                            Sheikhdoms in the interest of maintaining stability and of keeping out
                            forces bent on making trouble. While expressing understanding of the
                            economic benefits Iran reaps from its improved relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, we remind the Iranians of low-term
                            Soviet objectives and encourage vigilance. Of special importance since
                            the ending of our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program in order
                            to promote close ties between us are programs involving exchanges of
                            persons between our two countries, whether under public (Peace Corps,
                            Fulbright program) or private auspices, and programs of cooperation in
                            scientific and other areas where Iran is in need of advanced
                            technological or management assistance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Military</p>
                        <p>The key to our relations with the Shah and his regime is our assistance
                            for the modernization of Iran's armed' forces. Beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970, except for training and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> support, all of this assistance will
                            be in the form of credits. The Shah's demands for military equipment
                            from us are insistent <pb n="7" xml:id="d2-07" facs="d2-07"/>and large,
                            and have increased since theg annoncement of the British withdrawal from
                            the Gulf. We have to examine these requests carefully, from the
                            standpoint of their effect on area stability and on Iran's economic
                            development, but it is also clear that unless we remain Iran's principal
                            military supplier our interests in Iran, including our ability to
                            maintain our own strategic interests there and to influence the Shah in
                            the direction of constructive foreign and domestic policies, will be
                            seriously weakened.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Economic</p>
                        <p>Although our grant economic aid has ended, we continue to do all we can
                            to encourage Iran's economic growth and a balanced allocation of
                            resources between military and economic. Our military credit program
                            gives us our best opportunity to pursue these goals, but others also
                            exist, including private American resources. Of vital importance to
                            Iran's development is the maintenance of constructive relations between
                            Iran and the major oil companies operating there. Our diplomatic efforts
                            are aimed at preserving the good relations that now exist: Finally, our
                            own commercial interests are promoted through the Export-Import Bank,
                            private American-investment, trade fairs and the like which assist the
                            export of American products to Iran.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: AT SHAH'S INSTRUCTIONS, <gloss target="#t_PMPRIMIN1">PRIMIN</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> HAS "NOTIFIED"
                            AMBASSADORS OF FOUR COUNTRIES REPRESENTED IN CONSORTIUM THAT UNLESS $1
                            BILLION IS FORTHCOMING OIL REVENUES DURING COMING IRANIAN YEAR, IRAN
                            WILL UNDERTAKE UNILATERAL LEGISLATION EITHER DEPRIVING CONSORTIUM OF 50
                            PERCENT OF ITS INTERESTS OR MAKING "COST OIL" AVAILABLE FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MARKETING. OBVIOUSLY SHAH HOPES <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND OTHERS WILL EXERT PRESSURE ON
                            COMPANIES TO INCREASE LIFTINGS.</p>
                        <p>1. NOTING THAT CONSORTIUM HAD INDICATED TO SHAW AT ZURICH THAT EXPECTED
                            $1 BILLION IN REVENUE TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DURING NEXT

                            SAID HE NOTIFYING AMBASSADORS OF FOUR COUNTRIES REPRESENTED IN
                            CONSORTIUM THAT UNLESS CONSORTIUM PRODUCES AS <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> EXPECTED UNILATERAL LEGISLATION WILL BE ENACTED, EITHER

                            WILL THEN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES: OR B) REQUIRING MEMBER
                            COMPANIES TO PROVIDE OIL AT COST FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            TO MARKET AS IT SEES FIT. HOVEYDA ADDED THAT LEGISLATION IS ALREADY
                            BEING DRAFTED.</p>
                        <p>2. WITH <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> APPARENTLY
                            AWAITING MY REACTION, I POINTED OUT THAT UNLIKE BRITISH <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss>
                            NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED. AS FRIEND OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            AND CONSORTIUM, HOWEVER, WE SINCERELY HOPED PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAD PROVED
                            SO FRUITFUL WOULD CONTINUE. CONSORTIUM'S RECORD, I SAID, IS ALMOST
                            PHENOMENAL. FROM 1954 WHEN IRAN WAS FLAT ON <pb n="2" xml:id="d3-02" facs="d3-02"/>ITS BACK CONSORTIUM PRODUCTION HAS REACHED POINT WHERE
                            IRAN IS IN NECK AND NECK RACE WITH SAUDI ARABIA FOR MIDEAST LEADERSHIP.
                            IN PAST TWO YEARS ALONE, PRODUCTION HAS SHOT UP 32 PER CENT.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> SAID GOI HAS CAREFULLY
                            CALCULATED ALL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES OF MEMBER
                            COMPANIES AS WELL AS IRAN'S NEEDS. ECHOING POINT SHAW CONTINUALLY
                            EMPHASIZES, <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> INSISTED
                            CONSORTIUM MEMBERS SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IRAN'S CONSTRUCTIVE POLICIES
                            AND SUPPORT PROGRESS OF IRAN RATHER THAN PAYING VAST SUMS TO TINY
                            SHEIKHDOMS, E.G. KUWAIT AND ABU DHABI, WHOSE NEEDS ARE ONLY FRACTION OF
                            THOSE OF IRAN. HE EXHIBITED ADVERTISEMENT FROM SOME BRITISH NEWSPAPER
                            DESCRIBING ENORMOUS PROFITS TO BE MADE IN, OIL-RICH DUBAI.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> WENT ON TO SAY THAT
                            IRAN'S MOMENTUM SIMPLY HAD TO BE MAINTAINED. ONE BILLION DOLLAR INCOME
                            FROM CONSORTIUM (ASIDE FROM EXTRA INCOME FROM OTHER OIL ACTIVITIES)
                            INCLUDED IN BUDGET HE HAS PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT. MILITARY BUDGET
                            CANNOT BE CUT. HENCE $100 MILLIION SHORTFALL WOULD AFFECT DEVELOPMENT
                            BUDGET. IF LATER IS REDUCED, ANTICIPATED 12 PERCENT GROWTH RATE WOULD
                            SUFFER SHARPLY AND THIS INTOLERABLE.</p>
                        <p>5. PARENTHETICALLY, I NOTED MORNING PAPERS INDICATED MILITARY BUDGET UP
                            20 PERCENT WHICH CONTRARY TO 12 PER CENT FIGURE WHICH <gloss target="#t_PMPRIMIN1">PRIMIN</gloss> HAD FORECAST DURING OUR ANNUAL
                            REVIEW LAST SPRING. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName>
                            CONTENDED THAT MILITARY INCREASE IS ACTUALLY ONLY 13 PERCENT OF TOTAL
                            BUDGET, I.E. CURRENT AND DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                        <p>6. NOTING REGRET THAT OIL ISSUE HAS SO QUICKLY REACHED POINT OF SUCH
                            DRASTIC ULTIMATUMS I GAVE AS MY IMPRESSION THERE BEEN BREAK DOWN IN
                            COMMUNICATIONS. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> INSISTED
                            HE HIMSELF HAD TOLD CONSORTIUM REPS IN PARIS AND AGAIN IN NEW YORK THAT
                            SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF $1 BILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED. WHEN I ASKED WHETHER
                            THEY HAD INDICATED COMPLIANCE, <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> ACKNOWLEDGED THEY HAD ONLY INDICTED MATTER WOULD
                            BE STUDIED. I SUGGESTED MORE FORTHRIGHT EXCHANGES OF VIEWS BETWEEN TWO
                            PARTIES.</p>
                        <p>7. EXPRESSING SINCERE HOPE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-CONSORTIUM
                            PARTNERSHIP WOULD NOT BREAK DOWN, I POINTED TO SORRY PLIGHT OF IRAQ,
                            WHICH HAD GONE DOWN ROAD OF UNILATERAL LEGISLATION. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> SAID CONDITIONS ARE DIFFERENT
                            FROM MOSADEQ DAYS. 0IL WOULD NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT
                            STAY IN <pb n="3" xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>GROUND. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ITSELF CAN FIND MARKETS. BESIDES THERE
                            ARE PLENTY OF PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS, INCLUDING AMERICANS DEFINITELY
                            INTERESTED. HE ALSO NOTED FRENCH ANXIOUSLY SEEKING MORE OIL SUPPLIES. I
                            EXPRESSED DOUBT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> COULD READILY PICK
                            UP $1 BILLION FROM OTHER SOURCES FOR COMING YEAR'S BUDGET.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> SAID IF RUPTURE TAKES
                            PLACE WITH CONSORTIUM, OIL INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT MIDEAST WOULD BE
                            ADVERSELY AFFECTED. I VOICED COUNTER VIEW THAT ARAB PRODUCERS WOULD BE
                            DELIGHTED TO MARKET ADDITIONAL OIL IF IRAN GETS IN TROUBLE. I ALSO
                            REFERRED TO EDITH PENROSE'S THESIS ON LIKLIHOOD OF BREAK IN OIL PRICES
                            AS MORE ENTREPRENEURS GET INTO ACT.</p>
                        <p>9. REITERATING UG CONSIDERS ITSELF FRIEND OF BOTH PARTIES, I PRAISED
                            IRAN'S REMARKABLE PROGRESS WHICH IN NO SMALL MEASURE DUE TO OIL INCOME.
                            WE SHARE HIS DESIRE, I SAID, THAT MOMENTUM CONTINUE FOR IRAN IS
                            WHOLESOME EXAMPLE FOR MIDEAST. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> RECALLED WARM WORDS WHICH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">JOHNSON</persName> AND OTHER LEADERS HAD VOICED IN
                            THIS CONNECTION. AT STAKE, I SAID, IS NOT ONLY CREDITWORTHINESS OF IRAN
                            BUT OVER-ALL FAVORABLE INVESTMENT CLIMATE FOR WHICH, AS JOHN MCCLOY HAS
                            STATED DURING HIS TEHRAN VISITS, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S
                            RELATIONS WITH OIL COMPANIES IS "BELLWETHER.”</p>

                        <p>10. ASKED WHETHER PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN OF TYPE: EMPLOYED BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> YEAR AGO WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN, HOVEYDA
                            SAID THAT NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT ANTICIPATED FOR
                            THE PRESENT.</p>
                        <p>11. MEETING CLOSED WITH BOTH OF US EXPRESSING HOPE THAT PROBLEM CAN BE
                            RESOLVED WITHOUT MAJOR UPHEAVAL.</p>
                        <p>12. COMMENT: <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> SEEMED TO
                            HAVE LITTLE INFO OTHER THAN THAT SHAH HAD ORDERED HIM TO "NOTIFY" US
                            FOUR AMBASSADORS. FACT THAT HE HAD NOTE-TAKER PRESENT (FOR FIRST TIME)
                            WOULD INDICATE, HE WISHED HAVE RECORD TO SHOW SHAH BOTH OF HIS REMARKS
                            AND, OUR RESPONSES. HOVEYDA WAS AWARE SHAH GREATLY UPSET, BUT HIS
                            DEMARCHE WAS RESTRAINED, AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO PUT MOST REASONABLE FACE

                            <item>Your Meeting with Iranian Ambassador Ansary, Thursday, March 6,
                                1969 at 12:15 p.m.: BRIEFING MEMORANDUM</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Ambassador is calling at his request. He has indicated that he has
                            two things on his mind: oil and any late developments on the
                            Arab-Israeli situation as a result of the President's trip to Europe. I
                            have told him, on the second subject, that I was sure you would tell him
                            what you could.</p>
                        <p>Regarding oil, I had a good talk with him yesterday evening, the record
                            of which is attached. He appears to be as eager as we are to have this
                            year's problem settled. He feels that the Consortium's justification of
                            its inability to meet Iran's demands is weak, especially concerning its
                            failure to give Iran increases which at least match the average increase
                            for the area and concerning its member companies' activity in the
                            Sheikhdoms. He has instructions to make a formal demarche to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>I suggest you make the following points in response:</p>
                        <p>1. We have no control over the policies of the American companies, and it
                            would be inappropriate for us to make their policies. We have, however,
                            passed on to them the substance of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>'s statements to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>. The companies have
                            made it clear to us that they will not be able to meet Iran's demands
                            for $1 billion in revenues for the, next Iranian year, and they have
                            told us nothing, that would lead us to believe that they can improve in
                            any significant way, on their offer of $900 million. In short, Iran's

                        <p>I called on the Ambassador at his request to discuss the current dispute
                            between the Iranian Government and the Oil Consortium. The Ambassador
                            inquired about the position which the Consortium delegation will take in
                            its talks in Tehran next week.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I did not know what position the delegation
                            would take. From the talks we have had with the companies, however, it
                            seems clear that they will not be able to meet the Iranian request for
                            $1 billion in revenues for the next Iranian year (1348). In fact,
                            nothing that I had heard led me to believe that the Consortium could
                            improve on its current offer of $900 million in any significant way. I
                            said that different company officials say different things, with a range
                            in outlook from those who hope to keep the door open for further
                            discussions in order to avoid a blow-up to those who are tired of the
                            constant pressure from the Iranian side and believe the time has come
                            for a showdown.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he could not understand this talk about pressure
                            from the Iranian Government. If the Iranians had put on a lot of
                            pressure last year, why was it that Iran's offtake increase by the same
                            amount as Saudi Arabia's? If Iran had put pressure on the companies, it
                            certainly didn't appear to have produced any results. In addition, he
                            was not convinced by another company argument to the effect that threats
                            of unilateral action by Iran force the companies to diversify their
                            position and to expand their operations <pb n="3" xml:id="d4-03" facs="d4-03"/>in the Sheikhdoms. How can the companies, after so
                            many years of good relations with Iran, feel that their investment will
                            be safer in Arab countries who less than two years ago acted against the
                            companies? Finally, and most importantly, he could not understand the
                            Consortium's argument that Iran would be treated equitably when in fact
                            offtake from Iran was increasing at a slower rate than that of the area
                            as a whole. In short, the Government of Iran was willing to discuss this
                            matter with the companies, but the companies had to have more credible
                            justifications for their positions than they have so far put
                            forward.</p>
                        <p>I said that the companies make the point to us that over the years, and
                            especially during the past two years, they have increased their liftings
                            from Iran at at least the average rate of increase for the area as a
                            whole. In 1968, this did not happen, partly because of the economics
                            favoring full use of the reopened <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            pipeline. The Ambassador noted that the companies made good in one year
                            production in the Arab countries whose own actions had disrupted their
                            activities, whereas it had taken 17 years for Iran to recover from the
                            Mosadeq era.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that it is my hope that both sides would want to
                            keep the discussions going and that next week's meetings in Tehran would
                            not result in hasty or rash action by anyone. At the same time, it was
                            clear that such a discussion was going to be difficult because the
                            companies find Iran's demand for $1 billion out of the question. I asked
                            if the companies could expect any give in the Iranian position.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador noted that the Prime Minister had told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> that the Government of
                            Iran is willing to grant any request by the companies for an extension
                            of time and for further discussions. If the companies were to request
                            such an extension, it would not be taken to mean that they were planning
                            to improve their offer.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to the Ambassador that one of the problems is that, given the
                            figures for oil revenues in Iran's Fourth Plan, the situation will
                            become worse in each of the next three years. This aspect of the matter
                            disturbs the companies too.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador agreed that this was a problem. We both agreed that this
                            year's dispute and any similar disputes in future years could have
                            repercussions on other aspects of our bilateral relations. We <pb n="4" xml:id="d4-04" facs="d4-04"/>agreed further that the time had come
                            for all concerned to think seriously about how such disputes can be
                            avoided. The Ambassador expressed the hope that not only could the
                            dispute this year and the next three years be resolved but that the
                            overall relations between Iran and the Consortium could be put on a
                            firmer foundation for the next several years ahead so that neither
                            country would have to worry about this problem.</p>

                        <p>Dear Ted,</p>
                        <p>As old Persian hands, it was not surprising that you and I jumped to
                            similar conclusions (your letter of March 13) re the choosing of two
                            months for the consortium moratorium. Dropping the note of warning re
                            the impact on F-4's of a blow-up re oil undoubtedly had an effect.
                            Unfortunately, not exactly the one we might have had in mind, i.e. an
                            early resolution of the current crisis on mutually satisfactory
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>In support of our surmises, I note that Mehdi conjectured with Bob re the
                            program for nailing down the next tranche, e.g. my final review with
                                <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> prior to his mid-April visit to
                            Tunisia, and <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Mehdi</persName>'s plans to
                            come to Washington for credit negotiations the first week of May (before
                            May 10!)</p>
                        <p>When I returned from Khuzistan, there was waiting a call from ALAM. He
                            wished to have tea. Denis had also been summoned. In both cases, it
                            turned out that oil was only subject #2. For Denis, the primary cause
                            was Bahrein (separate letter re this). For me, it was Seventh Tranche,
                            and ALAM spoke from notes taken in a discussion with <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Shah, ALAM said, had certain indications there might be a delay re
                            the F-4's. I outlined where we are on the annual review, etc. I also
                            described my own feelings about haste making waste… . . in the F-4
                            program as in the petrochemical industry which I had just visited.
                            ALAM's notes included reference to the increased millions it would cost
                            if the fourth F-4 squadron were deferred a year. I agreed this was a
                            formidable factor, and then went on to explain the problem of crowding
                            two squadrons into one $100 million tranche and still having something
                            left over for other needs. In discussing this matter, I made clear that
                            the actual delineation of the tranche must in any case await the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decision whether the next $100 million
                            of credit would be available. In this connection, I did acknowledge our
                            hope that as of the present the indicators were still good.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d5-02" facs="d5-02"/>
                        <p>When discussing the military subject, I did not again this time make
                            direct linkage with the oil talks. However, later on when we were
                            discussing oil, I again emphasized to ALAM what a calamity it will be,
                            including specifically in the creditworthiness field, if the oil problem
                            is not resolved.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, re F-4's, I noted the general consensus that it would be
                            preferable if Iran did not have to shell out extra millions and,
                            therefore, the desirability of placing the orders this year. I did,
                            however, make clear my own rpt my own serious doubts whether the
                            delivery of the fourth squadron need take place before December 31,
                            1971. I referred to the technician problem, and what a calamity it would
                            be if in such hastiness one or more $3 million F-4's were piled up.
                            Alam, as usual, was fully sympathetic, but unfortunately I find him
                            increasingly out of tune with his impetuous boss.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the fact that the Shah commissioned ALAM to raise the
                            military subject is significant. I suspect the fact that I have not
                            asked for an audience may also have contributed to the Shah's
                            uneasiness. This may be healthy.</p>
                        <p>But it does pose for you and for me a problem. Do we or do we not place
                            orders for the third and fourth F-4 squadrons before May 10? The answer
                            may lie beyond your capability and mine, for I suspect there may be
                            quite a body of opinion around Washington which will wish to delay until
                            the May 10 crunch is over. On the other hand, if it is obvious that we
                            are dragging our feet, it can propel our friend at Niavarand into
                            undesirable directions. Frankly, I do not know the answer. But I would
                            like to think that we can carry on business as usual, dropping in such
                            notes of warning as we have in the past month, leaving any dramatic
                            suspension of the F-4 program until after a breakdown in the
                                consortium-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> relationship if that
                            unhappy event should in fact take place.</p>
                        <p>My own belief is that, although both sides are dug in more deeply this
                            time than in previous years, a way out is still possible. The Shah's
                            "compromise" proposal isn't much, but at least it shows that he wants to
                            find a way out. As you may have noted, I really bore down hard on ALAM
                            to the effect that virtually no compromise resolution this year is
                            possible if the consortium must expect even worse ordeals in each of the
                            next three years.</p>
                        <p>Which leads me to one line of thought with which I have been toying. Do
                            you suppose we could get both the consortium and the Shah to agree to
                            the Shah's compromise proposal (which the consortium reps amazingly did
                            not reject out of hand in their farewell talk with me) provided <pb n="3" xml:id="d5-03" facs="d5-03"/>that we can also get <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>'s agreement that in the next three
                            years of the plan he will rely on the consortium's good faith to lift
                            oil in sufficient quantities to keep Iran at a level no less than that
                            of the Middle East generally? It strikes me this would have some appeal
                            to the consortium chaps. It might even have some appeal to <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>, for, as ALAM has disclosed, HIM
                            himself is getting a bit uncomfortable about having these crunches every
                            year.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, my own belief is that stretching out the Fourth Plan
                            may indeed be a distinct possibility (your letter of March 7). <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Mehdi</persName> certainly has had thoughts along
                            that line. I may even drop the idea into the hopper at a suitable
                            (non-oil) occasion. But it is our strong conviction here that if the
                            consortium boys were so much as to hint at such a stretch-out, it would
                            be the kiss of death.</p>
                        <p>Anyhow, these are my current thoughts. Some of them may be showing up in
                            the traffic in the days ahead. In the meantime, if you have any
                            suggestions, let me know.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">PILOT TRAINING:</p>
                        <p> The Shah initiated the conversation by indicating he would like to train
                            all Iranian pilots in the United States. Some pilot training was now
                            being conducted in Pakistan. For a number of reasons, such as the
                            exposure of the pilot trainees to pro-Chinese propaganda, the Shah felt
                            it was highly desirable that the training being conducted in Pakistan be
                            terminated. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                            responded he was in sympathy with the Shah's sentiments but gave no
                            assurance or promises concerning accommodation of the Shah's
                            desires.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">THREATS FACING IRAN:</p>
                        <p> The Shah cited various threats with which Iran was concerned. The first
                            was the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In point of fact, the
                            Shah indicated, he did not fear outright aggression by the Soviet Union
                            since it was his belief such aggression would elicit a concerted Free
                            World response. That provided, in his judgment, a satisfactory
                            deterrent. The more probable and more logical threat was that of local
                            and limited war. The Shah said he sought adequate strength to ward off
                            any "foolish aggressor.”</p>
                        <p>Continuing that theme, the Shah indicated he did not know how the
                            Arab-Israeli conflict would be resolved. He expressed agreement with the
                            US approach to the situation, particularly the dimension of balance — or
                            more even-handedness — being sought among the Israeli and Arab factions.
                            The Arabs had provoked in an unwarranted fashion, the Shah felt, an
                            extremely serious situation. In the Shah's words they had "botched the
                            things.” On the other hand, Israel should not be allowed to hold
                            territory gained by force. It was not clear how and when a resolution of
                            this exceedingly <pb n="2" xml:id="d6-02" facs="d6-02"/>complex
                            situation could be attained. The Shah added, almost as an aside, that
                            Iran had been afraid for awhile the US was pro-NASSER. (While expressing
                            this apprehension, the Shah added "God forbid.”)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IRAN'S DESIRE FOR <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> TECHNICIANS:</p>
                        <p> Turning to Iran's force structure, the Shah indicated he would like to
                            speed up the F-4E program. To do that, he felt, he would need more
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> mechanics. In a pragmatic
                            vein, he confessed one of the principal reasons was that of cost. It was
                            obvious that Air Force mechanics would represent less of a burden to
                            Iran than McDonnell Douglas personnel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> added that while the Air Force
                            presently had 54 mechanics in Iran, more would be needed in 1971 when
                            the F-4E were introduced.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> was non-committal
                            concerning this request, noting only that the United States faced
                            serious problems in retaining highly-qualified Service personnel. The
                            result was a personnel bind and an ancillary cost problem for us.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">AIRCRAFT CONSORTIUM AND OTHER WEAPONS
                            PROGRAMS:</p>
                        <p> Continuing to discuss the hardware segment of the Iranian forces, the
                            Shah said he was anxious to be a member of a consortium on the Northrop
                            P-530. He felt this aircraft would be a logical complement to the four
                            squadrons of F-4Es Iran was planning. The P-530 would be a cheaper
                            aircraft than the F-4 and an easier aircraft to maintain. At the same
                            time, it would have an effectiveness, the Shah felt, greater than the
                            F-5. The latter aircraft, he maintained, would not be good enough for
                            the needs of the early to mid-1970s.</p>
                        <p>Pressing the point in encouraging US support for a P-530 consortium, the
                            Shah felt the Netherlands would be willing to be a member, that perhaps
                            the Italians would be interested, and perhaps even the Federal Republic
                            of Germany. He was not so sure about others, such as the Belgians or the
                            Japanese. While discussing the point of possible Japanese involvement in
                            an aircraft consortium, the Shah deplored the low interest the Japanese
                            had shown in carrying a fair part of the Free World defense burden. He
                            noted, for example, the Japanese defense budget was only about 1% of its
                            gross national product. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> shared the Shah's misgivings about other Free
                            World nations carrying so little of the security load and expressed the
                            conviction that such nations would have to increase their burden-sharing
                            in the future. If that did not occur, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> continued, there would be
                            increasing discontent in the United States. Already the military
                            establishment is under increasing Congressional and public fire, the
                            Secretary noted.</p>
                        <p>Returning again to the discussion of specific military hardware, the Shah
                            indicated he wanted the P-530 for an interceptor role. He explained that
                            Iran had forgone purchase of the Hawk missile because of its limited
                            area defense capability. Aircraft, he reasoned, have a greater
                            flexibility with a capability to cover wider areas. Almost
                            parenthetically, <pb n="3" xml:id="d6-03" facs="d6-03"/>the Shah added
                            that he was considering discussing with Saudi Arabia the prospects of
                            purchasing common weapons types. Such an eventuality, he felt, would be
                            a reasonable approach to regional arms arrangements.</p>
                        <p>As a final note, The Shah concluded that Iran would not have a large
                            standing army. Costs would simply be prohibitive. Nonetheless, he felt,
                            it was essential for Iran to manufacture its own unsophisticated
                            weapons. He listed in that category such generic items as ordnance,
                            spare parts, and even possibly engines. As something of an afterthought,
                            he expressed some interest in the Sheridan tank for Iran. He was
                            particularly interested in its speed, range, and the possibilities for
                            the Shillelagh missile.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> REGIONAL OUTLOOK:</p>
                        <p> Turning from hardware to a more philosophical vein, the Shah expressed
                            grave concern about the turn of events in Pakistan. He felt the new
                            regime might have some prospect for establishing order if it could
                            successfully fight the deeply ingrained corruption. He did not seem
                            optimistic, however. He was also apprehensive about events in Turkey. It
                            was clear, in the Shah's view, that Turkey must be able "to prevent
                            minorities from betraying their own country.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> asked the Shah
                            what effect the United Kingdom's move from those regions east of the
                            Suez would have. The Shah felt the outcome would have both plus and
                            minus aspects. On the positive side, it would create incentives for
                            others in the region to work together. On the negative side, there would
                            be considerable resultant chaos. Some countries in the region, the Shah
                            felt, were simply not ready for the added responsibility that would
                            befall them. If some of the countries in the Persian Gulf region, like
                            Iran and Saudi Arabia, were to get together, he suggested, they could
                            handle the regional problems. The Shah did not speculate on the
                            prospects for such an eventuality. Again, parenthetically, the Shah
                            deplored the trouble the United Kingdom historically leaves in its wake
                            everywhere it goes.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the Arab-Israeli theme, the Shah expressed hope that the
                            United States' efforts at peace might be successful. If that were to
                            happen, however, the Shah wondered about the resultant uses of the
                            sizable Arab forces. Where would they go, and to what purposes would
                            they be put? It was clear the Shah was concerned that a peace between
                            Israeli and Arab nations could, ironically, result in a threat by the
                            Arab nations to Iran.</p>
                        <p>Beyond that prospect, the Shah felt, the Soviet Union's large
                            shipbuilding program and presence in the Indian Ocean area were curious.
                            The prospect of Soviet control over what he (the Shah) described as the
                            triangle of Suez-Aden-Djibouti was alarming. Even worse would <pb n="4" xml:id="d6-04" facs="d6-04"/>be a Syria and Iraq joined under a Red
                            regime. It was clear to the Shah the Soviet Union wanted to penetrate
                            the Persian Gulf area. It was equally clear that the Shah was concerned,
                            in a general way, about the Soviets' behavior in the area and, more
                            specifically, about the Iraquis' "reckless behavior.</p>

                        <p>The attached report of a long talk between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> and the Shah will give you the
                            flavor of his current thinking.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's main desire is to reassure himself that he continues to have a
                            close, personal working relationship with the US President and those
                            around him. We have an interest in his feeling so because there are
                            times when the Shah is on the brink of doing something rash and when
                            only a word from the President can make him think twice. Obviously, this
                            is more an impression you convey than something you say.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Points to Avoid</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> — no point raising this
                            subject until we have some better ideas of our own. Our policy now is
                            not to kill it but to keep it alive until we can think of something for
                            it to evolve into.</p>
                        <p>2. Oil and Military Sales. These are things the Shah may raise (see
                            below), but apart from hearing him politely, you will probably find it
                            more interesting to get onto other subjects.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points</p>
                        <p>1. What does the Shah think is needed to break the Arab-Israeli impasse?
                            What does he think the US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or US,
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, France can accomplish? Where does he feel Iran's
                            interests lie? [Iran has a clandestine and a semi-official relationship
                            with Israel. For instance Iran has contracted to sell the oil for
                            Israel's Eilat Ashdad pipeline by-passing the Suez Canal, and Iran and
                            Israel clandestinely support Iraq's Kurds.] Does he see any special role
                            for Iran (mediation, resettling Palestinian refugees)?</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d7-02" facs="d7-02"/>
                        <p>2. How does he see the Soviet threat today? (He used to worry aout
                            cross-border invasion but now thinks in terms of Soviet-supported
                            radical Arabs in the Persian Gulf.) What is Iran's best response? What
                            role do his arms purchases play against the threat of subversion in the
                            Gulf? What specific threat?</p>
                        <p>3. How does the Shah see political evolution in the Persian Gulf as the
                            British prepare to pull out? (The Shah and Faisal are moving closer, but
                            the Shah probably sees Iran—not Iran and Saudi Arabia—as the keeper of
                            the peace in the Gulf. Bahrain is a critical issue: The Shah claims it,
                            would like to drop the claim because its Arab but needs a face-saving
                            way out.)</p>
                        <p>4. How does he see the new situation in Pakistan? (He was close to Ayub
                            and has had some contact with the new governing group.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Points the Shah May Raise</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Two oil problems:</p>
                        <p>a. The Shah is highly irritated at the consortium of oil companies who
                            lift and market most of his oil. He has asked them for $1 billion in
                            revenues next year, and they have offered only $900 million. He insists
                            that Iran is a crucial country, the revenues are essential for his
                            development budget and that the US Government should force the American
                            companies to meet the Shah's revenue requirements. The companies argue
                            that they are doing the best they can given their need—and the Shah's—to
                            limit the flow of oil to maintain its world price. We in the Government
                            have said that we can not force the companies to do something that they
                            do not see in their interest. I think your best answer is to say that we
                            are in frequent touch with the companies and they understand our view of
                            the national interest in a strong Iran; but in our system, government
                            just can not properly dictate to private companies.</p>
                        <p>b. In his persistent drive to increase oil exports, the Shah has proposed
                            that we revise our oil import policy so as to permit him to barter some
                            of his oil for imports of American equipment. He argues that we would
                            gain from developing an Iranian export market while he would gain from
                            acquiring essential equipment fur industrial development without having
                            to spend new foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>Last year President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> told
                            him that this would not be feasible until the current oil import
                            policies were changed and we could not change them. Now, your answer is
                            easier because you can say that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has ordered a complete review of all import
                            policy.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d7-03" facs="d7-03"/>
                        <p>2. Military Sales. The Shah may stress his desire to buy his third and
                            fourth squadrons of Phantom aircraft this year. This is part of a $600
                            million program of military purchases, contracted in 1968 and reaching
                            out over five more years. This is largely a technical problem of how you
                            fund $130 million worth of airplanes in one year when you want to keep
                            annual purchases at the $100 million level. Your best response is to
                            listen non-committally and say that you will watch this as it works its
                            way through the Pentagon. [We are having an IG meeting shortly on this
                            subject.]</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> called on the Shah
                            at the Iranian Embassy Residence the evening of April 1. They had a
                            pleasant conversation in the main drawing room of the residence.</p>
                        <p>The Shah opened the conversation by saying that he had read some of Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s articles and
                            agreed with his viewpoint. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked what particular aspects of his articles
                            the Shah had particularly noted, the Shah, after some generalization,
                            came to the point that US military strength is diluted when it is used
                            for "non-essential" problems. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked whether the Shah felt that Vietnam fell
                            in that category. The Shah said that he feels now that it does, although
                            he would not argue the earlier decision for the US to involve itself.
                            The crucial point now is for the United States to extricate itself and
                            turn the problem over to the South Vietnamese. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out that once the US
                            had committed 500,000 troops, the matter is "no longer a local issue.”
                            The Shah indicated his understanding, but said he felt the US must now
                            seek an "honorable solution.” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that is the President's policy and asked
                            the Shah how he thought it might be done. The Shah said he felt the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be the key factor in a
                            solution, and the conversation then turned to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Shah felt the Soviets are deeply disturbed about China, and he cited
                            the Soviets' unusual performance in going to the West German Government
                            to express its concern over recent Chinese aggressiveness on the Soviet
                            Chinese border. The Shah pointed out that the Soviet Union needs a
                            settlement in Vietnam, although he also said that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was almost in a position of not being
                            able to afford either a victory or a defeat in South Vietnam. He said
                            that when he had last been in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had told him that the Soviet Government does
                            want to work with the US to achieve peace.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked the Shah's
                            opinion of the Soviet leaders. The Shah described Brezhnev as a "Slav”,
                            a "Russian”, and noted that he was primarily a party man. He spoke of
                            Podgorny, pointing to his head and shaking his head, indicating that he
                            wasn't very smart. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he had heard the same about Brezhnev, the
                            Shah said, not to the same extent. ”</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d8-02" facs="d8-02"/>
                        <p>The Shah said that he felt the current collegial leadership is more
                            venturesome than Stalin had been. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed but suggested that the real danger from
                            the Soviet Union is not so much that its leaders will do something rash
                            as it is that they will get themselves into something that they do not
                            know how to extricate themselves from. But he agreed generally, though
                            noting some exceptions such as Hitler where one-man rule proved highly
                            dangerous. The Shah had said that where one man alone ruled, he is
                            normally much more cautious.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that the
                            Soviet Union's position in the Near East is one example of a situation
                            that it has got itself into but may not know how to draw back from to
                            avoid danger. He asked the Shah what he thought the Soviets' objectives
                            there are, and the Shah, noting long Soviet interests in a strong
                            influence in that part of the world, said he thought they were trying to
                            dominate the Mediterranean by establishing control over a triangle with
                            its points at Suez, Aden and Djibouti. The Shah felt that they wanted to
                            get the Suez Canal open largely to consolidate their control in the Red
                            Sea and to ease their access to the Indian Ocean and ultimately to the
                            Persian Gulf. The Shah felt that the main Soviet motive in trying to
                            reach an Arab-Israeli settlement was to free the energies and troops of
                            the radical Arabs for use elsewhere, such as against Libya and, again,
                            eventually in the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Shah indicated that he had discussed Israel's position with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>. He felt that the
                            Israelis are still "drunk" with their victory and must get over their
                            "euphoria" before the Arabs learn how to make effective military use of
                            what will soon be 120 million people.</p>
                        <p>The Shah, when asked about what he thought about the Mid-East four-power
                            negotiations, said he felt they provided a useful cover for US-Soviet
                            talks. He indicated that he felt the latter were by far the more
                            important. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            asked whether he felt that a consensus among the great powers would be
                            of any value, the Shah indicated that he felt it would be useful, but he
                            also noted that lines drawn on a map by powers outside the area were not
                            necessarily the most viable. <pb n="3" xml:id="d8-03" facs="d8-03"/>The
                            Shah spoke of his high regard for King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and implied that he was in a very shaky position
                            because his country was one drawn by outsiders and not really a stable
                            entity in itself. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            asked whether the Shah felt the people of the Near East needed to fear
                            some sort of US-Soviet deal that would work to their disadvantage. The
                            Shah said he did not feel so because the US is not the kind of nation to
                            sell out its friends.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted the difficulty
                            of trying to work out a peace that would prevent the Arabs from simply
                            getting ready to attack again. He wondered whether we could hope for
                            anything better than the current situation between India and Pakistan.
                            The Shah felt that, if a good refugee settlement could be part of the
                            overall arrangements, we need not necessarily fear that a peace
                            settlement still contained in it the seeds of another war.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation drew to a close, the Shah mentioned his concern about
                            two oil matters. First, he noted his desire to sell oil to the United
                            States in return for the export of American industrial equipment.
                            Second, he went on at some modest length about the injustice of the oil
                            consortium taking oil and supplying so much in revenue to small Arab
                            sheikdoms that had no great use for it while they refused to increase
                            the Shah's revenues to the point necessary to support Iran's explosive
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the conversation, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to
                            talk with the Shah. He noted that we had planned to arrange a visit for
                            the Shah. The Shah said that close consultation is extremely important
                            since we are "natural allies" and needed to coordinate our policies "for
                            the next four, hopefully eight, years.”</p>
                        <p>As we were walking to the door, the Shah noted that the King of Greece is
                            discouraged over his present situation and was looking for a ray of hope
                            from us. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked
                            how we might supply that hope, the Shah suggested that we talk with the
                            King. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he would
                            try to.</p>

                        <p>The Shah reviewed Iran's growing internal strength. He mentioned Iran's
                            10-percent annual economic growth rate for the last four years and
                            outlined such reforms as land distribution, nationalization of forests
                            and water resources, women's rights and the establishment of various
                            development corps, including girls' corps.</p>
                        <p>At the two ends of Asia, the Shah said, there are two strong countries:
                            Japan and Iran. In between there is unfortunately much instability and
                            poverty. Progress has been made to some degree in India, but wretched
                            poverty prevails there. Iran's friend and ally, Pakistan, is plagued
                            with corruption among high public officials and is paying the price for
                            this corruption. He had warned his friend Ayub about this. He is
                            somewhat optimistic about the new leadership, saying that <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">YAHYA KHAN</persName> is a "clean" man. The Shah
                            also noted that Iran had assisted Pakistan during the Indo-Pak war but
                            that Iran's friendship had not been reciprocated in such matters as
                            relations with the Arab world and Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that able leadership is an essential ingredient
                            for any country. He asked the Shah's views on Soviet-Chinese
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The Shah responded that he has long been aware of the threat of Communist
                            China and had mentioned this to the Russians some years ago. The
                            Russians were, however, slow to realize the nature of the threat. On his
                            last visit to the Soviet Union in 1968 the Russians mentioned the
                            necessity for "white men" to guard against this peril. The Secretary
                            noted that the Soviets had recently given us a note on this subject, and
                            he and the Shah agreed that it is remarkable that the Soviets have taken
                            this matter up with the Germans.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d9-02" facs="d9-02"/>
                        <p>The Shah then described Iran's foreign policy of "independent
                            nationalism.” He stressed Iran's desire to be self-reliant. Naturally
                            Iran, like every country, had to have friends and does have friends, but
                            no country can expect its friends to come directly to its aid more than
                            once or twice. He emphasized that Iranians and Americans think alike and
                            react alike. "Iran and the United States,” he said, "are natural allies,
                            no doubt.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there can be no doubt about that. He mentioned that he
                            had attended <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings during the
                            EISENHOWER Administration and knew of the dangers confronting Iran then
                            and the progress Iran had made since that time.</p>
                        <p>Describing Iran's relations with the Soviet Union, the Shah said that the
                            Soviets had twice, once in Stalin's time and once in Khrushchev's, tried
                            to absorb Iran. Nevertheless, Iran had tried to establish normal,
                            neighborly relations with the Soviet Union. But the Soviets should have
                            no question in their mind that Iran is a strong and independent country.
                            And Iran would continue to keep its guard up, both through
                            counter-intelligence operations against Russians working in Iran and by
                            continuing cooperation in such matters with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Going on to a discussion of the Middle East as a whole, the Shah
                            mentioned Soviet attempts immediately after the Second World War to gain
                            a base at the Dardanelles or to obtain a mandate over Libya or Eritrea.
                            He referred to historical Russian efforts to obtain warm-water ports. He
                            said that together with Iran, Israel could be considered a strong force
                            in the area, but the Israelis' are preoccupied with the Arabs and he
                            sees no early solution of that problem. (He commented parenthetically
                            that no solution was possible without a solution of the refugee problem.
                            He also said he agrees with present US policy, implying concurrence with
                            the four-power approach. The Secretary said we must try every possible
                            avenue, and the Shah agreed while saying that he is not optimistic about
                            an early solution.)</p>
                        <p>Even if there should be a solution of the Arab-Israeli problem, the Shah
                            continued, there would arise the question of where all the arms supplied
                            by the Soviets to NASSER would be used. The danger was that they would
                            be used in the Red Sea area, in Yemen and Aden and eventually around to
                            the Persian Gulf. This possibility, he said, had been of concern to him
                            for a long time. He feels that there is a continuing Russian-Nasserist
                            threat to the Suez-Aden-Djibouti triangle and in due course to the
                            Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Shah reviewed the situation in the Gulf itself. He said that Iran
                            desired to cooperate with the Arabs on the other side of the Gulf and
                            had indicated a willingness to enter into an informal or a formal
                            agrement or alliance: "whatever they want.” Of great importance is
                            Iran's relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Shah said that King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> is a good and wise man and
                            that progress is being made internally in Saudi Arabia. He said that
                            Iran is, however, having some problems with the British over certain
                            islands in the Gulf which they had taken from Iran and now, as they are
                            about to leave the Gulf, want to hand over to the Arabs. The Shah
                            indicated that he had no intention of permitting the British to do this.
                            with respect to Bahrain he said he had said publicly <pb n="3" xml:id="d9-03" facs="d9-03"/>that he would let the people decide
                            whether they wanted to be part of Iran or not. This was a generous
                            offer, and Iran had no intention of using force on Bahrain. He had made
                            the offer despite the prospect of adverse repercussions in Iran; he had
                            been pleased to note the absence of such repercussions.</p>
                        <p>Summarizing his view of the situation in the Gulf, the Shah said that
                            whatever the outcome of Iran's current efforts to establish close
                            relations with the Arabs on the other side and to resolve outstanding
                            disputes, it was essential for Iran to have the strength to keep open
                            the Strait of Hormoz and to protect Iran's commerce in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would appreciate the Shah's comments on our
                            bilateral relations. Before getting into specific matters (see separate
                            memcons concerning oil and military sales), the Shah commented on US
                            policy in Southeast Asia. He said that he had originally been a "hawk,”
                            but that was before the turn for the better in Indonesia. Before then,
                            he felt that we had to fight the Communists in Vietnam if we were to
                            keep the Chinese Communists from taking over all of Southeast Asia,
                            including eventually the Philippines. Now the situation is somewhat
                            different, with the US bogged down in Vietnam. Referring to Iran's quick
                            and forceful action in retaking Azerbaijan in 1946, the Shah said that
                            it might have been better if the US had moved more rapidly and with
                            greater force to counter the North Vietnamese. The US, in the Shah's
                            view, had shown too many scruples in Vietnam. It was also a mistake, in
                            the Shah's view, for the US to oust Diem who wasa strong leader and was
                            making some progress in combatting corruption.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he too had not approved of the gradual
                            escalation of the Vietnamese war. Regarding Diem, the Secretary
                            questioned whether the US had ousted him, but agreed that the US should
                            not interfere in the internal politics of other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Shah commented, and the Secretary agreed, that it was unlikely that
                            the US would want to get involved in many more Vietnams. The
                            conversation throughout was friendly and warm, with a number of
                            injections of humor on both sides. The Secretary mentioned his looking
                            forward to visiting Tehran in May, and the Shah said he was looking
                            forward to receiving him at that time.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was devoted to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969
                            military credit sales program for Iran. The discussion focused on the
                            Country Director's paper, with factual appendices, circulated prior to
                            the meeting (<gloss target="#t_NSCIGNEA1">NSCIG/NEA</gloss> 69-9).</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed that our military credit sales program is the touchstone
                            of our special relationship with Iran, which provides us with a variety
                            of benefits in the political and security fields. Iran's support for the
                            US position on numerous international questions and our own ability to
                            influence the Government of Iran on regional matters (such as on a
                            policy to promote peace and stability in the Persian Gulf) are valuable
                            political assets. Our close relationship with Iran provides us with easy
                            overflight and transit rights for US military aircraft, staging rights,
                            and the hospitality of Iranian soil for important communications and
                            intelligence facilities. Our military mission in Iran, whose continuance
                            depends very largely on our ability to maintain a satisfactory military
                            credit sales program, is the best channel we have to influence Iranian
                            military thinking and specifically to limit pressures to divert Iran's
                            resources unnecessarily to military purposes. The Group agreed that the
                            importance of our ties with Iran has increased following Britain's
                            announcement of its withdrawal from the Persian Gulf by the end of 1971,
                            continuing Soviet inroads in the Middle East, instability in the Arab
                            world, and recent events affecting the maintenance of US facilities in
                            neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> noted that close
                            collaboration between the United States and Iran is important for our
                            ability to play an effective role in the area. The recent conclusion by
                            Iran and Saudi Arabia of an agreement over the median line in the
                            Persian Gulf was made possible, in part, by our good relationship with
                            both countries. We are now trying to play a useful role regarding the
                            future status of Bahrein. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> stated that the Shah will be looking at our
                            decision regarding military credit sales as a sign of the new
                            Administration's attitude toward Iran.</p>
                        <p>Economic Factors. The Group noted the indications that Iran's economy is
                            still booming. Real <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> has increased at
                            an average annual rate of about ten percent over the last four years.
                            Oil revenues have continued to rise, although not as fast as the Shah
                            would have liked. Iran estimates its annual growth at 9.4 percent during
                            the period of its <pb n="2" xml:id="d10-02" facs="d10-02"/>fourth 5-year
                            plan, the first year of which has just been completed. Our Embassy in
                            Tehran believes this rate is attainable. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> believe
                            that Iran's economy is likely to grow somewhat more slowly, i.e., 7-8
                            percent a year, but even at that pace Iran's progress would be
                            outstanding.</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed that, although Iran's economic progress has been
                            unusually rapid, certain warning signs have developed. These include a
                            decline in foreign exchange reserves, a growing debt service ratio, a
                            substantial and rapid increase in budget outlay for military purposes,
                            and a fairly static situation in agricultural output. Progress has been
                            made in education and health, but much more remains to be done.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> stated that the
                            adverse financial trends arise largely out of Iran's desire to press
                            ahead as fast as possible with both internal economic development and
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed, that the key question is whether the increase in Iran's
                            income from oil will keep pace with the Shah's demands and Iran's
                            expenditures. The annual disputes between the Government of Iran and the
                            oil Consortium on the levels of oil exports and revenues are a matter of
                            considerable concern. A breakdown in the Consortium-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> relationship would endanger Iran's
                            economic development and military programs as well as our own past major
                            investment in Iran. In particular, the Group noted that shortfalls in
                            the Shah's expectations for oil revenues should not mean that the
                            development program would take the major reduction in favor of external
                            defense expenditure, since the Shah's basic long-term security depends
                            largely on economic and social development.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> noted that Iran's
                            continued firm commitment to a vigorous economic development program is
                            indicated by a recent shift of personnel which has brought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">MEHDI SAMII</persName>, perhaps Iran's soundest
                            financial leader, to the head of its Plan Organization.</p>
                        <p>The Group emphasized the importance of the continuing annual <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            reviews of Iran's economic situation and its ability to finance its
                            proposed military program. The is of the review recently concluded
                            indicate that Iran's economy can carry the additional burden of a $100
                            million credit for military purchases from the United States this year,
                            despite the matters for concern noted above. The annual economic review
                            should continue to be a key part of our consideration of Iran's military
                            purchases from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed that at the present time Iran is not "diverting its own
                            resources to unnecessary military expenditures to a degree which
                            materially interferes with its development.” This is the language of
                            Section 35(A) of the Foreign Military Sales Act. The statement is
                            considered valid Whether or not Iran is properly to be considered a
                            "developed" or a "less developed" country under the <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> Act.</p>

                        <p>Military Factors. The Group noted the following important factors
                            influencing the Shah's thinking on Iran's military requirements: (1) the
                            inherent Soviet threat to Iran remains; (2) the Persian Gulf is Iran's
                            lifeline, and he is concerned over the possible opportunities for
                            radical Arab inroads in the Gulf, possibly Soviet-encouraged,
                            particularly after the British depart in 1971; and ( ) Iran must be able
                            to defend itself in the region. Noting these concerns of the Shah, the
                            Group agreed that it is in the interest of the United States to maintain
                            strong ties and effective influence with Iran, the most powerful Persian
                            Gulf nation, and to encourage it to play a statesmanlike and
                            constructive role in the Gulf. In this regard, it is important that Iran
                            make a major effort to obtain the cooperation of other littoral states,
                            particularly Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed to recommend the sale this year of two F-4 squadrons
                            desired by the Shah as a supplement to the two squadrons which we agreed
                            to sell in 1966. The two additional F-4 s uadrons are intended as a
                            response to any possible threat posed to Iran b, surface forces
                            intruding into the Gulf, as well as against missile oats reportedly to
                            be delivered to Iraq by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. These
                            aircraft, which have been recommended in the Persian Gulf Defense Study
                            we carried nut at the Shah's request, will take the place of a
                            land-based missile system originally desired by the Shah. The Group
                            agreed that it is in our interest to meet the Shah's request for
                            delivery of the two additional F-4 squadrons by the end of 1971 when the
                            British forces will leave the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Group noted that Iran continues to need US technicians (at <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cost) for the first two squadrons of
                            F-4's. It was greed that, if requested by Iran, we make available for
                            one additional year approximately 50 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technicians for duty in Iran on the understanding they
                            would be replaced by civilian technicians thereafter if needed by
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed that certain lesser items desired by Iran should also be
                            sold this year by the United States in addition to the two F-4
                            squadrons. These items might include an oil tanker, a floating crane,
                            variable depth sonar installations, 18 Sheridan tanks and communications
                            equipment, and a few other items, with an estimated Cost of slightly
                            under $20 million.</p>
                        <p>Amount and Terms of Sale. The Group agreed, to recommend a <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 military credit sale to Iran of $100
                            million of which at least $80 million should be applied toward the cost
                            of F-4's and the remainder for other items. In considering lower and
                            higher alternatives for the 1969 military sales credit figure, the Group
                            concluded that $100 Million was appropriate, among other reasons so as
                            to avoid breaking through that annual planning ceiling with regard to
                            subsequent years and also so as to meet a minimum requirement for the
                            continuance of our relationship with the Shah.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d10-04" facs="d10-04"/>
                        <p>Having in mind the desire of the Bureau of the Budget to reduce actual
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 obligations below the sum
                            authorized by Congress, the Group agreed, that the $100 million credit
                            package proposed for Iran in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969
                            should include a private credit component of at least $20 million to be
                            guaranteed by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. The balance would
                            be in <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> direct credit by the US
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> noted the
                            considerable importance attached by the Government of Iran to obtaining
                            what it considers to be a satisfactory. overall interest rate for the
                            credit sales package. The Iranians have indicated their desire for an
                            overall rate no higher than 6 percent. The Treasury representative noted
                            that the present cost of money to the Treasury is 6k percent. The
                            National Advisory Council had approved a guideline that in cases of
                            mixed private and government credit the weighted average interest rate
                            should not be less than the cost of money to the Treasury except in
                            exceptional situations. This guideline anticipates that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> direct credit can be extended at below
                            61/4 percent so as to bring the overall package rate to that level. The
                            Treasury representative estimated that, given the rates now prevailing
                            in the private money market, which would apply to the $20 million
                            minimum of private credit proposed for Iran, it would cost the US
                            Government. some $3 million to subsidize the direct government loan for
                            the remainder of the $100 million package in order to bring the overall
                            weighted average interest rate down to 6 1/4 percent.</p>
                        <p>The Group agreed, that instructions should be given to the US negotiators
                            to offer $80 million in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit at
                            61/4 percent and to offer a <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            guarantee for private credit of $20 million at the current market rate.
                            (The estimated average weighted interest for the total package in that
                            event would be about 6-3/4 percent.) The Group agreed, however, that the
                            question of the interest rate could be critical to the successful
                            conclusion of negotiations with Iran, and that if it were determined
                            necessary for successful negotiations, the interest rate for the direct
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> portion of the total credit
                            should be reduced sufficiently to. bring the overall weighted rate down
                            to 6 1/4 percent.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> (military
                            assistance) representatives noted that we could meet two additional
                            conditions set by the Governrment of Iran for including some private
                            credit in the total package: (1) the sums borrowed from private sources
                            would not be taken from already agreed COI lines of credit in US banks,
                            and (2) the sums borrowed privately for military purchases would be
                            outside the ceiling prescribed in Federal Reserve guidelines on foreign
                            lending by private US banks. While these points can be accommodated
                            within our current policy and operating guidelines, the details would
                            have to be worked out in actual negotiations with the private banks.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d10-05" facs="d10-05"/>
                        <p>It had been estimated that it would cost Iran some $130 million for the
                            two additional F-4 squadrons if ordered before June 1969. In view of the
                            proposed limit of $100 million on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1969 military sales credit, it had been proposed that the Government of
                            Iran commit itself by a "Dependable Undertaking" for the total cost of
                            the F-4's, but allocate only $80 million for that purpose out of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 credit. Such an arrangement
                            would permit Iran to utilize the remaining $20 million credit for other
                            items in 1969. If there is a <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> military sales credit, Iran
                            could use it to pay off the balance of the undertaking for the F-4's; if
                            not, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would borrow commercially
                            pay the balance out of its own funds, or could cancel the contract. The
                            Group agreed to recommend this procedure.</p>
                        <p>Summary Recommendations. The Group agreed to submit the following
                            recommendations for approval by higher authority:</p>
                        <p>1) Extend to the Government of Iran (<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>), in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969, $100 million
                            in foreign military sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>)
                            credits.</p>
                        <p>2) Authorize the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to purchase two
                            additional squadrons of F-4 aircraft through the Department of Defense
                            on the basis of a "Dependable Undertaking" with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> utilizing at least $80 million of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 credit to meet payments on
                            this undertaking.</p>
                        <p>3) Authorize the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to utilize up to $20
                            million of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 credit for defense
                            items to be agreed upon in addition to the F-4's.</p>
                        <p>4) Provide the $100 million credit in a mix of direct <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-guaranteed private credit in proportions to be
                            determined in the negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, but with at least $20 million to be <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-guaranteed private credit.</p>
                        <p>5) Seek <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> acceptance of an interest
                            rate of 61/4 percent (cost of money to the Treasury) for the direct
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit, and the current market
                            rate for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-guaranteed private
                            credit. However, if necessary for the conclusion of negotiations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, the interest rate for the
                            direct FMS credit should be reduced to a level needed to bring the
                            overall average rate for the total $100 million credit down to 6 1/4
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>6) If the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> so requests, offer to make
                            available for another year. approximately 50 U.S. Air Force technicians

                            thereafter civilian technicians may have to be utilized.</p>
                        <p>7) After Executive Branch approval of this program and before its
                            presentation to the Shah, undertake consultations to apprise appropriate
                            +/embers of Congress of the program and obtain sympathetic understanding
                            of our reasons for undertaking it.</p>

                        <p>8) Instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>, when
                            presenting the program to Shah, to include appropriate remarks touching
                            on Iran's economic situation, GOt obligations under the "Dependable
                            Undertaking" for the F-4's, and the purposes for which the funds are
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>9) Make a finding, if needed, that Iran is not diverting its own
                            resources to unnecessary military expenditures to a degree which
                            materially interferes with its development. </p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: POSSIBILITY THAT FLARE-UP IN SHATT AL ARAB MAY HAVE REPERCUSSION
                            ON HEALTHY US-IRAN RELATIONSHIP HAS DISTURBED SHAH. HE HAS BEEN GIVEN
                            EXPLANATION THAT, ALTHOUGH NO <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            INSTRUCTIONS BEEN RECEIVED, EMBASSY IS CONCERNED BECAUSE OF KNOWN
                            SENSITIVITY THESE DAYS, PARTICULARLY ON CAPITOL HILL, TO THINGS MILITARY
                            AND INTEREST OF WHOLE WORLD IN AVOIDING NEW AREAS OF CONFLICT.
                            LIKELIHOOD IS THAT IRAN WILL UNDERTAKE TEST VOYAGE DOWN SHATT BUT HOPE
                            IS THAT INCIDENT WILL NOT CAUSE WIDER FLARE-UP.</p>
                        <p>1. CALLING ME TO HIS HOME EARLY MORNING EIGHTEENTH, ACTING FORNMIN AFSHAR
                            SAID HE WANTED TO DISCUSS BREWING IRAN-IRAQ CRISIS IN SHATT AREA. HE
                            OPENED BY STATING IRAN'S POSITION THAT 1937 SHATT TREATY IS INVALID: A)
                            BECAUSE IRAQIS NEVER CARRIED OUT PROVISION FOR JOINT COMMISSION ON
                            ADMINISTRATION WHICH WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONE YEAR: AND B) BECAUSE
                            NO RECKONING OF SHATT TRANSIT DUES RECEIVED AND DISPENSED BY IRAQIS HAD
                            EVER BEEN PROVIDED IRAN.</p>
                        <p>2. ASKED RE STATUS OF THIS IRANIAN POSITION VIS-A-VIS IRAQIS, AFSHAR SAID
                            FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER ARAM HAD TWICE MADE PUBLIC <pb n="2" xml:id="d11-02" facs="d11-02"/>STATEMENTS DECLARING 1937 TREATY
                            INVALID AND UNDERSECRETARY KHALATBARY HAD VERBALLY APPRISED IRAQIS
                            DURING HIS RECENT BAGHDAD VISIT. SUBSEQUENT TO KHALATRARY VIST, IRAQIS
                            HAD NOTIFIED IRAN OF THEIR INTENTION TO INSPECT SHIPS BOUND TO AND FROM
                            IRANIAN PORTS.</p>
                        <p>3. ACCORDING TO AFSHAR, SPECIFICS CURRENT IRANIAN POSITION ARE: A)
                            IRANIAN FLAG MUST BE FLOWN BY ALL IRANIAN-BOUND SHIPS WHILE THEY ARE IN
                            "IRANIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS" I.E. IRANIAN SIDE OF THALWEG: B) IRAN WILL
                            BROOK NO INSPECTION BY IRAQIS: C) TO ASSURE IRANIAN “RIGHTS" IRANIAN
                            NAVAL ESCORTS WILL BE PROVIDED: D) PREVIOUS PROCEDURE OF USING IRAQI
                            PILOTS WILL BE OBSERVED ALTHOUGH IRANIAN EMERGENCY STANDBY PILOTS ARE TO
                            BE AVAILABLE: AND E) IRAN IS NOT RAISING QUESTION AS TO DUES.</p>
                        <p>4. AS TEST CASE, AFSHAR SAID, IRAN IS PLANNING TO SEND IRANIAN SHIP DOWN
                            SHATT "IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS" CARRYING IRANIAN FLAG AND WITH NAVAL
                            ESCORT. IRAQIS AWARE 0F THIS, HE SAID, AND HAVE SERVED NOTICE THEY WILL
                            BOARD SHIP AND REMOVE ANY IRANIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL.</p>
                        <p>5. AFSHAR THEN CAME TO MAIN POINT, CERTAIN REMARKS I HAD MADE PREVIOUS
                            EVENING TO GENERAL FAZELI, HE SAID, HAD BEEN REPORTED TO SHAH IN TUNISIA
                            (TEHRAN 1367). IN NUTSHELL FAZELI HAD REPORTED MY SAYING THAT IF
                            SHOOTING OCCURS IN SHATT ALL US MILITARY SUPPORT FOR IRAN WILL BE
                            TERMINATED. THIS HAD IRKED SHAH WHO HAD SENT MESSAGE TO AFSHAR TO ASK ME
                            FOR EXPLANATION. SHAH ADDED HE DOUBTED I WOULD HAVE SO SPOKEN. SHAH ALSO
                            ADDED THAT IF FAZELI'S REPORT CORRECT, AFSHAR SHOULD ASK ME WHETHER SHAH
                            IN ASSURING IRAN'S LEGITIMATE SELF-DEFENSE SHOULD SEEK SUPPLIES FROM
                            QUARTERS WHERE NO CONDITIONS ATTACHED.</p>
                        <p>6. IN RESPONDING I SAID FAZELI'S REPORT INACCURATE. NOTING THAT I UNDER
                            NO INSTRUCTIONS, I HAD MERELY VOICED TO FAZELI CERTAIN CONCERNS AS TRUE
                            FRIEND OF SHAH AND IRAN. I ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT DECISION AS TO WHAT TO
                            DO OR NOT TO DO IN SHATT IS STRICTLY FOR IRAN TO MAKE.</p>
                        <p>7. SHAH'S AND IRAN'S PRESTIGE, I TOLD <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">AFSHAR</persName>, HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER IN US, AND I RELUCTANT TO
                            SEE IT TARNISHED IN <pb n="3" xml:id="d11-03" facs="d11-03"/>ANY WAY.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IS COUNTING HEAVILY ON SHAH'S
                            STATESMANSHIP IN MIDEAST. FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT AT PRESENT TIME THERE
                            IS UNPRECEDENTED SENSITIVITY IN US RE THINGS MILITARY. SENATE IS MAKING
                            INTENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS AND THIS MORNING BBC REPORTED SECRETARY
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">LAIRD</persName> ALSO SETTING UP
                            INVESTIGATION OF MILITARY FACTOR IN SOCIETY. BESIDES THIS OUR NEW
                            MILITARY CREDIT SALES TRANCHE MUST BE CLEARED WITH CONGRESS. WHOLE WORLD
                            I NOTED, IS DEEPLY DEPRESSED BY TENACIOUSNESS OF TENSIONS IN VARIOUS
                            REGIONS AND NO ONE WOULD WELCOME OUT- BREAK OF NEW AREA OF CONFLICT.
                            WITH THIS BACKGROUND, I WAS VOICING DEEP CONCERN THAT ANY SHOOTING IN
                            SHATT COULD HAVE EFFECT IN CONGRESS AND COULD CAUSE TROUBLE FOR FINE US-
                            IRAN RELATIONSHIP EXISTING. IT WAS THIS CONCERN I HAD TRIED TO CONVEY TO
                            FAZELI IN EXPRESSING FERVENT HOPE THERE WOULD BE NO SHOOTING IN SHATT. I
                            ADDED THAT PUEBLO AND RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INCIDENTS IN KOREAN WATERS
                            WERE MUCH MORE FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF A NATION'S RIGHTS THAN SHATT
                            TREATY DISPTUTE BUT SECRETARY ROGERS POINTED OUT IT BEHOOVES STRONG
                            NATIONS TO EXERCISE FORBEARANCE. AFSHAR SEEMED SYMPATHETIC TO THIS
                            THOUGHT, BUT OBSERVED THAT IF IT HAD BEEN FEASIBLE USG WOULD CERTAINLY
                            HAVE GIVEN PUEBLO FULL MILITARY PROTECTION.</p>
                        <p>8. IN MAKING ABOVE CASE, I NOTED THAT SOME OUTSIDERS MIGHT COUPLE SHATT
                            VIOLENCE WITH UNRELATED PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS IRAN'S BREAKING
                            OF RELATIONS WITH LEBANON AND NYT STORY PREVIOUS DAY QUOTING "IRANIAN
                            SOURCE" IN WASHINGTON TO EFFECT IRAN PREPARED TO "SEIZE" CONSORTIUM
                            INSTALLATIONS. RE: LATTER, I NOTED WORD "SEIZE" IS LIKE RED FLAG TO
                            CONGRESSMEN THESE DAYS, IN VIEW OF PERUVIAN OIL CRISIS WHICH BEEN
                            GETTING FRONT-PAGE ATTENTION IN US.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d11-04" facs="d11-04"/>
                        <p>9. AFSHAR NOTED THAT IRAQIS IRRESPONSIBLE, WHICH ASSESSMENT WE SHOULD
                            SHARE AFTER BAGHDAD CUT RELATIONS WITH US. I AGREED IRAQIS BEEN NO RPT
                            NO PARTICULAR FRIENDS OF OURS, BUT DOUBTED ANTIPATHIES WHICH MIGHT EXIST
                            IN <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> RE IRAQ WOULD SUPERCEDE OUR
                            PROFOUND REGRET TO SEE NEW AREA OF CONFLICT EMERGE.</p>
                        <p>10. DURING DISCUSSION, I TOLD AFSHAR OF MY CONCERN THAT FREQUENTLY
                            INACCURATE AND HIGHLY INFLAMMATORY REPORTS HAVE MOVED FROM LOWER
                            ESCHELONS IN SHATT AREA TO DECISION-MAKERS IN TEHRAN. MY COLLEAGUES, I
                            SAID, ARE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS TO AVOID UNDUE INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENTS IN
                            SHATT AREA SO I NOT RPT NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, BUT
                            TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO THERE HAD COME TO MY ATTENTION FROM OTHER
                            DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES INDICATIONS THAT TEHRAN WAS BEING FED INFORMATION
                            RE IRAQI MILITARY DISPOSITIONS CONSIDERABLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE FACTS.
                            HOPEFULLY, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WOULD BASE ITS CRITICAL
                            DECISIONS, ONLY ON INFO CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AND CONFIRMED.</p>
                        <p>11. ALSO RAISED QUESTION AS TO WHAT CAPTAIN OF THIRD COUNTRY SHIP SHOULD
                            DO WHEN CONFRONTED AT FAO BY CONFLICTING ORDERS RE FLAG. <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">AFSHAR</persName> SAID IRANI'S POSITION IS CLEAR,
                            I.E. IRANIAN FLAG MUST BE FLOWN IN IRANIAN "TERRITORIAL WATERS”. <pb n="5" xml:id="d11-05" facs="d11-05"/>WHEN I ASKED WHETHER CAPTAIN
                            MUST DECIDE ON WHICH SIDE OF THALWEG HE IS AND MUST CHANGE FLAGS EVERY
                            TIME HE CROSSES IT, <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">AFSHAR</persName>
                            ACKNOWLEDGED IRAN HAS NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT YET
                            COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS QUESTION BUT HE WOULD LET ME KNOW THE ANSWER AT
                            AN EARLY DATE. I POINTED OUT THIS IS LEGITIMATE INTEREST FOR AMBASSADOR
                            OF ANY MARITIME NATION.</p>
                        <p>12. CONVERSATION WAS AMICABLE AND IN CONCLUSION AFSHAR AGREED TO DO HIS
                            BEST TO KEEP SHAH CALM. I REITERATED I WAS SPEAKING AS SHAH'S CLOSE
                            PERSONAL FRIEND WHO WISHED TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS ARISING IN HEALTHY
                            US-IRAN RELATIONSHIP. <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">AFSHAR</persName> SAID
                            HE CONFIDENT SHAH RECIPROCATES THIS FRIENDLY REGARD, CITING AS EVIDENCE
                            SHAH'S INDICATION OF DOUBT THAT I HAD SAID EXACTLY WHAT HAD BEEN
                            REPORTED IN TELEGRAM TO HIM. IN LEAVING, AFSHAR AND I SHARED HOPE THAT
                            NO <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NO SHOOTING WOULD TAKE PLACE. HE
                            ASSURED ME THAT IF ANY DID, IRAN WOULD ONLY BE ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE
                            AND I SAID WHATEVER DECISIONS ARE MADE IRAN SHOULD ASSURE THAT ITS CASE
                            WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE READY SUPPORT OF PEACE-MINDED WORLD.</p>
                        <p>13. COMMENT: NO DOUBT INJECTION OF QUESTION OUR MILITARY RELATIONSHIP HAS
                            STRUCK SENSITIVE NERVE, PARTICULARLY AS JAZZED UP FOR SHAH BY FORNMIN
                            ZAHEDI WHO IS ACCOMPANYING HIM. HOWEVER, IT SEEMED UNWISE TO IGNORE
                            FACTOR WHICH WILL UNDOUBTEDLY COMPLICATE US-IRANIAN RELATIONSHIP IF
                            HOSTILITIES BREAK OUT IN SHATT REGION.</p>
                        <p>14. SINCE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> IS DETERMINED TO FORCE
                            ISSUE OF CARRYING FLAG, AT LEAST IN TEST CASE, WE DOUBT SHAH WILL
                            RESCIND ORDERS FOR IRANIAN SHIP TO PROCEED DOWN SHATT. IT WAS
                            INTERESTING NOTE THAT WHILE FAZELI HAD INDICATED SHIP WOULD MOVE "WITHIN
                            DAY OR SO”, <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">AFSHAR</persName> INDICATED IT
                            MIGHT BE THREE OR FOUR DAYS. SO PERHAPS SOME SLOWING DOWN OF IRANIAN
                            GUNGHOISM IS ALREADY TAKING EFFECT. WE MUST HOPE THAT WHATEVER INCIDENT
                            MIGHT ACCOMPANY TEST CASE WOULD NOT CAUSE LARGER FLARE-UP.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Shatt al-Arab Crisis Flares Again. After a ten-year period of quiescence,
                            the long-standing dispute between Iran and Iraq over the Shatt al-Arab
                            once again precipitated a crisis. In its lower portion the river forms
                            the boundary between Iran and Iraq. With a few exceptions, this
                            boundary, as most recently stipulated in the treaty between Iran and
                            Iraq of 1937, lies along the low water mark on the Iranian side. The
                            river thus is for the most part Iraqi internal waters even where it
                            forms the boundary between the two countries. This state of affairs has
                            long been galling to the Iranians. In addition, the Basra Port Authority
                            has continued to provide pilots for vessels travelling in the river and
                            to collect all dues, although the 1937 treaty foresaw the conclusion
                            within one year of a convention dealing with the maintenance of the
                            navigable channel, pilotage, dues and similar matters. Iran has tried on
                            various occasions to renegotiate this treaty, but has never been
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>Also, Tehran has during past crises used the argument that the treaty was
                            no longer applicable, mainly because of non-implementation by Iraq and
                            because it constituted a remnant of "British colonialism.”</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d12-02" facs="d12-02"/>
                        <p>When the crisis passed, conditions generally returned to the status
                            before the crisis and the question of continued applicability of the
                            treaty was no longer raised. In the present instance Iran has again put
                            the validity of the treaty into question.</p>
                        <p>Present Crisis Sparked By Iraqi Demands. The present flareup in the Shatt
                            probably had its immediate cause, following a period of heightening
                            tensions, in Iraqi insistence that it had a right to inspect ships of
                            Iranian and foreign registry in the Shatt al-Arab. Iran reacted
                            strongly, alleged Iraqi military moves (so far unconfirmed),and
                            concentrated land and naval forces in the area. Iran also has mounted a
                            test case by providing a military escort for an Iranian vessel flying
                            the Iranian flag and sailing down the Shatt to the Persian Gulf. This
                            ship was not challenged by the Iraqis but it remains to be seen whether
                            this particular voyage will establish the precedent which the Iranians
                            are seeking. The vessel was less than the 1,000 tons which the Iraqis
                            may regard as maximum for ships to pass unchallenged.</p>
                        <p>Iran Declares the 1937 Treaty Void. In a speech before the Iranian Senate
                            on April 19, Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Amir
                                Khosrow Afshar</persName> stated that Iraq had "itself repudiated
                            the main provisions of the 1937 agreement" and that the Iranian
                            government therefore regarded the treaty as "null and void”. <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> added several other reasons why
                            the treaty should be considered abrogated. Among these were that
                            circumstances had changed since 1937 and that it had been concluded at a
                            time when "British colonialism was at its height…forcing Iran under
                            pressure to sign the 'agreement…” Finally <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> made the point that the Shatt al-Arab as a great
                            navigable river should not be under the control of one party and <pb n="3" xml:id="d12-03" facs="d12-03"/>that both Iran and Iraq should
                            have equal rights regarding the river. <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>'s statement appears to cumulate various earlier
                            arguments against the continued validity of the 1937 treaty.</p>
                        <p>Likely Iranian Motivation in the Latest Crisis. The latest crisis over
                            the Shatt al-Arab has been characterized so far by relative Iraqi
                            moderation and Iranian belligerence. It is unlikely that Iran actually
                            wants to provoke a military showdown. More likely, the Iranians are
                            taking this occasion to draw attention once more to the unsatisfactory
                            situation in the Shatt and force a renegotiation of the 1937 treaty.
                            This may also be the aim of <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>'s declaration that the treaty is null and void.
                            In any renegotiation the main Iranian goal would be to have the boundary
                            with Iraq shifted to the thalweg in the river. The problems of pilotage
                            and of a division of dues, while important, are probably regarded by the
                            Iranians as less vital. It is at least doubtful whether the present weak
                            government of Iraq could undertake so important a negotiating venture
                            even if it were willing to do so. A formal abrogation of the 1937 treaty
                            without replacement by another instrument would raise serious questions
                            about the boundary as well as navigation in the Shatt.</p>
                        <p>Situation May Return to Its Previous Status. If tempers cool, the
                            situation may revert to the status before the latest crisis, that is the
                            Basra Port Authority will control pilotage and collect dues as
                            heretofore and the question of the validity of the 1937 treaty will once
                            again become dormant. Unless the two countries achieve a solution of
                            this long-standing and involved dispute at some time, however, crises
                            will recur, and by miscalculation or design some such crisis might reach
                            dangerous proportions.</p>

                            recommendation (Tab B) that we now go ahead with the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 sale of military equipment to Iran
                            under the Foreign Military Sales Act. This is a yearly slice of a
                            program that has been going on under a general memo of understanding at
                            the rate of about $100 million a year since 1964. This year's package,
                            which includes some F-4, F-5 and C-130 aircraft and tanks, is part of
                            the Shah's broad military modernization program.</p>
                        <p>The general issue since this program began has been its effect on the
                            Iranian economy. So far it has proved financially manageable, but Iran's
                            future financial soundness is still fragile, depending as it still does
                            on the continued flow of oil revenues at a high level. The Shah annually
                            squeezes the American oil companies as hard as he can to maximize those
                            revenues, and if he squeezes to the breaking point or overprograms his
                            income, repayments on these military sales credits would become a
                            serious burden. For this year, this problem still seems under
                            control.</p>
                        <p>The specific issues in this proposal are fairly technical:</p>
                        <p>1. Defense proposes to maximize the use of private bank credit in order
                            to stretch its own appropriated funds. This is a sensible direction in
                            which to go and is consistent with your general desire to increase
                            private involvement, but it creates a second issue—</p>
                        <p>2. Using private bank credit naturally raises the interest rate because
                            of the current high price of money. If we need 100% U.S. Government
                            credit, the interest rate would come out about 6.25%. Private rates are
                            around 8%, and when we mix public and private credit the rate averages
                            out between. In this case, the interest rate is an issue with the Shah
                            because the Russians and others make attractive lower offers, and he
                            does not see why his friends cannot do as well. Therefore, State
                            recommends <pb n="2" xml:id="d13-02" facs="d13-02"/>staying as close to
                            6.25% as possible. The Budget Bureau, however, recommends (Memo at Tab
                            A) that we not make a special effort to keep the interest rate down
                            because Iran can afford to pay and by the criteria in our legislation we
                            must limit concessional lending mainly to those who need it for economic
                            reasons. Of course, it is tempting to try to give the Shah what he
                            wants, but there is an element of bargaining in his position too.</p>
                        <p>We cannot ask you to make a judgment on the precise division between
                            private and Government credit or about the interest rates. However, it
                            is probably desirable in relaying your decision on this memo to note
                            these problems in order to stiffen the spines of our negotiators. A mere
                            suggestion that you are aware of the budgetary implications will keep
                            them as alert to our financial interests as they will be to Iran's.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you approve Secretary Rogers' proposal and that we
                            note in relaying your decision to State your recognition of the
                            desirability of using private credit to the maximum extent possible and
                            of minimizing the use of concessional credit.</p>

                            Foreign Military Sales Act, to finance 32 F-4E aircraft and other items

                        <p>Discussion:</p>
                        <p>Beginning in 1964 we have been shifting our military assistance to Iran
                            from a grant to a credit basis. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969
                            is the last fiscal year in which we will supply military materiel to
                            Iran on a grant basis, although we will continue to provide military
                            training and support for our Military Assistance Advisory Group under
                            the grant program. Since 1964 we have extended $400 million in direct
                            and guaranteed military credits to assist the modernization of Iran's
                            military forces. The principal equipment items financed under this
                            program have been 32 F-4D aircraft, now being delivered, 26 F-5
                            aircraft, 460 M-60 tanks, 22 C-130 aircraft and 16 Sheridan tanks.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d13-04" facs="d13-04"/>
                        <p>After approval by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and satisfactory Congressional consultations we
                            informed the Shah in May, 1968 that the Executive Branch would undertake
                            annually for the next five years to seek Congressional authority and
                            appropriations for such credit sales as both governments would agree
                            were indicated to carry out a military modernization program for Iran.
                            The amount of credit to be extended each year, as well as the amount of
                            sales to be made for cash, would be subject to an annual military and
                            economic review with the Government of Iran. The Shah was informed that
                            the actual amount and the terms of each annual credit would depend on
                            the amount of credit authorization and appropriations approved by the
                            Congress, on prevailing credit market factors and on other United States
                            requirements worldwide. We subsequently agreed with the Government of
                            Iran on a tentative figure, strictly for planning purposes, of $100
                            million in annual credits.</p>
                        <p>Our military credit sales program is the touchstone of our close
                            relationship with Iran. This relationship provides us with ready means
                            for influencing Iran on international matters, particularly the
                            promotion of peace and stability in the Persian Gulf area, and for
                            limiting pressures to divert Iran's resources unnecessarily to military
                            purposes. Our relationship also provides us with other benefits,
                            including overflight privileges and communications and intelligence
                            facilities. The importance of our ties with Iran has increased as a
                            result of the announced withdrawal of British forces from the Gulf in
                            1971, the growing Soviet threat to the Middle East, the continuing
                            instability of the Arab world and recent events affecting the
                            maintenance of our facilities in neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's military modernization program is based in large part on his
                            belief that threats to Iran are most likely to materialize in ways which
                            would not justify direct United States involvement on Iran's side. He is
                            particularly interested in protecting Iran's vital Persian Gulf lifeline
                                <pb n="5" xml:id="d13-05" facs="d13-05"/>after the British depart.
                            While having demonstrated a desire to cooperate with the other Gulf
                            powers and to work for solutions of outstanding problems between them,
                            the Shah wishes to have the military power to defend, if necessary,
                            Iran's lifeline against radical Arab, possibly Soviet-inspired,
                            penetration of the Gulf and to deter sneak attacks on Iran's oil
                            installations in the Gulf area. His program attaches highest priority to
                            the Iranian Air Force.</p>
                        <p>Following British withdrawal from the Gulf Iran will be the dominant
                            military power there. This could create concern among Iran's neighbors
                            in the Gulf. However, for our part, we find Iran's present policy in the
                            Gulf essentially reassuring and our ability to encourage constructive
                            Iranian policies there enhanced by our close military relationship. </p>
                        <p>Iran's economy is booming, with its real <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> having increased at an average annual rate of about 10%
                            over the last four years. Some of the strains which such a growth rate
                            can be expected to cause have become evident, particularly in declining
                            foreign exchange reserves and a growing debt service ratio. Overall
                            military expenditures, in large part related to our credit sales
                            program, have been rising rapidly. These factors will be kept under
                            review in connection with possible future military credits to Iran. A
                            key question is whether Iran's oil income will keep pace with the Shah's
                            demands and Iran's expenditures. A breakdown in the relationship between
                            the oil Consortium and Iran would endanger Iran's economic development
                            and military programs. In this light, the current negotiation between
                            Iran and the Consortium is a matter for concern.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969
                            program would not cause a significant slowing in Iran's rate of economic
                            growth and that Iran's debt servicing burden would continue to be
                            manageable. Section 35(a) of the Foreign Military Sales Act prohibits
                            sales to any economically less developed country when the President
                            finds that such country "is <pb n="6" xml:id="d13-06" facs="d13-06"/>diverting its resources to unnecessary military expenditures to a
                            degree which materially interferes with its development.” It is our
                            opinion that Iran is not in violation of Section 35(a) at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we believe that our proposed program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 will assist the maintenance of our close ties with
                            Iran, promote our important interests in the area and meet the Shah's
                            desires.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1969 Program</p>
                        <p>The proposed program, as approved by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Interdepartmental Group for the Near East and South
                            Asia, contains the following elements:</p>
                        <p>1. Extension of $100 million in credits, at least $20 million of which
                            would be <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> guaranteed private bank
                            credit, if arrangements can be worked out with the banks, with the
                            remainder (or the entire $100 million in the event arrangements for
                            private credit cannot be worked out with the banks) being direct <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit. Funds for direct <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit and for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> guarantee of private credits have been
                            authorized and appropriated by the Congress and are available for this
                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. At least $80 million of the credit would be used to finance two
                            squadrons of 16 aircraft each of F-4E aircraft. The total cost of these
                            aircraft is estimated at $130 million, and the Government of Iran would
                            sign a dependable undertaking to finance the remaining cost estimated at
                            about $50 million. If we decide to provide additional military credits
                            to Iran in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970, such credits could be
                            used to finance this remaining cost. This "split financing" is desirable
                            in order to permit ordering of all 32 aircraft prior to June 1, when
                            substantial price increases are anticipated, and to permit financing
                            this year of up to $20 million of other items, while at the same time
                            keeping within our $100 million annual planning ceiling.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d13-07" facs="d13-07"/>
                        <p>3. Up to $20 million of the $100 million in credits would cover the cost
                            of other equipment to be agreed. Iran has indicated a desire to purchase
                            additional electronic equipment for its Persian Gulf defense, logistics
                            ships for its navy and additional Sheridan tanks to add mobility to its
                            ground forces.</p>
                        <p>4. We would seek Iran's acceptance of an interest rate of no less than
                            6.25 percent (cost of money to the Treasury) for the direct <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit and of the current market rate
                            (not to exceed 8 percent) for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-guaranteed private credit. It is likely, however, that the
                            Iranian negotiators will strongly object to these terms and will insist
                            on a lower interest rate. In order not to dilute the political benefits
                            we hope to obtain from this program, our negotiators would be
                            authorized, if necessary to complete the negotiation, to agree to
                            reducing the interest rate for direct <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit to a level needed to bring the overall average
                            rate for the total $100 million credit down to no less than 6.25
                            percent. This could involve a total loss of interest receipts to the
                            Treasury of up to $3 million during the course of the credit. This
                            procedure is consonant with State-Defense-Treasury guidelines on
                            financial standards and criteria for foreign military sales. (The
                            Treasury Department has indicated that it would prefer the interest
                            differential, if any, to be subsidized by an addition to military grant
                            aid rather than by a concessionary interest rate on the direct credit,
                            but this does not appear feasible, at least in this fiscal year.)</p>
                        <p>5. The provision for the possible inclusion of guaranteed private credits
                            in the $100 million credit package has been made in an effort to save
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> budgeted funds, because we have
                            to set aside only 25 percent of such credits in a guarantee reserve, and
                            these are not expended unless there is a default. However, arrangements
                            to this end have not yet been worked out with the banks.</p>
                        <p>6. In presenting the program to the Shah, our Ambassador would be
                            instructed to note that it is a token <pb n="8" xml:id="d13-08" facs="d13-08"/>of our confidence in the Shah and in Iran's desire to
                            contribute to the stability of the area and to urge that Iran's economic
                            progress not be adversely affected by her military expenditures. He
                            would make clear that we cannot guarantee the availability of future
                            credits in advance of Congressional authorization and appropriations or
                            of our annual economic review and that to the extent we cannot extend
                            such credits, Iran will have to finance the remaining cost of the F-4's
                            being partially financed under this program or cancel the contract.</p>

                                Imminent</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The two months moratorium agreed upon on March 10 at the first session of
                            the talks between the Oil Consortium and Iran is ended and the
                            all-important second round is scheduled to begin May 11. The "breathing
                            spell" has been marked by intense behind-the-scene negotiations as each
                            side has sought to shore up its position. At the same time, however,
                            there has been genuine effort at finding a compromise solution and the
                            gap between the two parties doesn't seem as wide as in March although
                            serious differences remain unresolved.</p>
                        <p>Iran Requests Increase in Revenues. The basic Iranian position is that
                            Iran must receive $1 billion in oil revenue for the current Iranian year
                            1348 (March 21, 1969-March 20, 1970). The Shah has indicated that he is
                            personally committed to the $1 billion figure and that even $5 million
                            less will be unacceptable. By investing his own prestige the Shah has
                            served notice that this demand is a fundamental issue in the
                            negotiations. Thus the Consortium will be under intense pressure to
                            satisfy this revenue demand in some manner.</p>
                        <p>Consortium Fears Escalating Demands. Consortium officials have flatly
                            stated that $1 billion from crude offtake alone is an impossible
                            requirement to meet and that Iran must accept this position. <pb n="2" xml:id="d14-02" facs="d14-02"/>They have, therefore, been thinking
                            in terms of increasing their planned offtake revenue $25 million above
                            the $900 million they were prepared to offer in March. The gap between
                            this figure and the $1 billion the Shah is demanding would be made up in
                            the form of an advance cash payment to be repaid during the course of
                            1349. The Consortium is reluctant to be even this forthcoming since the
                            oil companies fear that to satisfy the Shah's demands this year will
                            merely whet his appetite for further increases in revenues in the years
                            to come. However, the Shah may not consider this offer satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The oil companies are especially worried over the level of projected oil
                            revenues that the Iranian Plan Organization has postulated for the
                            remaining years of the Fourth Five Year Plan. The Consortium claims that
                            these projected revenue levels are completely unrealistic and that they
                            are in no way obliged to meet them since the oil companies were not
                            involved during the preparation of the Fourth Plan goals. Thus, one of
                            the points which the Consortium has been insisting must be included in
                            an agreement on the revenue level for 1348 is a reduction of these
                            projected-payments for future years. There is a strong feeling within
                            the Consortium that little is to be gained by meeting the Shah's demands
                            this year if similar crises are going to be encountered annually.</p>
                        <p>Breakdown in Negotiations Could Have Serious Consequences. If earlier
                            crises in Consortium-government relations are any guide, a compromise
                            solution will probably be found eventually. Should the negotiations
                            break down or become stalemated, however, the impact <pb n="3" xml:id="d14-03" facs="d14-03"/>could be far-reaching. The Shah has
                            threatened several actions if his demands are not met. Prominent among
                            these is a take-over by the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) of 50%
                            of the Consortium's operations with the oil thus obtained being marketed
                            by NIOC. Such a take-over would, no doubt, be unacceptable to the oil
                            companies and they would take various counter-measures, probably
                            including legal action. The dispute would be likely to draw in sooner or
                            later the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US as home
                            governments of most of the Consortium members and thereby affect
                            relations between them and Iran. The relationship between the oil
                            companies and the governments of other oil producing countries could
                            also be affected. Again judging by earlier experiences, however, it is
                            not unlikely that other Persian Gulf oil-producing countries, such as
                            Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi would try to take advantage of a
                            conflict between Iran and the Consortium to increase their own exports
                            and revenues. It is this prospect, incidentally, which might dissuade
                            Iran from letting negotiations break down.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Begin FYI. Iranian government and Consortium agreed 14 May on revenue
                            to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for year ending March 31, 1970.
                            Agreement provides that revenue from offtake will be "about dollars 930
                            million”, a 10 percent increase over year ending March 31, 1969. In
                            addition Consortium will make interest free advance of "about dollars 80
                            million" in March 1970 so that total <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            revenue from Consortium will probably be slightly over dollars one
                            billion demanded by Shah for current Iranian fiscal year 1348. </p>
                        <p>2. Proposed advance repayable June through August 1970, but because of
                            impact of this repayment on revenue for Iranian year 1349, Consortium
                            would be "willing … to review with Iran on a realistic basis the offtake
                            and revenue position for 1349, and, <pb n="2" xml:id="d15-02" facs="d15-02"/>… possible adoption of a similar advance procedure
                            for end of that year (March 1971). Such a review could be repeated in …
                            each of two following years.” Consortium has thus attempted to link
                            renewal of the original advance with lowering rate of increase of
                            Iranian revenue demands for following years.</p>
                        <p>3. Export capacity to be 4.5 million b/d by beginning 1971.</p>
                        <p>4. Further discussions re Iranian revenue demands for remaining years of
                            five-year Plan will be held in October.</p>
                        <p>5. Consortium's position remained basically the same throughout
                            discussion with final agreement for this year little changed from
                            proposals made to NIOC 11 May at start of talks. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>6. If in your judgment occasion arises you may tell local sources we
                            believe projected production targets for this year in Iran agreed upon
                            by Consortium do not repeat not pose serious threat to revenue goals
                            which Consortium member companies have told other Persian Gulf producers
                            they will attempt to reach in their respective countries. Terms of
                            Consortium's concession agreement have not been altered. We believe <pb n="3" xml:id="d15-03" facs="d15-03"/>Consortium member companies
                            have keen awareness of their interests and responsibilities in all Gulf
                            states, and we do not expect that new arrangements with Iran will affect
                            existing off-take pattern in neighborning states.</p>

                            HAVE PICKED UP QUOTES FROM UK PRESS AND HERALDED THEM AS IRANIAN VICTORY

                            NEGOTIATIONS THOUGH RECOGNIZING THAT LITTLE PROGRESS MADE IN EDUCATING
                            IRANIANS AND NEXT YEAR'S NEGOTIATIONS PROBABLY EQUALLY DIFFICULT.

                        <p>I. BECAUSE OF HOLIDAYS, MAY 17 PAPERS PROVIDED FIRST IRANIAN PRESS
                            REACTION WHICH WAS MODERATE, AND CONSISTENT WITH TONE OF NIOC
                            COMMUNIQUE. LATTER MERELY SAID NEGOTIATIONS CARRIED ON IN ATMOSPHERE OF
                            UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION, "AGREEMENT REACHED WITH RESPECT TO
                            GOVERNMENT'U 1348 REVENUE REQUIREMENTS" AND THAT IT ALSO AGREED FURTHER
                            TALKS TO BE HELD LATER FOR REVIEW OF FUTURE POSITION. MAY 17 EDITORIALS
                            REMINDED READERS IRAN ITSELF WILL DECIDE WHEN AND HOW MUCH IS TO BE
                            PRODUCED <pb n="2" xml:id="d16-02" facs="d16-02"/>BUT PAPERS PLEASED
                            BREAKDOWNS IN NEGOTIATIONS AND SERIOUS SUBSEQUENT REPERCUSSIONS AVOIDED.
                            HEADLINES MAY 18, HOWEVER, PICK UP QUOTES FROM <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> PRESS AND ASSERTION "SHAH WINS BATTLE FOR OIL REVENUS.”
                            ARTICLES SAY IRAN SECURED BILLION-DOLLAR INCOME FOR 1348 COMPOSED OF
                            REVENUE AND INTEREST-FREE ADVANCES. SO FAR PRESS HAS NOT CARRIED ANY
                            EXCERPTS SHAH'S SOMEWHAT SOUR COMMENTS TO TIMES CORRESPONDENT DURDIN
                            (TEHRAN 1872).</p>
                        <p>2. IF SHAH DISAPPOINTED, AMERICAN REPS, ON OTHER HAND (PARKHURST AND
                            MOSES), LEFT TEHRAN QUITE SATISFIED AND VERY GRATEFUL TO AMBASSADOR
                            MEYER FOR HIS VIGOROUS ENDORSEMENT DIRECTLY TO SHAH (TEHRAN 1795) AND
                            SUBSEQUENTLY TO SHAH THROUGH ALAM (TEHRAN 1826) OF CONSORTIUM PROPOSALS.
                            COMPANY REPS ADMITTED, HOWEVER, LITTLE PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN EDUCATIVE
                            PROCESS MAKING IRANIANS UNDERSTAND IMPOSSIBILITY COMPANIES PROVIDING
                            FIRM PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE REVENUES OVER TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD. THUS
                            MOSES AND AND PARKHURST ACCEPT RESIGNEDLY PROSPECT THAT NEXT YEAR WILL
                            BRING ANOTHER ROUND EQUALLY DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. THROUGHOUT NEGOTIATIONS CONSORTIUM REPS STROVE UNDERLINE FACT THAT
                            REVENUE FIGURES MENTIONED WERE ESTIMATE ONLY. THEY ADMITTED THAT ON THIS
                            ISSUE CONSORTIUM AND NIOC TALKING ON DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THAT SUMS
                            MENTIONED WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE REGARDED BY IRANIANS AS COMMITMENTS.
                            IRANIAN MONEY SHORTAGE, ENGAGEMENT SHAH'S PRESTIGE AND MOUNTING IRANIAN
                            IMPATIENCE WITH CONSORTIUM POSITION HAVE GREATLY STRENGTHENED IRANIAN
                            CONVICTION (AS AGAINST PREVIOUS YEARS) THAT AMOUNTS MENTIONED MUST BE
                            FORTHCOMING FROM CONSORTIUM.</p>
                        <p>4. TWO THOUGHTS FOR FUTURE OCCUR TO US: (A) BUILDING ON FAVORABLE COMPANY
                            ATTITUDES BECAUSE OUR VIGOROUS SUPPORT FOR THEIR FINAL POSITION, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MIGHT LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES COMING
                            MONTHS TO STRESS TO US MEMBERS OUR HOPE COMPANIES WILL INDEED DO THEIR
                            BEST MEET $930 MILLION REVENUE LEVEL DURING 1348: KLUCONSORTIUM MEMBERS
                            MIGHT CONSIDER PAVING WAY FOR OCTOBER NEGOTIATIONS BY TRYING TO BRIDGE
                            COMMUNICATIONS GAP WITH SHAH. THUS WE WOULD HOPE COMPANIES COULD
                            ENCOURAGE AUTHORIZED SPOKESMEN (PERHAPS JUST O'BRIEN OR ADDISON)
                            PERIODICALLY TO DISCUSS INFORMALLY WITH SHAH WORLD OIL SUPPLY/ DEMAND
                            TRENDS AND OTHER INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT NECESSARILY <pb n="3" xml:id="d16-03" facs="d16-03"/>GOING INTO ACTUAL CONSORTIUM
                            OPERATIONS. VISITS BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS SUCH AS SHELL CHAIRMAN BARRAN
                            HAVE DRAWBACKS (BARRAN MAY HAVE AROUSED SOME UNJUSTIFIED OPTIMISM) YET
                            SUCH ENCOUNTERS HAVE ADVANTAGE ALSO IN LETTING SHAH KNOW HE HAS FRIENDS
                            INTERESTED IN KEEPING HIM INFORMED AND WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH IRANIAN
                            PROGRESS AND WELFARE. DESIRABILITY SUCH VISIT WOULD BE HEIGHTENED SHOULD
                            SHAH, AS HIS INTERVIEW WITH DURDIN MAY IMPLY INTEND CONTINUE WITHOUT
                            LET-UP PROGRAM OF ACTIVE PRESSURE ON COMPANIES.</p>

                            LEADERSHIP IN GULF. RISKS OF CONFLICT WERE KEPT LOW. TENSION HAS ABATED.
                            NEGOTIATIONS UNLIKELY SOON BUT IRAN HAS ESTABLISHED NEW RIVER REGIME FOR
                            IRANIAN SHIPS WHOLLY OWNED AND CHARTERED IRANIAN DETERMINATION TO PRESS
                            FOR "RIGHTS" IN GULF PROBABLY STRONGER.</p>

                        <p>2. ALTHOUGH IRAQI GOVT IN THIS AS IN OTHER MATTERS HAS BEEN UNDIPLOMATIC,
                            INSENSITIVE, AND BRUSQUE, CONFRONTATION WAS PRESSED BY IRAN. ISSUE WAS
                            JOINED BY IRANIAN DENUNCIATION OF 1937 TREATY WHICH TOOK PLACE SOME TIME
                            SHORTLY AFTER ABORTIVE KHALATBARY MISSION TO BAGHDAD (JAN-27-FEB-12),
                            (A-173). DIPLOMATIC WORD BATTLE ENSUED AND IRAQIS IRRITATED IRANIANS BY

                            IRANIAN RIVER CRAFT SOME TIME IN LATE MARCH (TEHRAN 1170). IRAQIS MADE
                            MAJOR DIPLOMATIC GAFF APRIL 15 BY INDICATING INTENTION TO SEARCH IRANIAN
                            VESSELS AND TO RESORT TO USE OF FORCE IF NEEDED TO REMOVE IMPROPERLY
                            FLOWN IRANIAN FLAG AND IRANIAN NAVAL PERSONNEL FROM MERCHANT SHIPS
                            (NEVER CLEAR JUST WHAT THIS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO IN IRAQI MIND).
                            HOWEVER, IRAQI POSITION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RATHER TRANSPARENT BLUSTER.
                            WE HAVE NO INDICATION IRAQIS MADE ANY TROOP DISPOSITIONS AT THIS TIME TO
                            LEND FORCE TO WORDS AND IRAQI GOVT HASTENED TO TERM UNFORTUANATE
                            STATEMENT A "MISTAKE" APRIL 17 (TEHRAN 1399 NOTAL). IRANIAN GOVT IGNORED
                            RETRACTION AND ISSUED PUBLIC TREATY DENUNCIATION APRIL 19. MOREOVER,
                            THROUGHOUT MARCH AND APRIL, IRANIAN TRANSFERS OF FORCES INTO KHUZISTAN

                            PROBABLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE OF IRAQI INACTION. IT
                            IS ALSO CLEAR THAT, ALTHOUGH IRANIANS TOOK SOMEWHAT RISKY ACTION OF

                            CASES, ALL IRANIAN FORCES WERE UNDER STRICTEST INJUNCTIONS NEITHER TO
                            PROVOKE IRAQIS NOR TO FIRE EXCEPT IN DEFENSE (QUITE POSSIBLE PARTIALLY

                            OUR DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT, ALTHOUGH SHATT CRISES IN PAST YEARS GAVE
                            BASES FOR PLANNING AND EXPECTATIONS, IRAINIANS HAD NOT <pb n="3" xml:id="d17-03" facs="d17-03"/>THOUGHT MATTER THROUGH VERY
                            THOROUGHLY. IN ACTUALITY, SOLE CHANGE THEY HAVE AFFECTED IS TO ESTABLISH
                            NEW RIVER REGIME FOR IRANIAN SHIPS WHOLLY OWNED AND CHARTERED, TO AND
                            FROM IRANIAN PORTS (IRANIAN FLAG ONLY AND IRANIAN PILOT). POSSIBLY THEY
                            COUNT ON THIS NEW STATUS QUO TO VALIDATE TREATY DENUNCIATION AND HELP
                            FORCE RENEGOTIATION AT FUTURE DATE (FONOFF OFFICIALS HAVE MADE CLEAR
                            THEY DO NOT EXPECT CURRENT IRAQI GOVT TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE). BUT TO
                            GENERATE TELLING PRESSURE ON IRAQIS IN LOCAL CONTEXT OF SHATT IRAN WOULD
                            HAVE TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE OF DE FACTO RIVER REGIME FOR THIRD COUNTRY
                            SHIPPING. FOR TIME BEING THIS HAS FOUNDERED, AS IT DID IN PREVIOUS
                            YEARS, ON LACK OF IRANIAN PILOTS AND SHIPPERS' VIEW OF THEIR INSURANCE
                            PROVISIONS. STILL POSSIBLE IRAN MAY TRY TO DIVERT SOME OR ALL THIS
                            SHIPPING TO NON- SHATT PORTS AND/OR OBTAIN FEW QUALIFIED IRANIAN PILOTS
                            BUT SEEMS UNLIKELY EITHER OR BOTH COULD BE DONE IN SHORT RANGE OR
                            WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE COST AND EFFORT.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mac:</p>
                        <p>While waiting for the information promised in paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 107964, we have been considering
                            how best to manage the delicate problem of keeping a voice for the U.S.
                            in Iran's air defense deliberations at the same time not encouraging the
                            purchase of weapons or stimulating a request for a cash sale. </p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> tells us that
                            General Casbeer has found several opportunities to reiterate doubts
                            about the desirability of giving up reliance on the F-4s as Iran's
                            principal defense against air attack. However, expressions of interest
                            in point defense have continued (from General Khatemi and others) and
                            have been insistent to the point where it is obvious we will have to
                            express some willingness to consider how Iranian desires can be met or
                            we will be out of the ball game altogether. This does not mean we intend
                            to give up stressing that the F-4s plus existing AA weapons are still
                            the best defense. General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> hopes to have a chance to elaborate this view
                            again in an audience with the Shah which he is seeking for next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>This morning General <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName>
                            stated the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was about to sign letter
                            of intent for purchase of the Swiss Oerlikon and the British Rapier, an
                            indication of the speed with which the Iranians are moving. Pursuing the
                            line set out in your telegram, General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> will indicate to <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName> in general terms that we are preparing to see
                            how we might be helpful and, while no commitments can be made, it would
                            seem sensible to think of financing additional AA equipment through the
                            next increment in U.S. credit.</p>
                        <p>We think it particularly important that the Iranians be encouraged to
                            study the whole matter much more intensively than they have so far. <pb n="2" xml:id="d18-02" facs="d18-02"/>The study process should take a
                            few months, bringing us closer to the time when we will be contemplating
                            again the nature of the next increment in U.S. military credits for
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>We have even discussed the possibility of suggesting something like an
                            air defense study of the kind done on Persian Gulf defense a year ago.
                            But this was such a slow and cumbersome operation, that the General is
                            thinking of asking instead for some people to come out from the Air
                            Force to work with him in determining the character of Iranian air
                            defense needs and how they can best be met.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Shah has asked for a complete strategic review of his
                            ground forces. ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, acting
                            under <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> directives, must
                            move warily in helping in an exercise of this kind, since we do not wish
                            to seem to be accepting any inflated threat estimates the Iranians may
                            put forward. Nevertheless, such a study may offer opportunities for
                            suggesting further streamlining and improving the quality of the ground
                            element.</p>
                        <p>Along with this ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has in mind
                            reviewing the six-year Modernization Plan to see how practical it now
                            looks in the light of another year's experience. This should help also
                            in deciding how or if point defense equipment can be fitted somewhere
                            into the four annual credit tranches remaining under our current program
                            for future military sales to Iran. Our preliminary view is that they
                            could be worked in though probably some items now contemplated might
                            have to be postponed to the later years.</p>
                        <p>As you can see we are poised again on the horns of the usual dilemma. But
                            given the speed with which the Iranians seem to want to move in this
                            field, we see a need for some degree of U.S. involvement as the best
                            means of slowing the headlong rush to purchase a third country weapon
                            without full planning and appraisal. You may be sure that the General is
                            stressing, as ever, manpower shortages and citing the absurdity of
                            acquiring gear when trained men may not be on hand to operate it when it
                            arrives.</p>
                        <p>We share your aversion to Raytheon's high pressure tactics. They have
                            talked with ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and will be
                            discussing their ideas further with Embassy officers. On all of these
                            occasions we are taking the opportunity to reiterate that it is too
                            early for them to meet with the Iranians. Is there still no means by
                            which <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> can trim the sails of these
                            traveling vendors before we are prepared to see their products put
                            before the customers?</p>

                        <p>2. Iranian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> called
                            on Secretary July 14 after returning from Tehran consultations previous
                            day. Secretary began by saying President sincerely regretted not being
                            able stop in Tehran during forthcoming trip, noting Shah would be
                            visiting Washington in October. Furthermore, President hoped visit Iran
                            next year.</p>
                        <p>3. Ansary said Shah dismayed and alarmed about developments in Middle
                            East, specifically (a) recognition of East Germany by Syria, Iraq and
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and (b) Soviet shipment of four
                            squadrons of aircraft and ships to Iraq. Despite these uncertainties and
                            instability on Arab side of Persian Gulf, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> still had no reply from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to request for additional pilot training in US. Ansary
                            said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had determined it needs train
                            25 pilots formerly trained in Pakistan every year in US, in addition to
                            the 75 per year <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has promised to
                            train. Also <pb n="2" xml:id="d19-02" facs="d19-02"/> PEACE RUBY radar
                            net still "in air.” If these two items unresolved, Shah had said IIAF
                            would be "deaf and blind.” </p>
                        <p>4. Secretary said problem is that with Vietnam and many requests by other
                            countries for pilot training he was not sure extra capacity was
                            available. Country Director <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> pointed out that when <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agreed provide training for 75 pilots in 1972 and 1973
                            and for 53 pilots in 1974, it had taken into consideration that the 25
                            Iranian pilots being trained in Pakistan would cease such training in
                            October 1968. Numbers required by Iran had been worked out between Chief
                                ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> recommended that Shah's request
                            for 100 pilots per year be urgently discussed in same forum. Secretary
                            agreed. Comment: Instructions follow.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> said Shah also displeased
                            that US Ambassador, a few months ago, said US technicians could not go
                            to western Iranian airfields during Shatt crisis and function there.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> explained that <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> General <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName> had raised hypothetical question with Chief
                                Armish/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> who stated subject was
                            one requiring Ambassador's <pb n="3" xml:id="d19-03" facs="d19-03"/>and
                            Washington's instructions. After Ambassador discussed subject with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName>, latter withdrew his
                            question.Matter was never referred to Washington for decision. Secretary
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> to ensure Shah aware
                            that asking such hypothetical questions could well sour Iran's good
                            relations with the Congress. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            suggested it might get involved in local conflict in Iran — even if it
                            does not intend to — serious Congressional problems could be raised for
                            Iran. Everyone would immediately put situation into a Vietnam analogy.
                            Ansary said that since <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not have
                            relations with Iraq and does have "close relations" with Iran, Shah
                            naturally expected <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> generally favor
                            Iran. "What is use of friendship if it is not good when chips are down?"
                            In response Secretary's question whether Iran really worried about Iraq
                            since Iran much stronger, <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName>
                            could not say what countries together with Iraq would be stronger than
                            Iran. However he implied Iran worried that if Iraq has more planes than
                            its personnel can pilot and service, Soviet pilots and ground crews
                            might become involved. Secretary said our analysis is that Soviets are
                            so concerned with Chicoms they do not <pb n="4" xml:id="d19-04" facs="d19-04"/>wish serious trouble in Middle East. We see Soviet
                            remarks about possible Asian security pact also in context of Soviet
                            concern re Chicoms.</p>
                        <p>6. Ansary then said Shah had mentioned to Secretary during latter's visit
                            to Iran that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wanted to manufacture
                            its own conventional arms, but <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                            taken no action. Eliot pointed out that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> team had gone to Iran to study co-production, had only
                            recently returned, and was working to follow up results of its trip.
                            Ansary appeared unaware this visit.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> said he was
                            bringing these items to the attention of the Department since Shah will
                            want discuss them with President during his visit in October. He asked
                            that President be informed about the subjects discussed and was assured
                            that he would be.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Iranian Proposal.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Reza Fallah</persName> (the
                            Shah's oil representative) left with you (attached) makes two
                            proposals:</p>
                        <p>1. That the US give Planet Oil—an American firm which Herbert Brownell
                            represents—a quota to import 200,000 barrels of oil a day from Iran.
                            Planet would buy the Iranian oil for distribution in the US, and Iran
                            would use the proceeds only for Iranian purchases in the US. (This
                            arrangement eliminates any balance of payments loss.)</p>
                        <p>2. To further the quota request, Iran is prepared to discuss selling oil
                            to the US Government for a strategic stockpile. <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName> assumes that US domestic
                            production cannot meet an oil crisis and that storage in salt caverns
                            and mines is economic. Under this arrangement, Iran would ship oil for
                            our stockpile, for which we would pay only the actual production and
                            shipping costs and, of course, those for storage in the US. Only when
                            the oil is used would we pay Iran the difference between the production
                            costs already paid and the market price at the time we use the oil. We
                            would be buying oil for $. 40 a barrel which normally sells at around
                            $1.80. Essentially the Iranians are trying to create a situation in
                            which—at no cost to Iran—any oil coming into the US in excess of normal
                            imports would come from Iran.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Staffing in progress:</p>
                        <p>1. Substance. I have discussed this with the staff of the Cabinet Task
                            Force on Oil Import Control. Brownell had presented the request for an
                            oil import quota for Planet Oil to the Task Force last spring. The Task
                            Force is a couple of months short of making recommendations to the
                            President, and the staff at this point just doesn't know where the Task
                            Force will come down. It is impossible to judge whether the Planet
                            request for a quota has a chance until overall import policy is
                            determined. Therefore, they just don't have an answer now.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d20-02" facs="d20-02"/>
                        <p>2. Handling. I have asked State to recommend an interim acknowledgment of
                            Fallah's memo. If the Iranians have any advocates on the Task Force,
                            they are the State representatives who are designated to handle such
                            approaches and work them into the Task Force's deliberations. </p>
                        <p>3. Shah's visit. I have asked the Task Force staff to provide the basis
                            for the President's talking points for the Shah on this subject. These
                            will be explanations of some of the political problems the President has
                            with setting oil import policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What To Tell Brownell </p>
                        <p>1. You have made sure that the Task Force staff understands the Iranian
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>2. You have assured that the national security implications (friendly
                            Iran) are understood.</p>
                        <p>3. The Task Force is still a couple of months short of reaching
                            conclusions on overall oil import policy. Until they make their
                            recommendations and the President decides, we will not have a firm
                            answer.</p>
                        <p>P.S. One of the problems of the Task Force is that oil import policy
                            determinations are the subject of close political scrutiny. The Task
                            Force has operated completely in the open. A special decision in favor
                            of Planet Oil and Iran would be read as favoritism to Brownell on
                            political grounds.</p>

                                15, the Embassy reported Zelli's belief that radical U.S. student
                                groups would combine with Iranian students to mount a large protest,
                                and his request that the FBI keep demonstrations under control.
                                (Ibid., RG 59, Central Files 1967-69, POL 7 IRAN) In Telegram 3974
                                from Tehran, October 1, the Embassy anticipated a high level of
                                student protest against the Shah in the United States.

                            GULF DEPENDS FIRST AND FOREMOST ON COOPERATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN RIPARIAN
                            POWERS. INDEED WE HOPEFUL LATTER WILL SUCCEED IN EVOLVING STABLE NEW
                            SYSTEM ASSURING SECURITY AND PROGRESS OF ALL GULF STATES. NEVERTHELESS
                            US AND REST OF WORLD HAVE IMPORTANT INTEREST IN SEEING THAT AN AREA
                            CONTAINING SUCH GREAT RESOURCES DOES NOT SLIP, AS OTHERS HAVE IN
                            POST-COLONIAL ERAS, INTO STATE OF UNCERTAINTY AND CHAOS. WHILE RIPARIANS
                            MUST PLAY DOMINANT ROLE, OTHERS CAN PERHAPS BE HELPFUL ALSO. ACCORDINGLY
                            WE BELIEVE WISE NOT FORECLOSE OPTIONS WITH REGARD FUTURE USEFULNESS OF
                            FACILITIES NOW EXISTING IN GULF. IF SHAH SHOWS INCLINATION PURSUE MATTER

                            CAN FIND SOME MEANS, PERHAPS IN COLLABORATION WITH IRAQIS, ESTABLISH
                            MORE OR LESS PERMANENT NAVAL PRESENCE IN GULF. WHILE WE WOULD NOT

                            ONCE WE HAD WITHDRAWN NAVAL FORCE FROM REGION, ITS REINTRODUCTION WOULD
                            BE DIFFICULT AND OPERATION OF OVER-THE-HORIZON PRESENCE (WHICH SHAH HAS
                            MENTIONED) IMPRACTICAL. PERHAPS BEST COURSE WOULD BE SIMPLY ENDEAVOR
                            CONVINCE SHAH THAT ON THIS QUESTION OUR VIEWS ARE FLEXIBLE AND WE HOPE
                            HIS CAN REMAIN THAT WAY ALSO.</p>

                            AND IRAN'S CURRENT TIGHT FOREIGN EXCHANGE SITUATION HAS ADDED URGENCY TO

                            NIOC/CONSORTIUM TALKS IN LONDON BEGINNING OCTOBER 6 AND CONCLUDED PRIOR
                            HIS ARRIVAL US.) WHILE AWARE OF US OIL POLICY CONCERNING OPERATIONS AND

                        <p>1. SHAH OPENED BY SAYING HE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY IRAQ SITUATION AND
                            SOVIET EFFORTS TO GAIN POSITION OF PRIMARY INFLUENCE IN THAT COUNTRY.
                            WHEREAS AT PRESENT SOVIETS ARE SUPPLYING LARGELY DEFENSIVE EQUIPMENT TO
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, THEY ARE EQUIPPING IRAQ WITH
                            OFFENSIVE ARMAMENTS INCLUDING AIRCRAFT, COMAR MISSLE VESSELS, AND OTHER
                            OFFENSIVE HARDWARE. THIS IS GIVING IRAQ OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY WHICH
                            SOVIETS MIGHT AT SOME FUTURE TIME WISH TO EXPLOIT IF THEY SUCCEED IN
                            THEIR EFFORTS TO HAVE IRAQI COMMUNISTS PARTICIPATE IN A FUTURE IRAQ
                            GOVERNMENT— A STEP THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOVIET DOMINATION OF IRAQ. HE SAID
                            THERE IS PRESENTLY IN IRAQ A SOVIET NAVAL MISSION OF SEVERAL HUNDRED AND
                            THAT ONLY A WEEK OR SO AGO 170 IRAQI NAVAL PERSONNEL WENT TO SOVIET
                            UNION FOR TRAINING. GIVEN IRAQ'S VERY SHORT SEA COAST AND ITS STRICTLY
                            LIMITED TERRITORIAL WATERS, FURNISHING OF MISSLE- FIRING VESSELS, ETC.,
                            IS MOST SINISTER, PARTICULARLY SINCE SUCH OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY IS NOT
                            NEEDED, IN VIEW OF PRESENT MODEST ARRAY OF IRANIAN AND OTHER NAVAL
                            STRENGTH IN GULF. AMONG OTHER THINGS, SOVIETS DOUBTLESS LAYING
                            GROUNDWORK FOR PORT FACILITIES IN IRAQ WHICH WOULD ENABLE THEM TO
                            AUGMENT SOVIET NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF, WHICH HAD BEEN INCREASINGLY
                            EVIDENT IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS. HAVING BUILT UP A SUBSTANTIAL FORCE IN
                            THE MEDITERRANEAN OF SOME 70 VESSELS, <pb n="2" xml:id="d23-02" facs="d23-02"/>SOVIETS ARE IN PROCESS OF LAYING GROUNDWORK FOR
                            BUILD-UP OF NAVAL FORCES IN THE GULF. I COMMENTED I HAD HEARD RUMORS
                            SOVIETS WERE PLANNING TO GIVE IRAQ COMARS, HAD NOT HEARD CONFIRMATION
                            VESSELS HAD ACTUALLY BEEN DELIVERED. SHAH REPLIED VESSELS HAD BEEN
                            DELIVERED, BUT SOVIET MISSILES NOT RPT NOT YET FURNISHED. HE MENTIONED
                            THAT RECENTLY HE HAD SENT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER TO LONDON WHO HAD
                            COORDINATED ESTIMATES OF IRAQI STRENGTH WITH BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AND
                            THAT IRANIAN ESTIMATES COINCIDED VERY CLOSELY WITH BRITISH.</p>
                        <p>2. HE SAID HE HAD "NEEDLED" THE SOVIETS ABOUT THEIR SUPPLYING OFFENSIVE
                            WEAPONS TO IRAQ AND THAT SUCH ACTION NOT ONLY SUPPORTED IRAQIS IN THEIR
                            DEFENSE OF A COLONIAL-IMPOSED TREATY (SHATT-AL-ARAB), BUT WAS ALSO
                            INCONSISTENT WITH SOVIET DECLARATION OF FRIENDSHIP WITH IRAN. HOWEVER,
                            SOVIETS HAD WAFFLED AND GIVEN NO SATISFACTORY ANSWER.</p>
                        <p>3. IN LIGHT OF MILITARY BUILD-UP IN IRAQ, WITH ATTENDANT THREAT TO
                            PERSIAN GULF AND POSSIBLE FUTURE UNFRIENDLY EFFORTS BY RADICAL ARAB
                            STATES TO UNSEAT MODERATE ARAB GOVERNMENTS, IT ESSENTIAL, GIVEN BRITISH
                            WITHDRAWAL IN 1971, THAT IRAN IMPROVE ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES. THESE
                            CAPABILITIES, HE SAID, WERE NOT DESIGNED TO COPE WITH AN OVERT, ALL-OUT
                            SOVIET ATTACK, AS ONLY THE U.S. WAS IN A POSITION TO DO THAT. HOWEVER,
                            INCREASED CAPABILITIES WERE ESSENTIAL (A) TO GIVE CREDIBILITY TO IRANIAN
                            POSITION VIS-A-VIS SOVIETS THAT IRAN WOULD RESIST MILITARILY ANY ATTACK
                            FROM ANY SOURCE AND WOULD FIGHT TO END AND IN PROCESS DESTROY ITS
                            INDUSTRIAL CAPABILITY SO POTENTIAL ENEMY COULD NOT PROFIT; (B) TO DETER
                            IRAQ, WITH ITS INCREASED MILITARY CAPABILITIES, FROM MAKING
                            MISCALCULATION AND ENGAGING IN AGGRESSIVE STEPS IN GULF AND AGAINST IRAN
                            WHICH COULD ESCALATE INTO HOSTILITIES.</p>
                        <p>4. HE SAID SOME FRIENDLY OBSERVERS BELIEVED IRAN'S PRESENT TRAINING,
                            STATE OF READINESS, AND MILITARY CAPABILITIES ALREADY INFINITELY
                            SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF IRAQ. HE AGREED IRANIAN FORCES WERE BETTER TRAINED
                            AND SUPERIOR BUT IF IRAQ ENGAGED IN SURPRISE ATTACK, THE FIRST THREE
                            DAYS COULD BE CRUCIAL AND IRAQI ADVANTAGE FROM FIRST STRIKE COULD LESSEN
                            DEGREE OF IRAN'S SUPERIORITY.</p>
                        <p>5. SHAH SAID IN LIGHT FOREGOING SITUATION, HE WOULD BE <pb n="3" xml:id="d23-03" facs="d23-03"/>DISCUSSING IRAN'S MLLITARY
                            REQUIREMENTS WITH PRESIDENT NIXON AND HIS ADVISORS WHILE OVER-ALL
                            CAPABILITIES MUST BE STRENGTHENED, HE EMPHASIZED PRIORITY HE IS GIVING
                            TO BUILDING UP IRANIAN AIR STRENGTH. THIS WOULD SERVE AS GREAT DETERRENT
                            TO MISCALCULATION AND/OR AGGRESSION IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD. HOWEVER,
                            THIS AIR BUILD-UP WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PILOT TRAINING IN
                            US AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE TECHNICIANS TO TRAIN IRANIANS. HE
                            ESTIMATED IRAN WOULD PROBABLY NEED FROM SEVEN TO NINE YEARS TO FULLY
                            TRAIN ITS OWN PERSONNEL. HE WAS QUITE PREPARED TO USE A MIX OF US
                            MILITARY AND US CIVILIAN PERSONNEL (IF LATTER AVAILABLE) FOR WHICH IRAN
                            WOULD PAY (HOPEFULLY FROM INCREASED OIL SHIPMENTS TO UNITED STATES, AS
                            PER FOLLOWING MESSAGE). HE TRUSTED WE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING IN THESE
                            MATTERS.</p>
                        <p>6. HE CONCLUDED WITH GENERAL OBSERVATION THAT US HAD GONE TO GREAT
                            EXPENSE TO BUILD UP TURKISH CAPABILITIES. TO HIM IT MADE LITTLE GLOBAL
                            STRATEGIC SENSE TO BUILDUP TURKISH DEFENSES AND LEAVE RELATIVE VACUUM IN
                            IRAN WHICH NOT ONLY GUARDED TURKISH FLANK BUT THROUGH WHICH TURKEY COULD
                            BE BYPASSED BY BOTH SOVIETS AND RADICAL ARABS. HE WAS NOT ASKING FOR
                            GRANT ASSISTANCE SUCH AS WE HAD GIVEN AND CONTINUE TO GIVE TO SOME
                            COUNTRIES, BUT FOR COOPERATION, ECONOMICALLY AND MILITARILY, TO PERMIT
                            IRAN TO SHOULDER ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WITHOUT
                            HAVING TO BE DEPENDENT ON US OR OTHER GREAT POWER INTERVENTION. HE FELT
                            THAT A MOST CRITICAL PERIOD LAY AHEAD AND SINCE IRAN AND THE US SHARE
                            THE SAME BASIC OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES, CLOSER COOPERATION IN THE FUTURE
                            WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE PAST. GP-3.</p>

                        <p>1. SHAH SAID ONE IMPORTANT SUBJECT HE WOULD DISCUSS WITH PRESIDENT NIXON
                            IS IRAN'S DESIRE FOR INCREASED OIL SHIPMENTS TO U.S. IN RETURN FOR
                            IRANIAN GUARANTEE TO SPEND PROCEEDS ON U.S. MILITARY AND CIVILIAN
                            EQUIPMENT. IRAN WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH U.S. EQUIPMENT AND IN PERIOD
                            AHEAD WHEN IRAN MUST BE ELECTRIFIED AND FURTHER INDUSTRIALIZED THERE
                            WOULD BE NEED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HEAVY INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT SUCH AS
                            GENERATORS PRODUCED BY GENERAL MOTORS AND GENERAL ELECTRIC, AGRICULTURAL
                            EQUIPMENT, HEAVY INDUSTRIAL AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ETC. TO PURCHASE
                            SUCH ITEMS, AND ALSO MILITARY EQUIPMENT, FROM U.S., IRAN NEEDED TO
                            EXPAND ITS OIL SHIPMENTS TO U.S. HE FELT STRONGLY IRAN SHOULD HAVE A
                            QUOTA OR SOME SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT. WHILE AMERICAN INTERLOCUTORS HAD
                            POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT U.S. DID NOT ALLOCATE QUOTAS TO COUNTRIES BUT
                            GAVE QUOTAS TO IMPORTERS, THIS WAS NOT REALLY ACCURATE AS PROVEN BY
                            QUOTA-TYPE ARRANGEMENTS WE HAD WORKED OUT WITH VENEZUELA AND CANADA AND
                            OIL IMPORTS THAT FLOWED THROUGH VIRGIN ISLANDS BY SPECIAL TYPE
                            ARRANGEMENT WHICH WERE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULAR U.S. IMPORT QUOTA
                            LIMITATIONS. HE TRUSTED THAT SOME SUCH SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS COULD ALSO
                            BE WORKED OUT FOR IRAN.</p>
                        <p>2. IN RETURN FOR SUCH SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS, IRANIAN <pb n="2" xml:id="d24-02" facs="d24-02"/>GOVERNMENT WOULD GUARANTEE TO SPEND
                            PROCEEDS ON U.S. EQUIPMENT. HE DID NOT THINK THERE WAS ANY COUNTRY THAT
                            WAS WILLING TO MAKE SUCH A COMMITMENT AND HE REMARKED WITH A SMILE THAT
                            HE ASSUMED WE WOULD NOT BE AVERSE IN VIEW OF OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
                            PROBLEM, TO IRANIANS PURCHASES WHICH COULD RUN UP TO $400 MILLION A
                            YEAR. HE MADE CLEAR THAT HE WOULD STRESS TO PRESIDENT THAT SOME
                            ARRANGEMENT FOR INCREASED OIL EXPORTS TO THE U.S. WAS OF VITAL
                            IMPORTANCE TO IRAN AND, IN HIS JUDGEMENT, ALSO SERVED NOT ONLY
                            COMMERCIAL BUT ALSO POLITICAL INTERESTS OF THE U.S. SINCE HE KNEW WE
                            WISHED TO SEE A STRONG STABLE AND INDEPENDENT IRAN THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE
                            TO STABILITY IN THIS UNSTABLE AREA.</p>
                        <p>3. IN THIS CONNECTION, HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ONE INFORMAL
                            OBSERVATION. HE FELT THAT RATHER THAN TRYING TO TREAT ALL COUNTRIES
                            GENERALLY ALIKE, THE U.S. AND IRAN SHOULD BOTH TRY TO DEVELOP ESPECIALLY
                            CLOSE AND COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTRIES THAT SHARED THEIR
                            BASIC POLITICAL AND INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHY, AND WERE IN A POSITION TO
                            WORK TOWARDS STABILIZING AREAS THAT TODAY WERE IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION.
                            SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THIS KIND COULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN
                            DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD, WHERE THE COUNTRIES ENJOYING SUCH A
                            RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. COULD "CARRY THE BALL" AND EXERCISE AN
                            INFLUENCE FOR STABILITY AND PEACE WITHOUT THE U.S. HAVING TO BECOME TOO
                            DIRECTLY OR OVERTLY INVOLVED.</p>

                            <item>IRAN: Shah's Views of Iranian Defense Needs on the Eve of US
                                Visit</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Shah of Iran reviewed in conversations with the recently-arrived
                            American Ambassador some topics which are of most immediate concern to
                            him and his policy-makers—i.e. Persian Gulf security, Iran's defense
                            needs, and increased oil revenues. While no striking departures emerged
                            from these conversations, the general tenor reflects the Shah's concern
                            with the security of his country and his determination to provide what
                            he regards as an adequate defense against any likely external threat.
                            Most of the Shah's statements were probably aimed at setting the stage
                            for his October 21-22 visit to the US. They may also presage a period in
                            US-Iranian relations in which growing Iranian independence could result
                            in less reliance on US support and less attention to American advice,
                            especially in regional matters.</p>
                        <p>Shah Concerned About Persian Gulf. Of paramount concern to the Shah are
                            the Persian Gulf and the various forces which may play a role therein
                            following the British withdrawal scheduled for 1971. He is still wary of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and is aware that the US
                            remains the only guarantor against Soviet attack, but he also considers
                            such an attack to be a remote possibility for the foreseeable future.
                            The Shah is convinced that Iran must play the dominant role in the
                            Persian Gulf and he is determined that radical Arab or Soviet influence
                            should <pb n="2" xml:id="d25-02" facs="d25-02"/>be prevented, or at
                            least be kept to an innocuous level. He feels that neither Saudi Arabia
                            nor the various principalities can contribute significantly to the
                            control of these subversive forces and that therefore, the entire burden
                            of insuring the region's security will fall on Iran as the strongest and
                            most stable riparian power.</p>
                        <p>To meet this burden, Iran, in the Shah's opinion, will require a modern
                            and well-equipped military establishment with most of the equipment to
                            be purchased either from the US or elsewhere. Although the Shah's
                            assessment of the Persian Gulf situation and of Iran's role may be
                            overdrawn, there is no denying that he is wedded to it and that Iran has
                            the wherewithal to look to other arms sources if he decides the US is
                            not sufficiently meeting his demands for arms. Keeping such demands
                            within reasonable limits—reasonable in the sense that military
                            procurement does not become a severe strain on Iran's economic
                            development—has required major US efforts over the past few years. If
                            the Shah's stated needs—additional sophisticated aircraft, modern
                            armored equipment, and increased training of Iranian personnel—are
                            indicative of what he is likely to attempt to acquire in the near
                            future, the US may be faced with a serious problem of trying to convince
                            the Shah to keep his requests within economically manageable
                            proportions.</p>
                        <p>Military Requirements Pose Many Problems. The increased defense burden is
                            likely to create problems also in domains other than US-Iranian official
                            relations. The Shah has already stated publicly that the Iranian people
                            could look forward to a certain amount of "belt-tightening" over the
                            next few years since added expenditures will have to be devoted to the
                            military. The oil <pb n="3" xml:id="d25-03" facs="d25-03"/>companies
                            will also probably find themselves under increasing pressure to raise
                            offtake and revenue payments beyond projected levels.</p>
                        <p>Even though sharply rising military expenditures cannot but cause
                            problems for Iran internally by hindering its development plans and
                            externally by perhaps alarming and alienating its weaker Arab neighbors,
                            the Shah appears determined to follow this course. He feels that only a
                            strong deterrent posture can provide the necessary guarantee of Iran's
                            security against radical Arab nationalist incursions into the Gulf
                            region. In addition, the Shah sees Iran as the only logical successor to
                            the British in the Persian Gulf and the only riparian state that can
                            claim sufficient military and economic power to fill this role
                            successfully.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Our relations with Iran are excellent. The Shah values his connections
                            with American Presidents and will be alert to gauge whether this
                            Administration will continue the support for him and his country which
                            he considers that its predecessor showed. He will have the following two
                            questions uppermost in his mind.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Need for additional U.S. military
                            equipment</p>
                        <p>In preparation for the day when the British will leave the Persian Gulf
                            in 1971, and in light of his concern over the Soviet arms build-up of
                            certain Arab states, particularly Iraq, the Shah will state his strong
                            desire to purchase substantial amounts of new heavy military equipment
                            on favorable credit terms. Our traditional position has been to try to
                            contain the Shah's military appetite, without creating a negative
                            impression, since the need for so much additional equipment is
                            questionable in our view and its purchase diverts resources from
                            development. We suggest you tell the Shah that we believe most of Iran's
                            essential military needs can be met under the present arrangement we
                            have with Iran, whereby we have said we will attempt to provide $600
                            million <pb n="2" xml:id="d26-02" facs="d26-02"/>in credit for military
                            purchases in $100 million tranches over the period 1968-1973. You could
                            say that if the $100 million annual ceiling poses problems in placing
                            orders for certain items with long lead-times, or inhibits ability to
                            take advantage of the most advantageous prices, we will examine
                            alternative possibilities with the Shah's economic and military
                            advisers.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Increase in oil imports from Iran </p>
                        <p>The Shah will ask for special arrangements which would permit the import
                            into the U.S. of substantial amounts of Iranian oil above the
                            established import quota arrangements. He will offer an undertaking that
                            the proceeds from these exports will be spent on U.S. products. As the
                            extremely complicated matter of imports of oil into the U.S. is now
                            being studied by the special committee you have set up under Secretary
                            Shultz, and as this committee is not scheduled to finish its work for
                            several weeks, we suggest that you tell the Shah that the whole question
                            of oil imports is under careful study and that the Shah's proposals will
                            be taken into consideration. In these circumstances it is not possible
                            for you to give a definitive reply at this time.</p>
                        <p>We suggest you make the following points to the Shah:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Appreciation of Shah and gratitude for Iran's
                            role</p>
                        <p>We have a high regard for the Shah as a world statesman and a wise
                            national leader who is leading his country to stability and economic
                            well-being. We deeply appreciate the valuable international role of
                            Iran, which is a stable entity in a highly neuralgic <pb n="3" xml:id="d26-03" facs="d26-03"/>part of the world. We are also
                            grateful for valuable intelligence, communication and overflight
                            facilities which Iran provides the U.S. We hope that we may continue to
                            work as closely in the future as we have in the past toward our common
                            goal.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Iran's role in the Persian Gulf</p>
                        <p>When the Shah brings up the changing situation and Iran's role in the
                            Persian Gulf, we suggest you emphasize our belief that stability and
                            security in the Gulf is best safeguarded by cooperation among the states
                            most immediately concerned. You could say that we are encouraged by the
                            Shah's forthcoming attitude on Iran's claim to Bahrain, i.e., that Iran
                            would accept any arrangement worked out by the Secretary General of the
                            United Nations to determine the will of the people of Bahrain. We hope
                            that negotiations and accommodation will be used to deal with other
                            questions which may arise between states of the Persian Gulf, such as
                            Iran's claim to the Tunb Islands and the Island of Abu Musa, in dispute
                            with the Shaikhdoms of Ras al Khaimah and Sharja respectively. We hope,
                            too, the Shah will do everything possible to develop and improve his
                            relations with Saudi Arabia and examine what he can do to restore
                            relations with Lebanon, a break having occurred as a result of Lebanon's
                            refusing to extradite to Iran a prominent Iranian anti-regime political
                            figure, General Teimour Bakhtiar.</p>
                        <p>The Shah may reflect disappointment that we are not prepared to make
                            substantial new commitments to him at this time, although our attitude
                            will be essentially what we believe he expects to hear. It will be
                            essential to portray it to him in the most <pb n="4" xml:id="d26-04" facs="d26-04"/>constructive light in view of our valuable
                            relationship with Iran and the key role in that relationship played by
                            the Shah personally.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Although we have suggested that the President try to steer clear of
                            details of the Shah's military and oil proposals, the Shah has a way of
                            pressing hard for answers. If the going gets heavy, the President may
                            ask you on the spot what can be done or ask you to talk with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>. For that reason, you
                            may want to see or refresh your memory on the attached (though both are
                            covered generally in the briefing book):</p>
                        <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has written
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> (Tab A) urging
                            him to be as positive as possible on three Iranian military requests.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> has practical
                            problems with each:</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technicians to train Iranians in
                            the maintenance of F-4's. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> is concerned about deepening the involvement of US
                            military personnel in Iran. He would prefer that the Shah hire civilian
                            American technicians. For instance, when Iran and Iraq were at odds last
                            summer, some of our technicians were asked to move to a forward base.
                            Fortunately, the crisis ended before they had to move but <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> is concerned about the
                            implications of that sort of involvement.</p>
                        <p>b. Iranian pilot training. The Shah will probably press to increase the
                            level of pilot training in the US. While this makes sense in the
                            abstract, Secretary Laird would either have to take away training slots
                            from some other friendly country—Iran already has more than half of
                            those allotted for world-wide pilot training and we have applications we
                            cannot fill from Italy, Norway, Denmark, Morocco—or he would have to go
                            to the Congress for more money to increase this program.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d27-02" facs="d27-02"/>
                        <p>c. In-country production. The Shah is anxious to have us help increase
                            Iranian industrial capability to overhaul armored vehicles. Defense is
                            happy to help but generally wants Iran to work out details with private
                            US companies the Iranians would like Defense to negotiate for them. This
                            puts Defense in the position of choosing between US firms for foreign
                            business.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah's oil requests. You have seen the material in the briefing
                            books on this problem. You asked also, however, to see again the memo I
                            did for you after <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Reza Fallah</persName>
                            called on you in August. At Tab B is a copy of your letter to Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName> saying that his
                            proposals would be handled by the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import
                            Policy. Also there is a slightly fuller explanation of the Iranian
                            proposals but you have already seen much of this in the briefing
                            material.</p>

                        <p>The Honorable Melvin R. Laird<lb/> Secretary of Defense<lb/> Washington,
                            D.C.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mel:</p>
                        <p>I understand that you will be calling on the Shah of Iran at his request
                            on October 22. I assume your staff has drawn to your attention a number
                            of questions the Shah is likely to ask you about present and future U.S.
                            military cooperation with Iran.</p>
                        <p>A number of the Shah's questions will deal with matters somewhat in the
                            future and clearly we will not be in a position to give him definitive
                            replies at this time. Nevertheless I believe it is of great importance
                            that we leave the Shah with the clear impression that we are making a
                            determined effort to help him to continue to meet his defense needs.
                            Specifically I think it would be of great help in creating this
                            impression if you could tell him that:</p>
                        <p>(a) We will continue to send U.S. Air Force F-4 technicians to Iran to
                            train Iranians in the maintenance of F-4 aircraft for at least one more
                            year.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d28-02" facs="d28-02"/>
                        <p>(b) We will make every effort to provide for Iranian pilot training in
                            the United States at the present level (75) and consider providing for
                            an additional number of training spaces in the 1973-75 period should
                            they be required.</p>
                        <p>(c) We will cooperate with him in developing an in-country capability
                            overhaul armored vehicles and to explore with him other areas of defense
                            related maintenance or production facilities in which U.S. collaboration
                            might be feasible.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Significance of The Visit </p>
                        <p>As you know, the Shah is a man with a mission — putting Iran on its feet
                            as a modern nation before he dies.</p>
                        <p>To this end, he is subtly pressing the idea of a "special relationship"
                            with the US.</p>
                        <p>By this he means a relationship that would cause us to give Iran
                            preferred treatment—exceptions to oil import policy, a place at the top
                            of the military credit list and higher revenues from private US oil
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>In this, he is not entirely self-seeking. He is genuinely committed to
                            the West and feels the good job he is doing in Iran — "an island of
                            stability,” he calls it — is an important service to the Free World. <pb n="2" xml:id="d29-02" facs="d29-02"/>He knows that no one visit is a
                            make-or-break point in a relationship like this, but in these first
                            substantive talks with your Administration he will be trying hard to
                            nail down the principle of special relationship. As a determined man who
                            believes in his cause, he is a persistent bargainer and he will read any
                            generally sympathetic answer as assent. Precise and frank talk about how
                            far the US can and cannot go is important in avoiding later
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>Points to Stress (see also Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' memo in briefing book)</p>
                        <p>1. Continued warmth of your personal relationship, pleasure in exchanging
                            views on the world situation and interest in the latest developments in
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>2. Desire for close cooperation with Iran within limits imposed by
                            present US mood. [You might approach this by explaining in depth the
                            philosophy behind the policy stated on your Asian trip. The Shah will
                            agree and then argue that this is exactly why he seeks special
                            treatment—so Iran can save the US from involving itself in Iran's part
                            of the world. While that makes sense and we should help as much as we
                            can, the point is that the US mood which underlies your Asian statements
                            also creates strong sentiment in some quarters against military credits
                            and special import quotas. While this Administration is committed to a
                            close relationship with its friends, translating that commitment into
                            practical policies and programs is a political problem that has to be
                            worked out a step at a time in our political system. The President of
                            the US cannot make policy as easily as the imperial ruler of Iran. By
                            combining appreciation for the Shah's policy and a description of the
                            practical problems you face as a political leader, I hope you can be
                            forthcoming without letting him expect too much. ]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Points to Avoid</p>
                        <p>1. A specific commitment on either of the Shah's oil import proposals.
                            [Tabs D and E of briefing book describe fuller details and the Shah's
                            revenue problem which underlies them. In brief, they are (a) that the
                            National Iranian Oil Company through its American partner, the Planet
                            Oil Company which Herbert Brownell represents, be given an annual quota
                            for the import of oil into the United States, and <pb n="3" xml:id="d29-03" facs="d29-03"/>(b) that the United States accept an
                            Iranian proposal to sell oil for a strategic stockpile — the oil to be
                            sold at cost with Iran collecting its profit only if and when the oil is
                            used. As you know, the Cabinet Task Force on oil import policy will not
                            report its recommendations to you for another six weeks or so, and you
                            would not want to mislead the Shah to expect more than we can deliver.
                            The Task Force will consider Iran's special strategic claim on our
                            attention, but of course that is only one factor in setting oil import
                            policy.]</p>
                        <p>2. Commitment on military credits. [The US has a five-year understanding
                            with the Shah dating from June 1968 for the sale of arms at the rate of
                            about $100 million a year. But the Shah is always in the process of
                            reviewing his needs and pressing the upper limits of available US
                            credit. Our problem is simply budgetary: The Iranian credit in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 is by far the largest, taking 30% of
                            the sales budget request. You are aware of the pressures from Israel to
                            increase its share, and beyond that Iran is competing within a $350
                            million ceiling with other special cases like Taiwan, Greece and some
                            Latin Americans. Since the Shah personally oversees Iran's procurement
                            program, he has a great deal of detail at his fingertips. Your best
                            procedure is to let him discuss details with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>.]</p>
                        <p>3. Saying "we will consider" the Shah's requests. He will read that as a
                            promise to consider favorably. To avoid unpleasant misunderstanding, it
                            is best where possible to say exactly how we will handle his requests,
                            explaining where necessary why it is not possible to give a final answer
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points</p>
                        <p>1. You are sorry you could not stop in Iran at the end of your Asian
                            trip. Scheduling made it impossible. You decided that it would be better
                            to defer a visit to Iran rather than to make a quick three or four hour
                            stop. You appreciate the Shah's understanding. [In deciding not to go
                            last August, you authorized my telling the Iranians you would go next
                            year.]</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d29-04" facs="d29-04"/>
                        <p>2. You might want to give the Shah your main impressions from the Asian
                            trip leading to the following point: You are aware that the Shah for
                            some time has understood the philosophy behind your Asian policy. But
                            when you took office you were struck by the many restrictions imposed by
                            the present American mood. You deeply appreciate the Shah's
                            perceptiveness and hope he will continue to bear with us if we sometimes
                            seem unable to do all that we logically should even to give substance to
                            our own policy.</p>
                        <p>3. These comments may well lead to the oil question: You appreciate the
                            importance of oil revenues to Iran's stability, defense and growth.</p>
                        <p>a. You are aware of his proposals for increasing US import of Iranian oil
                            — the desire for an import quota and the proposal for sale to a US
                            stockpile. You want to explain where your own decision-making process on
                            oil import policy stands because our response must be consistent with
                            the new policy. The Cabinet Task Force will report in six weeks. There
                            will be a period of discussion and decision-making after that. You have
                            instructed-that national security concerns — such as those the Shah
                            argues — be worked into the Cabinet Task Force's recommendations. You
                            are sorry you cannot give him an answer now, but this is a major policy
                            review involving complex domestic and international political and
                            economic issues.</p>
                        <p>[I recommend you describe these in a general way to give the Shah the
                            impression (a) that you are grappling with a difficult political problem
                            and (b) that you appreciate the Shah's effort to cast his proposals in
                            terms in of US security and balance of payments interests. Oil import
                            policy involves balancing national security requirements — the US oil
                            reserve and cooperation with our friends — with domestic prices and the
                            interests of US companies, which vary from one section of the US to
                            another. For your background: US imports of oil will rise, but it is not
                            at all clear now that special <pb n="5" xml:id="d29-05" facs="d29-05"/>arrangements for any country outside the Western Hemisphere will be
                            desirable. On the other hand, if the US does decide to stockpile oil,
                            Iran's offer might well be competitive. ]</p>
                        <p>b. You understand the Shah's desire to maximize oil revenues for Iran's
                            development plan. [He is putting great pressure on the consortium
                            companies to increase their offtake from Iran to bridge the gap between
                            income and the Shah's development budget. ] In our free enterprise
                            system we cannot tell the oil companies what to do, although we do share
                            with the companies our view of Iran's importance. You realize-from your
                            own talks with Secretary Schultz how complicated it is to match domestic
                            economic requirements against international trends in a commodity like
                            oil. How does the Shah manage this? [The point here is to suggest subtly
                            that the Shah base his Policy toward the oil consortium on sound
                            analysis of what the world market and sensible commercial practice will
                            permit. The Shah wants more than what the companies consider Iran's
                            share of the Mid-East market and a greater production increase than
                            world demand and supply will support. We do not want to take sides. But
                            we do not want to see the Shah do anything rash. One idea is to
                            encourage him to seek from independent oil consultants a judgment on a
                            fair compromise.]</p>
                        <p>4. On military cooperation, the US will continue to help. You regard the
                            details of the program as part of a continuing discussion between our
                            respective military experts. Secretary Laird will be discussing these
                            with him further. You would only note that both the US and Iran have to
                            work with budgetary limits. You know how well the Shah understands the
                            need to balance domestic development against defense. All you can say is
                            that we shall continue to work closely with Iran in this field.</p>
                        <p>[The Shah is pressing for some help that causes problems for Defense. For
                            instance, the Shah would like more Iranian <pb n="6" xml:id="d29-06" facs="d29-06"/>pilots trained in the US. This would be nice to do,
                            but as a practical matter it would involve either cutting slots for
                            other friends — Iran already has half the slots allotted for our
                            worldwide pilot training program — or asking Congress for more money for
                            this program. The Shah would also like more <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technicians to help train Iranians in maintaining
                            their F-4s because they are cheaper than civilian contract technicians.
                            This raises the question of a deepening direct involvement in Iran. For
                            example, during Iran's brief border tension with Iraq last spring,
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technicians were asked to move
                            to forward bases. Fortunately, the incident ended before they had to
                            move.]</p>
                        <p>5. Prince Fahd when you saw him last week expressed admiration for the
                            Shah and for his statesmanship in working toward a solution of the
                            Bahrain problem. As the British move out of the Persian Gulf, you are
                            counting on the statesmanship of the Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> to make the transition
                            orderly. [Iran has an historic claim to Bahrain and three other small
                            islands in the Persian Gulf. The Shah has said he would be willing to
                            accept any arrangement the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is able to
                            work out for ascertaining the wishes of the people of Bahrain. In
                            effect, he is willing to drop Iran's claim there if he can find a
                            face-saving way to do it. The British believe they are close to
                            agreement with the Shah on Bahrain and would appreciate your encouraging
                            him to complete what is potentially a statesmanlike act in taking
                            Bahrain out of the field of controversy. The Shah still wants control of
                            the smaller islands.]</p>
                        <p>6. The Shah will be interested to hear your views on Vietnam and the
                            domestic US mood and to discuss the Middle East and East-West relations
                            (your visit to Rumania).</p>
                        <p>7. You are pleased to be cooperating with the Shah in pressing his
                            proposal (made at Harvard in June, 1968) for a universal Welfare Legion"
                            —a sort of international Peace Corps. [In your UN speech, you welcomed
                            ECOSOC study of the feasibility of this proposal, and in a September 24
                            letter you informed U Thant that Joe Blatchford would help with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> study. A decisive factor will be
                            whether the idea is acceptable in the developing world. ]</p>

                        <p>1. The Shah is, above all, interested in exchanging views on the world
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>2. He has, during his talks here at the time of General EISENHOWER's
                            funeral and in his first talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>, proposed that the US and
                            Iran develop a special working relationship. He is not talking about an
                            alliance but about very close consultation and special consideration for
                            each other's interests.</p>
                        <p>3. In this context, he will develop his two proposals on importing
                            Iranian oil into the United States and encourages the oil consortium
                            companies to increase offtake from Iran.</p>
                        <p>4. He will press for additional military equipment within our credit
                            sales program and for further help from US Air Force technicians.</p>
                        <p>5. The Shah will speak of Iran's importance as a stabilizing factor when
                            the UK pulls out of the Persian Gulf. This is a major part of his
                            argument for special US help. [Our reply is that we hope the Shah and
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> will work closely
                            for the stability of the Gulf. You were pleased to hear from Prince Fand
                            that the Saudis feel relations are good.]</p>

                        </list>
                        <p> Clark Mollenhoff in the attached explains some of the background of the
                            Shah's proposals for the US-import of Iranian oil. He understands that
                            he has been oversold on this project by a group of American
                            entrepreneurs now represented by Herbert Brownell. He points out the
                            domestic political risk of a decision on oil import policy that seemed
                            to favor one of Mr. Brownell's clients.</p>
                        <p>The background Clark describes is consistent with my information.</p>
                        <p>I would only add that the Shah has now made these proposals very much his
                            own. He is not just the dupe of American entrepreneurs, although they
                            may not have been straightforward with him in describing the US
                            difficulty in changing oil import policy. I have tried to keep Herb
                            Brownell informed on our side of the problem, but he has apparently not
                            succeeded in dampening the Shah's enthusiasm if he has tried.</p>

                            <item>Potential problem area in connection with the visit of the Shah of
                                Iran.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It is possible that the Shah of Iran may be oversold before his arrival
                            on the possibility of some changes in U.S. policy to permit Iran to
                            exchange crude oil for American goods and products.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that a Mr. Charles Allen of a firm known as "Planet Oil and
                            Mineral" has convinced the Shah that he can increase the income of Iran
                            substantially by such a change in American policy. While it would
                            probably be good U.S. policy to help the Shah in some manner, this could
                            constitute a preferential treatment that could have wide
                            repercussions.</p>
                        <p> Herbert Brownell, former Attorney General under the Eisenhower
                            Administration, represents Plant Oil and Minerals. He is apparently very
                            enthusiastic about his client's cause, and believes that it would be a
                            wise course for the United States as well as for Iran. However, I have
                            had some discussions with persons who are equally interested in good
                            relations between Iran and the United States who feel that any special
                            allocation arrangement would have some long-term bad impact, even if it
                            seemed a good thing to do to please the Shah while he is here.</p>
                        <p>It has been explained to me by some familiar with this matter that the
                            Shah is likely to be disappointed on a number of matters involving oil
                            policy while he is here and that it is important to cool his enthusiasm
                            at the earliest possible point in the one area so there will be less
                            likelihood of repercussions.</p>

                        <p>I am not familiar enough with this subject matter to have any firm
                            judgments one way or the other. It did appear to me that the warning was
                            a clear and reasonable one that should be passed on for consideration at
                            the proper level.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that Nat Samuels, a Deputy Under Secretary of State for
                            Economic Affairs, is fully conversant with this whole matter, I would
                            suggest that anyone at the White House level who deals with this subject
                            contact Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SND1">Samuels</persName> for
                            exploration of the details.</p>
                        <p>There have been some scandals involving oil allocation decisions in the
                            recent past. The press has not fully exploited those scandals, but I'm
                            sure would put the worst possible interpretation on any decisions by
                            this Administration that might be of substantial benefit to one of Mr.
                            Brownell's clients.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                        <list type="subject">
                            <head>SUBJECT:</head>
                            <item>Meeting with The Shah of Iran</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Shah and the undersigned had breakfast in the upstairs study of
                            Blair House on 22 October. The meeting lasted from 8:1O to 10:00 A.
                            M.</p>
                        <p>2. At various times during this session, the undersigned briefed the Shah
                            on subjects in which he expressed an interest: Developments in
                            Sino-Soviet relations over the past year, the Soyuz 6-7-8 manned space
                            mission (briefing memorandum attached), developments in Latin America,
                            and Soviet subversive activities in the Middle East and Western
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>3. The undersigned told the Shah that he was disturbed over the lack of
                            substantive intelligence briefing with which we had provided him over
                            the past year and that steps would be promptly taken to provide [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] material on military
                            developments in the Soviet Union and Communist China.</p>
                        <p>([<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]: Let us arrange a system
                            whereby you will be provided from [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] with periodic reports on these and other subjects
                            of interest.)</p>
                        <p>The undersigned took occasion to thank the Shah for the approval he gave
                            permitting construction of [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>] on the Persian Gulf. The Shah nodded his head,
                            expressed his interest in the project, then went on to say that as long
                            as we are not interested in having U. S. A. shining in neon lights on
                            our installations, he is prepared to have us locate in Iran almost any
                            kind of technical collection equipment we desire. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>4. In connection with the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, the Shah stated
                            that King Faysal had assured him in Rabat that if the Shah
                            satisfactorily settled the Bahrein problem, he (Faysal) would make a
                            public statement announcing that Saudi Arabia would make common cause
                            with Iran in the Gulf area. The Shah added rather mournfully that no one
                            has tried harder than he to get a satisfactory arrangement with
                            Bahrein.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d31-02" facs="d31-02"/>
                        <p>5. In discussing Iraq and the disposition of a majority of Iraqi forces
                            toward Iran, the Shah commented that he was certain Soviet intelligence
                            in Iran was spying on behalf of Iraq. He is obviously concerned about
                            Soviet build-up of Iraqi forces and wondered aloud whether they would be
                            encouraged to move against him. After some discussion of this, we agreed
                            that this was an unlikely eventuality within the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>6. Commenting on his current visit here, the Shah stated, "Relations
                            between our two countries have never been better”. He feels that he and
                            the President are agreed in their assessment of affairs in the Middle
                            East, and he believes that the President intends to help him build up
                            his air force and economy to permit Iran to be a stable force in an
                            unstable Middle East. The Shah pointed out that he must have strong air
                            power to maintain himself against irresponsible leaders in the countries
                            around him. He recognizes that due to the mountainous terrain of Iran,
                            it would be most difficult for land armies to mount an invasion of his
                            country, but he insists he needs high performance aircraft and adequate
                            naval boats to maintain his position, particularly in the Persian Gulf
                            area. He added that the United States can be assured he has no designs
                            on a single square inch of any other country's territory and that he is
                            interested only in preventing adventureism on the part of his neighbors,
                            particularly the Arab states. He pointed out that he must develop funds
                            to purchase military and developmental equipment from the United States,
                            this being only possible either through selling more oil via the
                            Consortium or by being successful in getting the United States to give
                            Iran an oil import quota. In exchange for such a quota, he is prepared
                            to assure the United States that he will spend every cent of the money
                            earned purchasing American equipment directly from the United States,
                            thus contributing to American balance of payments, perhaps to the extent
                            of $400,000,000 a year. (It was not clear to me how he arrived at this
                            figure and whether or not it was a one-time projection or a continuing
                            one.)</p>
                        <p>7. The Shah spent a few minutes discussing agricultural development in
                            his country. He described the system he has devised whereby the small
                            farmers are being encouraged to contribute their land to a larger
                            holding unit in exchange for shares in the earnings of this new entity.
                            These larger groupings in turn will permit the use of modern
                            agricultural machinery and the development of advance agricultural
                            methods. The Shah was obviously pleased with the way his new scheme is
                            working, and in answer to my question, he described how his personal
                            study of communal farming systems in countries like <pb n="3" xml:id="d31-03" facs="d31-03"/>Israel and the Soviet Union had led
                            him to propose a different, indigenous plan for Iran. He commented that
                            the Yugoslavs were ahead of the United States in their display of
                            interest in introducing modern agricultural methods to his country. In
                            this connection, he described what the Yugoslavs refer to as "vertical
                            agriculture”. At another point he said that John Deere and Company are
                            being encouraged to build a farm equipment factory in Iran.</p>
                        <p>8. Looking to the future, the Shah proposed that the United States
                            "augment" its intelligence collection activities in the Middle
                            East-Indian Ocean area. He underlined that Iran has no external
                            intelligence service which can do this job, pointing out that it takes a
                            long time to develop an adequate foreign intelligence system. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>9. The meeting was, as usual, frank and cordial. The undersigned has
                            never seen the Shah more self-assured or more confident. in the
                            prosperous future of his country.</p>

                        <p>The Shah opened the conversation by saying how pleased he was with the
                            talk he had with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            yesterday. He said the President has an excellent understanding of Iran,
                            its problems and its achievements. He said that he told the President of
                            his need to increase his oil income and he thought the President would
                            try to help him either with the Consortium or through the provision of a
                            special import quota for Iran to market oil in the United States. In
                            this connection he said that unlike other countries Iran would spend
                            every penny of money earned in this way in the United States. He
                            estimated that he could spend about $400-$500 million here annually for
                            military equipment and a variety of goods such as locomotives,
                            telecommunications and electronic equipment, and other capital
                            products.</p>

                        <p>Referring to Arab countries in the area, the Shah said that many of them
                            were now in the hands of unprincipled bandits who either for their own
                            purposes or in the misbegotten belief that Communism was a wave of the
                            future were disposed to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He saw the Soviets gaining domination of the area
                            through a pincer movement, one arm of which started in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and came up the Arabian Peninsula
                            through Yemen. The other arm extended down from Iraq aimed toward Kuwait
                            and Saudi Arabia. The Shah said that Kuwait was vulnerable as was Saudi
                            Arabia about which he was especially concerned. If events continued to
                            unfold in Arab countries as they have in the past he felt there was
                            great danger for Iran. He must, therefore, have the capability to defend
                            himself without outside assistance. Indeed, he said, he must have an
                            "over-kill" capability so that should anyone be tempted to attack Iran
                            they would think twice or even three times. The Secretary asked whether
                            Iran was not already much stronger than Iraq and would it not be madness
                            for Iraq to contemplate attacking Iran. The Shah answered that "those
                            fellows in Iraq are mad.” He said that Iraq had all but one division of
                            its troops on the Iraqi-Iranian border. Perhaps this was because of <pb n="2" xml:id="d33-02" facs="d33-02"/>their fear of Israel and, of
                            course, some of them were busy with the Kurds, but, he said, he really
                            didn't know if this was the full explanation of why they were there. The
                            Shah went on to describe the military assistance that the Soviets are
                            giving Iraq. He said this included missile launching vessels and pilot
                            training for large numbers of Iraqi air force personnel. The Secretary
                            suggested that the Soviets might counsel moderation to the Iraqis even
                            though they are supplying them with military equipment since the Soviets
                            also realize that Iraq would be no match for Iran. The Shah agreed that
                            the Soviets have a strong incentive in doing so, particularly in view of
                            their "understanding" with Iraq about oil developments in the Rumaila
                            field. With reference to Soviet arms policy the Shah noted that two
                            years ago the Soviets were urging on Iran all sorts of military
                            equipment. Lately, however, they seem to have withdrawn and he and his
                            Foreign Minister have asked the Soviets about a pending Iranian request
                            for military equipment and so far have received no reply. He did not
                            know what to make of this. (Iran reportedly asked the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for 400 23mm anti-aircraft guns in
                            early 1969.)</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Shah said that the security of the Persian Gulf area must be the
                            responsibility of its member countries. Ideally this could best be
                            provided for primarily through some arrangement between its two most
                            powerful members, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Since there were a number of
                            uncertainties about Saudi Arabia's future, however, including the
                            question of a successor to King Feisal, Iran cannot bank on this. It
                            must be prepared to stand by itself if necessary. The Shah said that his
                            first priority in providing for his defense is his air force. He will
                            need additional F-4's and a successor aircraft to replace his F-5's. He
                            said he intends to ask Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> about our intentions with respect to the Northrop
                            P-530 aircraft. If it appears that this plane will not be developed then
                            he is thinking in terms of replacing his F-5's with F-4EF's (a
                            stripped-down version of the F-4). He said he was much impressed with
                            the F-4EF which can do many of the same things that an F-4 can do but is
                            less expensive and has less sophisticated electronics. The acquisition
                            of additional aircraft will require additional pilot training. He hopes
                            that the US can provide 100 pilot training spaces in the future. He said
                            he also needs <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technicians to help
                            him maintain these planes and hopes that we can continue tb provide for
                            these.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d34-02" facs="d34-02"/>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that we have some problems with the size of our
                            military presence abroad and we are trying to reduce it where we can.
                            The Shah countered that the Soviet Union has at least 1,000 military
                            advisors in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> so we should not
                            feel inhibited in providing our good friend Iran with a considerably
                            smaller number. The Shah said that he hopes Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> can tell him whether we expect to
                            continue to purchase Sheridan tanks for our own military forces. If we
                            do not and the manufacture of Sheridans will be only for replacement
                            purposes the Shah said he would not be interested in acquiring any more
                            himself. As a substitute he intended to refurbish his present inventory
                            of M-47 tanks and outfit them with a 105 mm gun, a laser beam which
                            would permit them to operate under any condition of visibility and a
                            gyrostabilizer which would permit them to fire while underway. He
                            expressed hope that the US could help him with his tank rehabilitation
                            program. In addition he was much attracted to the idea of acquiring
                            armored helicopters which have substantial maneuverability advantages
                            over tanks. In this connection the Shah also mentioned that he has

                        <p>The Secretary expressed our hope that the Shah could do something to
                            bolster Saudi Arabia and Lebanon who are among the very few remaining
                            moderate Arab governments in the area. The Shah said he of course agreed
                            with the Secretary that something should be done about Saudi Arabia. He
                            said that in Rabat he had not had the opportunity of speaking to King
                            Feisal as extensively as he had hoped. He was concerned about the
                            arrests that had been made in Saudi Arabia recently — regarding them as
                            evidence of internal unrest. The Shah said that the Saudis needed to
                            embark on a really imaginative reform program. He hoped to speak to
                            Prince Fand, who is to visit him in Tehran in the near future, about
                            this. The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            told the Shah that he would have a receptive audience since they had
                            both found Prince Fahd very reform-minded. The Shah observed that really
                            meaningful reforms were difficult to implement under King Feisal because
                            he thought differently than he about these matters. He said that King
                            Feisal believed in the strict letter of the Koran which he, the Shah,
                            even though he was a good Moslem, found inadequate to modern day needs.
                            He lamented the absence of a clear arrangement for succession should
                            anything happen to King Feisal. He said the Crown Prince was a weak,
                            ineffectual nonentity.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d35-02" facs="d35-02"/>
                        <p>With reference to Lebanon the Shah expressed contempt for its present
                            leaders characterizing them as untrustworthy liars. He said, however,
                            that to the extent that Iran had any influence with the people of
                            Lebanon he would attempt to exercise it in persuading them to counsel
                            the Fedayeen to be more moderate with regard to its neighbors and to do
                            anything else he could to help the people of Lebanon maintain their
                            integrity.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of other personalities in the area, the Shah said that he was
                            much concerned about King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. He had had reports from his ambassador in Amman
                            that <persName>Hussein</persName> felt that he was becoming increasingly
                            isolated not only from his neighbors but from his own people. He said
                            that <persName>Hussein</persName> had recently talked to his military
                            telling them that they were the only ones he could rely on anymore. He
                            said King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> was a good,
                            brave man but he was evidently thoroughly disheartened and he did not
                            know what Hussein would do in the future.</p>

                            Majesty</p>
                        <p>His Imperial Majesty (<gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>) opened the
                            conversation by noting that the President of the United States
                            understands the Iranian position. Iran does not want anything from
                            others in the way of territory. But at the same time, Iran cannot allow
                            others to take away Iran's national heritage. Increasingly, Iran must
                            take more responsibility for the region in which it finds itself. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> commented on the resignation of Prime
                            Minister Karame in Lebanon after the Lebanese Government moved to crack
                            down on the fedayeen. Syria is massing troops on the Lebanese border.
                            Iraq is a madhouse. The Russians are taking more and more interest in
                            Iraq, and the Soviet Embassy is spying for Iraq in Tehran. All of this
                            prompts Iran to be more vigilant <pb n="2" xml:id="d36-02" facs="d36-02"/>than ever before. Iran's first priority is the air force. Its second
                            priority is an adequate naval force. And it's third priority is a
                            relatively small but effective land force. Regarding these priorities,
                            Iran has carefully studied its needs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. The Iranian Air Force.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> Informed the Secretary that Iran
                            would need more F-4 aircraft in 1973 and thereafter (four more
                            squadrons, to be precise). In addition, by 1975, Iran planned to replace
                            its F-5 aircraft. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> inquired as to the
                            status of the Northrop P-530. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> also
                            suggested the possibility of Iran buying a modified version of the F-4:
                            the F-4EF. Iran will also be purchasimg C-130 aircraft. then raised the
                            question of pilot and mechanic training. Iran will insist on 100
                            training spaces for pilots in the future in the United States, but may
                            have to search for vacancies elsewhere if these additional training
                            spaces are not available. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> also
                            expressed preference for blue suit (<gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>) personnel assistance in the training of Iron's jet
                            aircraft mechanics. Iran could hire commercially in the United States,
                            but both for reasons of competency and cost, Iran would prefer <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel. The Secretary inquired
                            further into the question of why Iran likes blue suiters. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> agreed that another reason for liking
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> perconnel would be that they
                            are better disciplined, but there have been problems when requests were
                            made by the Iranian Government for moving these personnel, and these
                            requests [garbled] were refused. The Secretary mentioned the example of
                            the South Korean Air Force and its good performance on aircraft
                            maintenance. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> emphasized the problem
                            of obtaining higher enlisted grade of Iranian maintenance personnel
                            since some time is needed for experience and promotion. He also pointed
                            out that the Iranian use of <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            personnel was originally on the advice of the U.S. Government. He also
                            commented about his disscussions with the President concerning more
                            revenue for Iran through oil and other sources. The Secretary noted that
                            Northrop has yet to find two countries interested in their P-530. He
                            thought there would be a better chance with the F-5-21. He proceeded to
                            explain the conflict between committees of Congress on the F-5-21, with
                            Senator Fulbright opposed to the development of aircraft desigined
                            chiefly for foreign countries, and the House Armed Services Comittee
                            differing from Senator Fulbright's position. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> insisted that the Iranian Government was much more
                            interested in the P-530 although a few F-5-21s might be purchased to
                            supplement the F-5s. Surely, there would be no F-5-21 purchase after
                            1975. The Secretary inquired ad to whether <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> had seen the computer-gaming of various American
                            aircraft versus the Soviet MIG-21. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>
                            asked why the United States Government did not develop the P-530 for its
                            own use. The Secretary replied that the F-15 is the aircraft which the
                            Air Force will use in its next major fighter development. The Air Force
                            is interested in going beyond the P-530 and its technology. Concept
                            papers are now being developed, with three <pb n="3" xml:id="d36-03" facs="d36-03"/>daircraft firms involved, and attempts are being made
                            to cut costs back from the present $9 million per copy figure. The
                            Secretary also thought their pricing on the P-530 Is too low, and
                            promised cooperative figures on the P-530, F-5-21, and F-4EF. These
                            figures will soon be available. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> also
                            noted that orders will have to be placed now on additional F-4 aircraft.
                            The Secretary then turned to the question of the pilot trainig problems
                            of Iran. He noted that there are now 156 pilot training slots available
                            for foreign pilots, of which the Iranian government has 75. The Defense
                            Department will be glad to look into the problem of raising the 75 to
                            100. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> replied that in view of the
                            special relationship between the U. S. government and the Iranian
                            Government, Iran would expect this expansion. The original Iran order
                            for C-130s has been cut back so there will be a slight decrease in the
                            number of additional pilot spaces Iran had requested earlier. The
                            Secretary replied that the Defense Department will study this matter and
                            is very interested in the Joint study being, prepared in Iran by U. S.
                            and Iranian military officials on the future needs of the Iranian Air
                            Force. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> again said that Iran is
                            insistimg on more vacancies; also that Iran will insist on blue suit
                            maintenance assistance. In closing his discussion of air force needs,
                                <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> commended the work of General
                            Twitchell, but wondered if, in future appointments of the Chief
                                ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to Iran, a rotation
                            among the services could not be instituted as a departure from the
                            tradition of always appointing a U.S. Army general.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Sheridan/Shillelagh Tanks</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> asked whether the U. S. Government
                            plans on moving forward with the Sheridan/Shillelagh, in which case Iran
                            will do the same. But if the U.S. Government does not have such plans,
                            then Iran would drop its order for these tanks and proceed with
                            retrofitting its M-47 tanks, eventually to the point of putting the
                            Shillelagh missile system on the M-47. Then it would replace its armored
                            squad cars with helicopters. The Secretary replied that it is not
                            possible for the Defense Department to make a decision about moving
                            forward on the Sheridan/Shillelagh system in the near future, and surely
                            not by 31 October or early November, which is the date by which GMC
                            would like a response from Iran. The U.S. Government cannot guarantee at
                            this time that it will move further on the system. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> then noted that perhaps it would be
                            better for Iran to drop the Sheridan/Shillelagh, train its personnel on
                            the present Shillelaghs it has, and then wait for the Shillelagh system
                            to be developed on American main batt1e-tanks. Iran will also have to
                            talk with BMY Corporation on the M-47 retrofit and eventually even
                            produce the entire M-47 tank itself. But first priority will be a
                            facility to overhaul completely Iran's present tank force and even to
                            provide overhaul facilities for other countries. In this regard, <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>nquired into the operating life of the
                            M-47 tank engine. The Secretary promised to deliver the information
                            about the life expectancy of M-47 tank engines to Blair house this same
                            afternoon. Cooperation was promised by the Secretary regarding the tank
                            overhaul facility.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Matters and Conclusion</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the Department of Defense has money problems
                            on Capitol Hill regarding foreign military assistance and credit.
                            Frustrations over war in Southeast Asia will focus on the Department of
                            Defense for the next year or two. As the Secretary sees matters between
                            U.S. Government and Iran on military problems, there are two immediate
                            issues which must be settled: (a) technical assistance and the mix of
                            blue suiters-contract personnel for this assistance; (b) pilot training
                            billets. There is a pinch on trained personnel due to Vietnam but,
                            hopefully, this pinch will be over before long. This situation has
                            forced the U.S. Government to enter into expensive commercial contracts,
                            for its own maintenance, in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>.
                                <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> suggested that Iran could hire
                            Phillipine personnel for maintaining F-5s, and perhaps McDonnel Douglas
                            and others for F-4 maintenance, but expressed again Iran's strong
                            preference for American military personnel for maintenance. The
                            Secretary again hoped that comparative data on the P-530s, F-5-21s, and
                            F-4EFs would be made available in the next few weeks. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> wished also to add a few miscellaneous
                            items to the discussion: (a) Iran's need for longer range artillery; and
                            (b) replacement of Iran's anti-tank bazookas with TOW missiles. Iran
                            will have to decide between the TOW and a German bazooka. The Secretary
                            noted that within this year. the U.S. Government will have two sources
                            for producing the TOW. HIM observed that with the abandoning of the
                            Sheridan/Shillelaghs, Iran would have considerable more room for credit.
                            He also inquired as to whether it would be possible to send technical
                            kits on the stretching of the 155 mm. SP to 18 km. The Secretary again
                            stated that the U.S. Government has not made its final decision on the
                            future of the Sheridan/Shillelagh and therefore it would misleading to
                            encourage the Iranians to purchase it at this time. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> expressed his thanks to the Secretary
                            for the meeting.</p>

                                briefly <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. No other
                                record of the farewell talk was found. (Ibid., White House Central
                                Files) In Telegram 203729 to Tehran, December 8, the Department
                                requested background information in order to devise a proper
                                approach on Iranian opium production. (Ibid., RG 59, Central Files
                                1967-69, SOC 11-5 IRAN.) In Airgram A-5 to the Department, January
                                7, 1970, the Embassy reported that the Iranian Council of Ministers
                                had allocated 6200 hectares for poppy planting. (Ibid., INCO DRUGS
                                IRAN.) In telegram 211 from Geneva, January 20, 1970, the U.S.

                        <p>In addition to other loose ends you may wish to tie up during the Shah's
                            farewell call, there is one item I have not previously mentioned which
                            might warrant a word.</p>
                        <p>I am now in the process of staffing out a broad recommendation from John
                            Mitchell and <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> on
                            an international effort to bring heroin traffic under control. One of
                            their lesser suggestions is that you say a word to the Shah about this,
                            and I think that makes sense.</p>
                        <p>The problem is that Iran after a ten-year hiatus has this year resumed
                            production of the opium poppy, the product of which can be converted
                            into morphine base and then into heroin. We urged Iran not to do this,
                            but the Iranians say it can stop only if Turkey and Afghanistan stop. We
                            are already working with Turkey, but Afghanistan is still a problem.</p>
                        <p>The points you might make are simply that:</p>
                        <p>—Heroin is a major problem for some of our citizens. Some three tons a

                        <p>—You are trying hard to bring this under control.</p>
                        <p>—You hope the Shah will lend his support to our efforts internationally
                            to curb sources of supply. You will raise this with Turkish Prime
                            Minister Demirel.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I do not recommend that you read all of the attached paper, though you
                            may want to look at sections I and IV which summarize the argument and
                            conclusions. The paper was done as an internal staff paper here for our
                            man working with the Cabinet Task Force on oil import policy, so the
                            rest of it covers some basic political ground in an overly simple
                            way.</p>
                        <p>There are two points here, however, which may warrant your attention:</p>
                        <p>1. The immediate operational problem is how to handle the Iranian oil
                            import requests. You mentioned to me yesterday that the Shah obviously
                            expects something. My purpose in this memo is to construct an option in
                            the context of the oil import policy review that would include a quota
                            for Iran. The oil experts will probably pick it to pieces. But I just
                            felt that no one would even look at the Iranian case if we on the
                            political side didn't press it. So for the tactical purpose of gaining a
                            hearing for the argument, I have—at the risk of being brushed aside by
                            the experts as naive—made myself an advocate for a general policy that
                            would justify country quotas for a few selected friends like Iran,
                            Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and possibly Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>2. The longer range point is how this relates to developing a foundation
                            for the US presence in the Mid-East in the 1970's. Obviously we may not
                            have much future there if the Arab-Israeli impasse continues. But
                            planning around that for the moment, I see a fundamental problem:</p>
                        <p> US programs as presently constituted—economic aid, military aid,
                            cultural exchange—just aren't going to be available in the Mid-East
                            because most of the countries there will have enough income of their own
                            from oil or will get help from oil-rich neighbors. We will have to build
                            our presence on different foundations.</p>
                        <p>One of these, I hope, will be the activities of US private industry and
                            investment, especially in oil and oil-related fields. Another will be in
                            education and technical assistance, though we now have almost no base in
                            current programs for a significant effort in this area for <pb n="2" xml:id="d38-02" facs="d38-02"/>countries with their own resources. A
                            third will have to be in the more sophisticated area of trade. In short,
                            as we try to relate to these maturing economies, we will have to pay
                            more attention to trade and investment policy.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian argument is a clear case in point, and it seems to me that
                            you and I, looking to the future, have a reason to fight for a policy
                            something like that outlined in the attached. I am the first to admit
                            that I am launching into a technical area beyond my competence. But I'm
                            doing so purposely to draw attention to a problem.</p>
                        <p>I'm sending copies of this to <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Stuart</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJC3">Jack</persName>
                            because of the Iranian angle which they might want to think about
                            pursuing in some form, but I did want to put my more general proposition
                            to you. The ideas are all uncopyrighted, but I guess for the moment I
                            shouldn't be identified with the attached outside the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> family.</p>

                        <p>You will recall meeting Ambassador Afshar during the Shah's visit. A
                            biographic sketch is attached.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has asked to see you to deliver a message from the Shah.
                            We have no idea what this may be about, but it is characteristic of the
                            Shah to follow up his meetings with our President by reporting any
                            backsliding that he may see on what he regards as the President's
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>In this case, you can well imagine that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and the State Department
                            are taking a more cautious line on the oil import policy questions
                            because they are not aware of exactly how forthcoming the President
                            was.</p>
                        <p>Two things have been done since the Shah's visit:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Peter Flanigan</persName> agreed to talk
                            with the Chairman of the Board at Esso to see whether any of the
                            consortium members would be able to increase their offtake from
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>2. He and I met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> to tell him what the President had said to the
                            Shah so that he could take account of it in his oil import policy
                            review. Through Fred Bergsten I have submitted a general paper for the
                            Cabinet Task Force Staff providing a possible policy rationale for an
                            import quota for Iran and a couple of other free countries. This, of
                            course, was done without any reference to the President's talk with the
                            Shah and is designed simply to create an option for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> to deal with against the
                            background of his special knowledge of the President's promise.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points:</p>
                        <p>1. You are delighted that the Shah's visit was such a success.</p>
                        <p>2. You understand the Ambassador has a message which he would like to
                            deliver.</p>
                        <p>3. If the message deals with oil import questions, you hope that the
                            Ambassador and His Majesty will understand that we have to work our way
                            through some very elaborate governmental machinery before we can make
                            any commitments. This process is underway and you have made every effort
                            to assure that the President's warm feeling for Iran is being taken
                            account of.</p>

                        <p>1. During Shah's Washington visit October 21-23, 1969, he asked for
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> response on several military
                            subjects. We are not yet in position to give definitive reply, but
                            status report along following lines given verbally to Iranian Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> Nov. 21.</p>
                        <p>2. Additional Pilot Training: The <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            Jet Undergraduate Pilot Training Program (UPT) is operating at maximum
                            capacity and we note <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has been unable
                            so far this year to fill 10 beginning training spaces because candidates
                            lack adequate English proficiency. In view fact present program appears
                            adequate for Iran for time being and unlikelihood of additional spaces
                            being available for Iran at present, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            wishes defer decision re additional UPT spaces for Iran. Hope to be able
                            to provide additional spaces in future, however, if demands from Vietnam
                            moderated. FYI Before making decision we would hope to have <pb n="2" xml:id="d40-02" facs="d40-02"/>clear picture of future <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> force plan and some assurance
                            adequate number of fully qualified trainees will be forthcoming. End
                            FYI.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> Technicians: Secretary of
                            Defense has authorized continuation of 54-man mission for another year
                            and has directed <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> to study
                            feasibility of increasing number to 75. No further decision will be made
                            until <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> Deputy Assistant Secretary
                            Pranger returns to Washington.</p>
                        <p>4. Comparison of P-530, F-5-21, and F-4EF: Since none of these aircraft
                            have been produced and range from a conception to increasing or
                            decreasing capabilities of existing aircraft, no firm cost or proven
                            operational data is available and sound comparisons cannot be made until
                            next spring at the earliest. However, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> will provide Embassy with commercial prospectus
                            information currently available on P-530, F-5-21, and F-4EF in a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will be interested to learn that
                            Congress has approved (but not yet appropriated) $28 million for
                            development of a Free World Fighter to be relatively inexpensive and at
                            least equal to MIG-21. When technical and operational requirements
                            defined, an aircraft will be selected on competitive basis. F-5-21,
                            F-4EF and LOCKHEED CL-1195-1 <pb n="3" xml:id="d40-03" facs="d40-03"/>have been proposed; P-530 and others may be considered.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> also called on Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Trezise</persName> Nov. 24 and
                            asked about the Shah's oil import proposal. We informed him oil import
                            program still under review and may not be completed until mid-December.
                            We noted, however, task force unlikely to recommend special country
                            quotas. FYI Task force report is unlikely to include any special
                            provision for Iran. End FYI.</p>

                        <p>1. WHEN I CALLED ON SHAH LAST EVENING TO DISCUSS <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> RESPONSE TO IRAN'S MILITARY REQUEST (STATE 197323), HE
                            IMMEDIATELY OPENED CONVERSATION BY ASKING WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING I
                            COULD TELL HIM RE IRAN OlL EXPORTS TO US. HE SAID HE HAD JUST RECEIVED
                            TELEGRAM FROM IRAN EMBASSY WASHINGTON THAT SCHULTZ COMMITTEE WAS
                            STUDYING TWO POSSIBILITIES: (A) INCREASE OF RATIO OF OIL IMPORTS TO US
                            DOMESTIC PRODUCTION FROM 12.2 PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT (B) DOING AWAY WITH
                            IMPORT QUOTA AND REPLACING IT WITH IMPORT TAX OF 90 TO 95 CENTS PER
                            BARREL. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT EITHER OF THESE COURSES WOULD RESULT IN SOME
                            INCREASE IN OIL IMPORTS INTO US BUT WOULD NOT BENEFIT IRAN IN ANY
                            SPECIAL WAY AND MIGHT EVEN BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO IRAN SINCE OIL
                            COMPANIES MIGHT BE DISPOSED TO ALLOCATE OIL TO LIBYA AND OTHER
                            NON-PERSIAN GULF SOURCES. THIS, HE FELT, WOULD BE MOST INADEQUATE FOR
                            IRAN IN VIEW IRAN'S STAUNCH SOLIDARITY WITH US AND WEST AND ITS UNIQUE
                            OFFER TO SPEND 100 PERCENT OF OIL IMPORT REVENUES IN US IF IRAN WERE
                            ALLOCATED OR RECEIVED SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. SURELY HE SAID, THIS OFFER
                            WHICH WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS COUPLED WITH IRAN'S
                            NEED FOR INCREASED OIL REVENUES TO EFFECTIVELY EXERCISE ITS STABILIZING
                            INFLUENCE IN GULF AREA WARANTED SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. HE ADDED WITH
                            SARDONIC SMILE THAT SUBSTANTIAL PART OF MONEY US OILS COMPAINES PAID FOR
                            KUWAIT, SAUDI AND LIBYAN OIL WENT TO EGYPT TO FINANCE <pb n="2" xml:id="d41-02" facs="d41-02"/> NASSER'S CAMPAIGN Of VILIFICATION OF
                            THE US. IN A SENSE THIS REMINDED HIM OF POLICY OF AMERICAN COMMERCIAL
                            INTEREST BEFORE PEARL HARBOR WHEN THEY EXPORTED TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF
                            SCRAP IRON TO JAPAN ONLY TO HAVE IT RETURNED IN FINISHED FORM AT PEARL
                            HARBOR AND FOR FOUR LONG YEARS IN THE PACIFIC.</p>
                        <p>2. HE SAID HE WAS STILL HUNTING ON SOME SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT FOR IRAN IN
                            LIGHT OF "PRESIDENT NIXON'S DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN'S NEED FOR
                            ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUES" TO EXERCISE STABLIZING INFLUENCE IN GULF AND
                            MIDDLE EAST AND SINCE DURING HIS RECENT WASHINGTON VISIT PRESIDENT HAD
                            IN HIS PRESENCE INSTRUCTED ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS, FLANAGAN HE THOUGHT IT
                            WAS, TO TELL US OIL COMPANIES IT WAS IN US NATIONAL INTEREST TO PURCHASE
                            MORE IRANIAN OIL AND ALSO TO MAKE THIS POINT TO US MEMBERS OF OIL
                            CONSORTIUM.</p>
                        <p>3. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING HE FULLY UNDERSTOOD PRESIDENT WAS NOT IN A
                            POSITION TO GIVE HIM ANY WORD UNTIL HE HAD RECEIVED AND STUDIED THE
                            SCHULTZ COMMITTEE REPORT BUT HE DID WISH THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW THAT HE
                            WAS COUNTING ON HIS WARM FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING TO FIND SOME MEANS
                            OF HELPING TO MEET IRAN'S PROBLEM.</p>

                            FEELING, AFTER OUR DISCUSSION OF IRAN'S MILITARY REQUESTS, THAT IN PAST
                            WE HAD SOMETIMES SHOWN A DISPOSITION TO TELL HIM THAT IRAN DID NOT NEED
                            THIS OR THAT FOR ITS OWN DEFENSE. IRAN WAS LOCATED IN A MOST UNSTABLE
                            PART OF THE WORLD, AND HAD NEIGHBORS WHO WERE TRYING TO TOPPLE MODERATE
                            REGIMES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOME RADICAL REGIMES EVEN HAD TERRITORIAL
                            AMBITIONS. IF THE US WERE WILLING TO GIVE AN IRON-CLAD GUARANTEE TO COME
                            TO IRAN'S ASSISTANCE, WE MIGHT HAVE RIGHT TO EXPRESS VIEW THAT IRAN DID
                            NOT NEED THIS OR THAT. HOWEVER, WERE NOT IN SUCH A POSITION AND INDEED
                            DOUBTED IT WOULD BE WISE TO HAVE SUCH A GUARANTEE EVEN IF WE COULD GIVE
                            IT SINCE HE THOUGHT TIME HAD PASSED WHEN GREAT POWERS COULD INTERVENE IN
                            ME AND ASIA. IN LIGHT OF THIS HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE IRAN MUST
                            DECIDE WHAT ITS OWN DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS ARE SINCE ITS SECURITY AND
                            INDEPENDENCE ARE AT STAKE.</p>
                        <p>2. HE SAID IRAN HAD NO TERRITORIAL OR OTHER AMBITIONS AGAINST ITS
                            NEIGHBORS AND WHILE HE DID NOT THINK SOVIETS WOULD USE OVERT MILITARY
                            FORCE AGAINST IRAN, SOVIETS HAVE NEVER RENOUNCED THEIR GOAL TO SEE
                            COMMUNISM TRIUMPH IN THE WORLD. FURTHERFORE, THEIR NAVAL VISITS AND
                            ACTIVITIES IN PERSIAN GULF AREA AND THEIR MILITARY STRENGTHENING OF THE
                            RADICAL ARAB REGIMES IN IRAQ, SYRIA AND EGYPT WAS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF
                            SOVIET SUPPORT OF EFFORTS OF THESE RADICAL REGIMES TO TOPPLE MORE
                            MODERATE REGIMES OF THEIR NEIGHBORS. HE HOPED AND PRAYED THAT SAUDI AND
                            KUWATI REGIMES WOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND <pb n="2" xml:id="d42-02" facs="d42-02"/>PRESSURE FROM RADICALS BUT IN ANY EVENT IRAN MUST BE
                            PREPARED TO STAND ALONE IF NECESSARY IN DEFENDING ITSELF. FURTHERMORE,
                            IF IRAN WERE STRONG THE RADICAL ARAB STATES WOULD BE LESS TEMPTED TO
                            UNDERTAKE ACTIONS WHICH COULD LEAD TO HOSTILITIES.</p>

                            the Shah and other <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> officials have
                            high hopes that a way will be found to permit Iran to increase its oil
                            exports to the United States and that they are counting heavily on
                            alleged Presidential assurances to the Shah, given during his October
                            state visit. While the work of the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import
                            Control is not yet completed we understand that its thinking is
                            crystallizing around recommendations which would not materially enhance
                            Iran's chances of increasing its oil exports to the United States.
                            Predictably the Shah will be sharply disappointed if these
                            recommendations become U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>As there is no written record of the President's conversation with the
                            Shah we find it difficult to assess the Shah's present expections. We

                        <p>You will recall that the President asked me, in the presence of the Shah
                            of Iran, to make every effort to assist in closing the gap between the
                            Iranian Government's requirements for the sale of oil to finance its
                            Development Program and the current 1970 projections of such sales. Set
                            forth below are three possible actions to achieve the desired result,
                            and a status report on each:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Consortium</p>
                        <p>The bulk of the oil lifted from Iran is taken by a consortium made up of
                            40% British Petroleum, 14% English Shell, 7% each for Texaco, Standard
                            of California, Standard of N.J., Mobil and Gulf, 5% a group of U.S.
                            Independents, and 6% <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss>. With Deputy
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SND1">Samuels</persName> I have
                            personally met with Messers. Jamison and Collado of Jersey, Miller of
                            California, Tavaleres and Moses of Mobil and Brockett of Gulf, and I
                            have telephoned Rambin of Texaco. To each of these people I have
                            indicated the President's desire, on the basis of the national security
                            interest, that the consortium go a long way toward meeting the $155
                            million gap between its projected Iranian oil take in 1970 and the
                            projected governmental requirements. No specific program was urged on
                            the companies. It was recognized that the U.S. interests would not be
                            served by an action detrimental to Saudia Arabia, and it was further
                            recognized that Iran had fared well in recent years compared with the
                            other Persian gulf countries. While the oil companies insisted that the
                            Shah's demands were "insatiable,” they recognized that both national
                            security interests and social justice support doing just as much as
                            possible for Iran.</p>
                        <p>The English oil companies have been more enthusiastic about larger oil
                            liftings from Iran than have the American companies. <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> has attempted to bring the German oil
                            company into the consortium. <pb n="2" xml:id="d44-02" facs="d44-02"/>The members of the consortium will meet in New York during the week of
                            January 12. The American companies have agreed to discuss the
                            possibility of increasing Iranian liftings during this meeting. The
                            English companies have a large position in the rapidly growing oil
                            production from the Trucial States. It was generally agreed that
                            increases in oil liftings from these areas might well be limited in
                            order to take further oil from Iran. I indicated to the U.S. oil
                            companies that if they felt it necessary, for the purpose of these
                            discussions, to receive Justice Department approval to talk about the
                            problem, I would approach the Justice Department on their behalf. A
                            report should be forthcoming by January 19th as to the results of the
                            meeting of the consortium in New York.</p>
                        <p>The dominant member of the consortium is British Petroleum which has 40%
                            of the consortium and a 50% economic interest in the oil currently being
                            lifted. A large stockholder in <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> is the
                            British government. It may be that <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>
                            will need urging to help find a satisfactory solution for Iran. Since
                            part of the problem of Iran arises from the British withdrawal from the
                            Persian Gulf, such governmental urgings might be an appropriate subject
                            for discussion between the President and Prime Minister Wilson during
                            the latter's visit at the end of January. This can better be determined
                            after the report of the New York meeting.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Iranian Governmental Sales</p>
                        <p>The government of Iran has incorporated the National Iranian Oil Company
                            (NIOC) to sell in the international oil market additional Iranian oil
                            production. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName>, the Vice
                            Chairman of NIOC and its managing director, met with me and <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Harold</persName> Saunders of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on January 8. Mr. Brownell participated
                            in these meetings. We discussed the status of the Planet Oil proposals.
                            I informed Mr. Brownell that no action would be forthcoming in the near
                            future on these proposals.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName> with regard to
                            the 1970 budget of Iran, no help could be expected as a result of the
                            Cabinet Committee on Oil Imports. I did tell him, however, that we were
                            attempting to find ways to ease his problem but that no assurance of any
                            satisfactory results could be given.</p>
                        <p>After Brownell and the others had left, <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName> informed me that in the past Norwegians have been
                            transporting 5 to 8 million tons (100,000 barrels per day) of oil from
                            the Soviet Union to Cuba. Apparently some portion of this is used in
                            Cuba and the balance is sold throughout the Caribbean. This is part of
                            the barter deal between Cuba and Russia for Cuban sugar. Russia is
                            apparently short of oil and has directed the Norwegians to buy oil in
                            the Middle East to meet this commitment. The Norwegians have approached
                            the Iranians, making it clear that if the Iranians refuse to make this
                            sale they will buy the oil from Iraq's excess production. <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName> asked what the position of the
                            U.S. government would be on such a sale, indicating that he would abide
                            by any direction given <pb n="3" xml:id="d44-03" facs="d44-03"/>by the
                            U.S. Government. He did point out, however, that should Iran make the
                            sale the proceeds would be spent by it in the United States, while if
                            Iraq made the sale the proceeds would be spent in Russia. The sale would
                            be made by Iran to Norway, with no explicit information from the
                            Norwegian purchaser as to the destination of the oil. I told <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName> that I would tell him whether
                            this government would resist such a sale by Iran to Norway or would take
                            no position with regard to it.</p>
                        <p>3. The Defense Department meets its requirements for petroleum products
                            through purchases from <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">ARAMCO</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">ARAMCO</gloss> is owned entirely by 4 American
                            oil companies, with the oil being produced in Saudi Arabia. It is
                            possible that the Defense Department could be directed to purchase a
                            portion of its requirements from Iran. This, however, would have two
                            negative factors.</p>
                        <p>1. A substantial portion of the profits from these purchases would go to
                            non-American companies if Iranian oil were sought.</p>
                        <p>2. If the consortium were asked to make sales to the Defense Department,
                            it would simply reallocate its distribution pattern without increasing
                            the oil liftings from the various areas. I would suggest this be the
                            last consideration on the list after exhausting the possibilities with
                            the consortium and the sale to the Norwegians.</p>
                        <p>I will keep you fully appraised of the situation with the consortium.
                            Would you please tell me at your earliest convenience a reply that
                            should be given to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FR1">Fallah</persName>
                            regarding the sale of oil to the Norwegians. If you reach different
                            conclusions with regard to the offshore purchases by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, I would appreciate your letting me
                            have them.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION:</p>
                        <p>During his visit to Washington last October the Shah asked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> for a continuation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technical assistance field
                            team in Iran to assist in training Iranian Air Force personnel in the
                            maintenance of F-4 aircraft Iran is obtaining from us. On October 25,
                            1969 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> authorized
                            the continuation of a 54-man team for one more year (February
                            1970-February 1971) and asked that the possibility of raising this
                            number to 75 be explored. The Shah was told of this decision by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> in
                            November. When <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> moved to implement
                            this decision, however, it found that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s decision was on the same basis
                            as the current program, i.e., unaccompanied tours. Most available
                            personnel are Vietnam veterans who are unwilling to volunteer for
                            another unaccompanied tour. The question arose, therefore whether
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> would be willing
                            to authorize new personnel sent to Iran under this program to be
                            accompanied by their family with a consequent increase in the size of
                            the Department of Defense community in Iran at a time when cuts are
                            being made elsewhere. Subordinate elements of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> have been grappling with this issue without definitive
                            results ever since.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has now
                            expressed his concern over the absence of a favorable decision (Tab B)
                            pointing out that if personnel now on hand are withdrawn as scheduled
                            within the next few weeks without replacements being supplied, F-4
                            training and readiness will suffer seriously. He urges a favorable
                            decision at the earliest possible date. We are informed that this
                            decision can be made only at the Secretary level.</p>

                        <p>Dear Dave:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> in Iran has
                            just drawn our attention to the delay being encountered in the
                            continuation of the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technical
                            assistance field team which is training Iranian technicians in the
                            maintenance of F-4 aircraft Iran is obtaining from us. He has pointed
                            out that if <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel presently in
                            Iran are withdrawn in the next few weeks as scheduled and replacements
                            are not provided, Iran's F-4 training and readiness status could be
                            seriously affected. The F-4 element of the Iranian Air Force is the
                            backbone of Iran's defense.</p>
                        <p>You may recall that during the Shah's visit to Washington in October 1969
                            he discussed this subject with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>.
                            On October 25 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                            approved the continuation of a 54-man <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> team for one more year and the Shah was so informed
                            subsequently. I understand that implementation of this decision has been
                            delayed over the question of whether replacement personnel will be
                            permitted to have their families with them. I believe that the effects
                            of our failure to provide <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            technicians in accordance with the Shah's expectations greatly outweigh
                            the disadvantages of increasing somewhat our official presence in Iran
                            by authorizing accompanied tours. This would be at no cost to the United
                            States Government since the Government of Iran pays all expenses
                            associated with this program. I hope, therefore, that resolution of this
                            question can be made quickly and the requisite personnel sent without
                            undue delay.</p>

                            FROM SHAH. HE SAID TELEGRAM INSTRUCTED HIM TO REMIND ME:</p>
                        <p>(A) OF GREAT URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE SHAH ATTACHED TO MATTERS,
                            PARTICULARLY OIL, WHICH HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT LAST
                            OCTOBER;</p>
                        <p>(B) OF SHAH'S EXPECTATION BASED ON HIS TALKS WITH PRESIDENT THAT US WOULD
                            BE FORTHCOMING IN RESPONDING TO IRAN'S REQUEST RE OIL AND ALSO MILITARY
                            MATTERS ON WHICH PEACE AND VERY FUTURE OF PERSIAN GULF DEPENDED;</p>
                        <p>(C) THAT THUS FAR THERE NO <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NO
                            FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO THESE REQUESTS; (HE SAID SHAH SENT PRESIDENT
                            PERSONAL MESSAGE THROUGH IRANIAN CHANNELS TO WHICH ONLY INTERIM REPLY
                            RECEIVED).</p>
                        <p>(D) TELEGRAM CONCLUDED BY ASKING WHAT THEN HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY
                            SHAH'S TALKS IN WASHINGTON.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> COMMENTED VERY
                            PRIVATELY TO ME THAT SHAH IS DEEPLAY DISTURBED BECAUSE THIS WHOLE POLICY
                            IS BASED ON CLOSE COOPERATION WITH US. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> HAS SEEN MEMCON OF <pb n="2" xml:id="d46-02" facs="d46-02"/>SHAH'S TALK WITH PRESIDENT FROM WHICH IT CLEAR SHAH
                            EXPECTED US WOULD HELP HIM ON MAJOR PROBLEMS ON WHICH SHAH CONVINCED
                            IRAN'S FUTURE STABILITY, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AND SECURITY
                            DEPENDED. MEMCON MENTIONED THAT IN SHAH'S PRESENCE THE PRESIDENT HAD
                            INSTRUCTED PETER FLANAGAN TO TELL US OIL COMPANIES THAT IT WAS IN US
                            NATIONAL INTEREST FOR THEM TO TAKE MORE IRANIAN OIL. IN LIGHT OF GRAVITY
                            OF IRAN'S FINANICIAL PROBLEMS, SOLUTIONS TO WHICH DEPEND PRIMARILY ON
                            MORE OIL REVENUE, SHAH OBVIOUSLY FEELING SENSE OF DEEP FRUSTRATION.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> BELIEVES THIS SENSE
                            OF FRUSTRATION MAY HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY OUR INSISTENCE THIS YEAR THAT
                            MSC CREDIT SHOULD BE 50/50 MSC-PRIVATE CREDIT INSTEAD OF 75 PERCENT MSC
                            AND 25 PERCENT PRIVATE CREDIT AS LAST YEAR; INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES;
                            OUR INABILITY TO MEET REQUEST RE AERIAL TANKERS (TEHRAN 536); NO
                            SPECIFIC REPLY FROM US RE "BLUE SUITERS,” ETC.</p>
                        <p>3. I SAID IT WAS NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT SURPRISING
                            THAT PRESIDENT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REPLY RE OIL SINCE HE HAD ONLY
                            RECEIVED SCHULTZ COMMITTEE REPORT FEW DAYS AGO AND MATTER OF OUR OIL
                            POLICY WAS ONE OF TREMENDOUS COMPLEXITY INSOFAR AS US DOMESTIC
                            CONSIDERATIONS ARE CONCERNED. HOWEVER, I KNEW THAT PRESIDENT AND
                            ADMINISTRATION WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO IRAN'S OIL PROBLEM AND WOULD
                            HAVE IT VERY MUCH IN MIND IN REACHING DECISION ALTHOUGH AT THIS JUNCTURE
                            IT JUST NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS. RE AERIAL TANKERS, THEY
                            SIMPLY WERE NOT AVAILABLE AS THEY WERE IN SHORT SUPPLY SUPPORTING COMBAT
                            OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM WHERE AMERICAN SOLDIERS ARE STILL DYING. IT IS
                            SIMPLY A QUESTION OF NON-AVAILABILITY AND NOT QUESTION OF OUR GOOD WILL
                            OR DESIRE TO HELP.</p>
                        <p>4. RE OIL <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> SAID SHAH STILL
                            EARNESTLY HOPING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD INCREASE
                            IRAN'S ACCESS TO AMERICAN MARKET THROUGH SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS OR
                            OTHERWISE AND THAT AT SAME TIME HE HOPES WHITE HOUSE WILL CONTINUE TO
                            URGE AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES, WITH WHOM <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WILL SOON BE MEETING IN ANNUAL REUNION WITH CONSORTIUM,
                            TO TAKE MORE IRANIAN OIL.</p>
                        <p>5. SPEAKING AGAIN "VERY PRIVATELY,” HOVEYDA SAID DANGEROUS SITUATION
                            DEVELOPING IN GULF WHICH IS "IRAN'S <pb n="3" xml:id="d46-03" facs="d46-03"/>JUGULAR VEIN" HAS ALSO ADDED GREATLY TO SHAH'S
                            CONCERN SINCE HE BELIEVES IRAN IS ONLY COUNTRY IN GULF REGION THAT CAN
                            MAKE CONTRIBUTION TO STABILITY OF THAT VITAL AREA WHICH IS SO ESSENTIAL
                            NOT ONLY TO IRAN BUT ALSO TO JAPAN, EUROPE AND US AND HE NEEDS US
                            COOPERATION TO HELP ASSURE STABILITY AND SECURITY THERE. THIS DEEP
                            CONCERN COUPLED WITH SHAH'S HIGH EXPECTATIONS AFTER WASHINGTON VISIT MAY
                            HAVE LED TO HIS PRESENT FEELING OF "DECEPTIoN" THAT NOTHING SEEMED TO BE
                            MOVING ALTHOUGH FOUR MONTHS HAD PASSED SINCE HIS VISIT.</p>
                        <p>6. COMMENT: WE HEARD VERY RECENTLY THAT SHAH WAS GETTING RESTLESS BUT WE
                            DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS SENSE OF FRUSTRATION HAD REACHED SUCH A PITCH.
                            WHILE WE OF COURSE REALIZE THAT ALL HIS REQUESTS cANNOT BE MET, WE DO
                            URGE THAT WE DO ALL WE CAN TO RESPOND AS FAVORABLY AS POSSIBE WHEREVER
                            WE CAN, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE SEEMS TO BE GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT
                            AFTER 1971 THE FUTURE STABILITY AND SECURITY OF FREE WORLD INTERESTS IN
                            GULF (AN AREA OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO JAPAN AND NATO FROM WHICH US NETS
                            ONE AND HALF BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM US OIL COMPANY SALES) WILL
                            ALMOST INEVITABLY DEPEND TO VERY CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ON IRAN - THE ONLY

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> explained that he had
                            come to the United States because of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            concern about the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 U.S. foreign
                            military sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>) credit to Iran.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had
                            informed him that since Congress had not passed the FMS legislation, the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 credit agreement could not be
                            signed until later, perhaps April, when Congress had acted. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is concerned because of further
                            payments it must make on its F-4's this year for which there is at
                            present no provision in the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> budget
                            that has been submitted to the Majlis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> had to determine whether or not there was liable
                            to be a problem with the credit and, if so, perhaps make some
                            accommodation in the Iranian budget for it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is thinking in terms of a $100 million
                            credit again this year, although until Congress completed action on the
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> legislation, we could not give
                            any assurance on this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> also expressed the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s concern about the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s intention to include at least 50%
                            private credit in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 credit. He
                            said that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was hoping for a 75/25
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>/private credit split, the same
                            as last year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> also
                            expressed concern about high interest rates on the credit, especially
                            the private credit portion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said that although the
                            days of 6 1/8% <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit seem to be
                            gone this year, he noted Mr. Burns' opinion that the U.S. economy has
                            reached a peak and is beginning to cool. This could lead to lower
                            interest rates by the time the credit is negotiated; however, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> believed that the
                            interest rate on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credits would
                            probably still be about 7 ½% or higher, with private credit at 9% or so.
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d47-02" facs="d47-02"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName>, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would do the best it could for
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> then explained Iran's
                            economic and financial situation. He said that there had been a 25%
                            increase in defense expenditures for next year so that about half of the
                            ordinary budget will be spent on defense. This means that all other
                            sectors of the budget had to be pared and these cuts put additional
                            pressure on the development budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> explained that in addition to defense allocations
                            in the ordinary budget, military construction (about $100 million) is to
                            be charged to the development budget. Even some of the civilian
                            projects, such as telecommunications, have a large military element. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> added that expenditures
                            of foreign loans for military purposes are not shown in the budget,
                            although the servicing of these loans is shown.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> also commented that the
                            Iraqi situation had required the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to
                            squeeze all of its ordinary expenditures except education during the
                            current Iranian year in order to obtain $7 million to meet emergency
                            costs. Development expenditures were not affected only because they
                            could not legally be touched.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s
                            question as to when, as an economist, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> would begin to worry over excessive defense
                            spending, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> said he was
                            already concerned. His main problem was with large defense purchases
                            abroad and, although he thought the World Bank's estimate of Iran's debt
                            service ratio was high, it did point up a difficult problem. Most
                            defense loans are short and medium term (average about 4 ½ years) at
                            high interest rates. Loans from the U.K. and Italy had more favorable
                            interest rates than U.S. loans, but required large down payments (22%
                            for U.K.; 10% for Italy).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> continued that these
                            large military expenses are worrying. In today's circumstances (British
                            withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, tension with Iraq) top priority has to
                            go to defense. However, if the U.S. credit is to be a 50-50 <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>/private funded credit at high interest
                            rates, this may be impossible for Iran to bear and he (<persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName>) may have to ask the Shah to
                            reconsider the credit and use Iran's own resources cutting back other
                            programs where necessary rather than borrowing at such a cost.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> continued that it was a
                            most crucial decision whether or not to allow the economy to slow down
                            in such fields as agriculture and industry so that funds could be spent
                            for defense purposes. If it is true that Britain leaves the Gulf in
                            1971, then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> said Iran
                            will have to be a pivot of stability in the area; however, this means
                            not merely defense, for a stable economy is what will really sustain
                            Iran in these circumstances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> agreed and said that Iran's economic stability
                            affects not only Iran itself, but also has implications for the whole
                            region.</p>

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<lb/> WASHINGTON<lb/> February 23, 1970</p>
                        <p>Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                        <p>Your letter was most welcome, not only because it is helpful to have your
                            views but also because I appreciate the opportunity to exchange thoughts
                            with you from time to time. This is indeed a time of uncertainty in your
                            part of the world—a condition that makes even more difficult your task
                            of achieving for Iran both the security and the well-being and
                            prosperity you are striving to establish. As you know, your thoughts and
                            mine coincide at many points on this subject, and a number of the
                            positions I expressed during my Asian trip last summer—as you have
                            noted-would apply to the problems in your region as well.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, you may be assured of my firm intention to maintain
                            our cooperation with you to insure Iran's continuing capacity for
                            defense. I am pleased that our respective defense experts are in
                            constant touch. Careful attention is being given to the two specific
                            subjects you mention. I am happy to say that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>, after review of our worldwide
                            requirements, is able to increase the number of Air Force technicians in
                            Iran. The problem of pilot training-involving as it does our own
                            requirements and commitments to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries as well as to good friends like Iran—has taken a little longer
                            than was expected.</p>
                        <p>We place great importance, as you do, on the integrity and stability of
                            Saudi Arabia. The news of increasing cooperation between you and His
                            Majesty King Faisal is welcome, for there is no question that
                            cooperation among the states around the Persian Gulf is in our mutual
                            interest and in the interests of the free world. We are reassured by the
                            efforts you are making to bring this about.</p>
                        <p>On the broader Middle Eastern front, you will be aware of the steady
                            increase in military activity and the concerns that the Soviet Union has
                            expressed. Our policy remains as I <pb n="2" xml:id="d48-02" facs="d48-02"/>described it to you. We are prepared to do what we
                            can to help restore observance of the cease-fire and to help create a
                            framework for negotiation. But we cannot do this in the absence of a
                            will to peace on the part of both sides in the area. We have been
                            disappointed by the unconstructive Soviet attitude.</p>
                        <p>I am especially grateful for your words in support of my efforts at
                            resolving the Viet-Nam conflict, and for your shared hope that our
                            policy will result in a just and speedy conclusion of the war. Iran's
                            own humanitarian efforts in Viet-Nam have been helpful to that country
                            and encouraging to those other nations that share the burden of the war.
                            There will be a continuing need for civilian assistance in Viet-Nam, and
                            we hope that Iran will be among those providing it.</p>
                        <p>Iran's desire to increase its oil revenues is clearly understood. As
                            promised when you were here, we have carefully examined the various ways
                            in which liftings from Iran might be increased. There are, as you know,
                            limits on what we as a government can do, and I cannot report any
                            breakthroughs at this point. However, we will continue to work with your
                            officials to see whether there are ways in which we could help.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> shares with me still
                            the pleasant recollection of your October visit to Washington and she
                            joins me in sending to you and Her Imperial Majesty our best wishes for
                            your personal happiness and the well-being of your nation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You asked <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Peter Flanigan</persName>, in the
                            presence of the Shah, to make every effort to close the gap between
                            projected Iranian oil sales in 1970 and Iranian financial needs under
                            its development program. The gap is $155 million. Despite intensive
                            conversations with US members of the Iranian Oil Consortium, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> now sees no prospect
                            of persuading the Consortium to increase its Iranian oil liftings in the
                            coming year. The Iranians have also been told that they should expect no
                            help in 1970 from the report of the Task Force on Oil Imports.</p>
                        <p>However, the Vice Chairman of the state-owned National Iranian Oil
                            Company (NIOC) has approached Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> with the following story. Norwegian agents have
                            supposedly approached Iran about buying Iranian oil to ship to Cuba as
                            part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s commitment to Cuba.
                            (The Norwegians, in the past, have been shipping 5-8 million tons of
                            Soviet oil to Cuba, partly to be used in Cuba and partly to be sold
                            elsewhere in the Caribbean area.) The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is now apparently short of oil for export and has
                            directed the Norwegians to buy in the Middle East, for shipment to Cuba.
                            The Norwegians would prefer to buy from Iran, but have made clear they
                            will buy from Iraq if Iran will not sell. That would help the Iraqis
                            find a market for oil from fields they are developing with Soviet help,
                            independent of the Iraq Petroleum Company which is controlled by Western
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>Against that background, the Iranian question is: Given US attitudes
                            toward trade with Cuba, what would be the US position on such a
                            sale?</p>
                        <p>The first issue raised by this approach is its veracity. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has no information to substantiate the
                            statement that Norwegians have in the past been involved in shipping
                            Soviet oil to Cuba or that Soviet oil has been sold elsewhere in the
                            Caribbean. According to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, Soviet oil
                            shipments <pb n="2" xml:id="d50-02" facs="d50-02"/>to Cuba have always
                            been handled directly by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            almost entirely in Soviet tankers. Also, Cuban consumption is only 4
                            million tons, with another million in petroleum products. So the facts
                            do not ring true.</p>
                        <p>But if the proposal is legitimate, the case for telling the Iranians we
                            would not object includes these points:</p>
                        <p>1. You have promised to help the Shah if possible to increase his oil
                            revenues. Despite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName>'s
                            discussions with US members of the oil consortium, there is no
                            indication whatsoever that the Consortium will increase its liftings
                            from Iran this year. Since our review of oil import policy will not help
                            Iran, the only substantial way we can now see to help Iran increase its
                            revenues is by acquiescing in this sale to the Norwegians, knowing that
                            the destination would be Cuba.</p>
                        <p>2. According to the Iranian argument, refusal would result in an Iraqi
                            sale. Oil would not be denied to Cuba. An Iraqi enterprise designed with
                            Soviet help to undercut Western producers would be assisted. Instead of
                            $100 million which Iran would spend in the US, Iraq would gain revenue
                            to be spent elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The core of the case against telling the Iranians we would not object is
                            two-fold — it would erode the credibility and effectiveness of our
                            economic denial policy against Cuba, and it would be subject to
                            interpretation as a softening of the US attitude toward Cuba — or at
                            least as indicative of a disposition to soften our policy.</p>
                        <p>Both of these judgments are based on the almost certain circumstance that
                            it would become known that we acquiesced in the arrangement. Private oil
                            intelligence is extremely sophisticated and would soon learn about the
                            deal. Moreover, the Soviets would certainly know and are likely to draw
                            conclusions about our approach to Cuban policy, or at least about our
                            priorities.</p>
                        <p>Our economic denial policy is intended to isolate Cuba from the Western
                            world, because of its conduct in stimulating subversion; hamper its
                            economic growth, and thus reduce its capacity to export revolution; and
                            increase the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s burden, by keeping
                            Cuba dependent on Soviet aid and supply. This policy is also responsive
                            to OAS decisions to sever all commercial ties with Cuba.</p>
                        <p>We carry out this policy by a complete interruption of our own commercial
                            and financial transactions; control over US-owned subsidiaries abroad
                            through the Cuban Assets Control legislation; and use of moral suasion
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d50-03" facs="d50-03"/>to convince non-Bloc
                            industrialized countries to limit their trade with Cuba. The last is
                            most difficult to accomplish, and it has been increasingly hard to
                            convince European countries and Canada not to trade with Cuba. We are,
                            however, committed to try, and you also pledged in your campaign
                            speeches to redouble our efforts to persuade our allies not to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>In this case, it is not a question of the oil itself. Cuba will get the
                            oil, whatever we do. The Soviets will pay in either case. The point is
                            what our acquiescence will be taken to signify. A policy of moral
                            suasion stands or falls on how firmly we hold to it and how much we are
                            believed. Permitting this arrangement would put the credibility of our
                            policy in doubt. Moreover, if it should become known publicly, we would
                            have to enforce against Iran the legislative prohibition on PL 480 aid
                            to countries assisting Cuba.Given the current spate of assertions coming
                            out of Latin America, and being recirculated by Pravda out of Moscow,
                            that perhaps Cuba should be reintegrated economically into the
                            inter-American system, knowledge of the Iranian arrangement would be
                            taken to be an indication of US willingness to soften our stand on Cuba.
                            This belief could in turn stimulate initiatives for a rapprochement.</p>
                        <p>The difficult choice posed here is: In terms of our desire to help
                            increase Iran's income for its well-executed development program, we
                            should acquiesce in this Iranian sale if it proves a realistic proposal.
                            In terms of our maintaining the credibility of the present policy line
                            on Cuba, however, we should not.</p>
                        <p>At best, however, we could give Iran our tacit approval with the clear
                            understanding that we would have to cut off their PL 480 when the deal
                            became known to us from other sources, as it surely would. Although the
                            PL 480 is not that important substantively, it is dubious that Iran
                            would want to pursue the deal against our expressed interests. There
                            does therefore not seem to be much in it.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have just noted a copy of Tehran's A-69 of February 14. While the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decision with respect to future
                            military credit sales to Iran is happily not the responsibility of this
                            desk, I wish to enter strong exception to portions of the rationale
                            advanced by Embassy Tehran as these involve considerations affecting
                            Arab states on the western side of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy states that "hostile forces stand ready" to fill "a vacuum
                            which will assertedly be left in the Gulf region by the British
                            departure. This may reflect information not available to us. If not, it
                            would appear over-drawn if not inaccurate. The most serious theoretical
                            threat to us in the Gulf in future would come from significant Soviet
                            naval activities there. These I do not expect, but it is hardly likely
                            that Iran would feel able - or willing - to oppose them, particularly
                            since Iran is one of only two Gulf states which have been hospitable to
                            Soviet Naval visits so far. As far as Arab forces are concerned, those
                            of major powers (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria, Iraq) are
                            pinned down elsewhere by the Israelis and Kurds, and we see no sign that
                            this situation is likely to be significantly altered. It is true that
                            the removal of British forces will make them unavailable for security
                            purposes, but local forces are fast a-building to cope with local
                            security threats. Abu Dhabi now has military forces totalling over 4000,
                            and a Hawker Hunter squadron is being activated. Bahrain, Qatar and
                            Dubai also possess significant (in local terms) military and
                            quasi-military establishments, totalling 4-5,000 men. And the Trucial
                            Oman Scouts, which may be taken over by a new Arab federation, remains a
                            well-drilled force of almost 2000 men. These forces would appear
                            entirely adequate to cope with any local insurrection which can be dealt
                            with in military terms.</p>
                        <p>The future threat to the Arab states of the Gulf is subversive, rather
                            than military. For this purpose, substantial Iranian forces are likely
                            to prove not only unnecessary but may be positively harmful. This is
                            because substantial Iranian forces directed towards the Gulf area are
                            likely to be regarded by the <pb n="2" xml:id="d51-02" facs="d51-02"/>Arabs more as a threat than a reassurance. They could regard
                            themselves as forced to the only countervailing support available,
                            namely the major radical Arab states (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and/or Iraq) - unless, of course, one assumes an appeal
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The fact that PRSYG forces
                            have attacked SAG units at Wadiyah is hardly relevant. This is not in
                            the Gulf area, the Saudis have shown themselves able to contain this
                            threat and the basic cause of that issue was a boundary problem. The
                            latter do not exist in the Gulf area except vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia
                            itself, and I find it hard to conceive of Iran intervening on either
                            side in that one.</p>
                        <p>Tehran reporting persists in seeing more "tact and "flexibility" in the
                            Iranian position on the Tunbs and Abu Musa than is apparently visible to
                            the Shaykhs of Ras al-Khaimah and Sharja. Since these worthies are
                            prepared to do virtually everything Iran may want except surrender
                            sovereignty over these islands, it seems clear that the Iranian position
                            is, in fact, provocative and uncompromising. The Shah has shown
                            statesmenship over the Bahrain issue, but on these lesser claims Iran
                            still seems to be enaged in Tunb-thumping.</p>
                        <p>As to Iranian concern over future stability in Saudi Arabia, we welcome
                            all efforts to strengthen our benighted clients. Because of Iran's
                            well-known ties with Israel, however, as well as the suspicions raised
                            in Arab breasts by Iranian military muscle-flexing vis-a-vis the Gulf,
                            Iran must be exceedingly discreet and wary in assuring that what is done
                            for Saudi Arabia actually contributes to stability of the House of Saud
                            rather than the reverse.]</p>
                        <p>All of which is not to argue against our annual military credit sales
                            tranche to Iran but rather to place in perspective some of the arguments
                            adduced by Tehran to support the therefor.</p>

                        <p>11th March, 1970.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>I thank you for your letter of 23rd February, and I was very glad to
                            receive your views and opinions on various questions of mutual interest
                            to our two countries.</p>
                        <p>The kind attention which you have given to the matter regarding the
                            training of Iranian pilots and the despatch of Blue Suit personnel to my
                            country is highly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>You are no doubt aware, Mr. President, of the extent to which I am
                            devoted to the cause of general disarmament and world peace. But so long
                            as this achievement is out of reach we cannot leave the fate of our
                            country in the hands of chance, and perforce we must sustain a
                            sufficient military force capable of defending us against any potential
                            enemies. Meanwhile, we shall direct our efforts to the maintenance of
                            the very high rate of social and economic development which we have set
                            ourselves to pursue.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the realization of all these plans,we would have
                            expected particular attention to be paid to the question of oil,
                            especially as I had previously stated that we would use the revenue in
                            dollars accruing from the sale of our oil in your country for the
                            purchase of arms and other equipment from the United States of America
                            which at the same time would perhaps help your balance of payments. So
                            far however, not only has no substantial progress been made in this
                            respect, but the conditions for procuring our requirements from your
                            country have become more and more difficult.</p>
                        <p>From a first indication, it appears that terms and conditions for the 8th
                            tranche credit are extremely hard. Indeed they have progressively become
                            harder ever since 1964 when arrangements for purchases of arms were
                            initiated. I am now informed that for the 8th tranche, it is suggested
                            that only fifty per cent of the total credit required to cover Iran's
                            arms orders for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 will be made
                            available by the Department of Defence and the balance has to be
                            obtained from commercial banks in New York.</p>
                        <p>You are well aware, Mr. President, that in the present market conditions
                            it is not an easy matter to raise over $50m in New <pb n="2" xml:id="d52-02" facs="d52-02"/>York. Indeed banks can only provide
                            such facilities by obtaining funds from Europe, with a consequent
                            interest rate of 10 1/4 - 10 1/2%.</p>
                        <p>The part of the credit provided by the Department of Defence seems to
                            bear interest at the abnormally high rate of about 71/2 %. There is of
                            course the additional cost of the guarantee to be given by the
                            Department of Defence and the commitment fee of New York banks.</p>
                        <p>Looking ahead at our future requirements, these worsening conditions
                            place an intolerable burden on the resources of a country irrevocably
                            committed to rapid economic development and social progress while
                            maintaining sufficient military forces for her own security.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President I leave the judgement of this matter in your own hands and
                            I shall be glad if you will give it every consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Empress joins me in sending to you, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and your family our best wishes for your personal
                            happiness and the continued prosperity of your great nation.</p>

                                sustain military pressure on Baghdad Government, by means of arms,
                                training, food, and a porous border. Israel supported Iran in this
                                effort… If Soviet Union is happy over direction Kurdish situation
                                taking in Iraq, it may have our friends to thank. It is doubtful
                                Kurds could have held out over last 10 years had they not had Iran's
                                help.” (Ibid.)</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> ASKED ME TO CALL TODAY
                            (MARCH 12.) HE SAID SHAH INSTRUCTED HIM LAST EVENING TO CALL ME IN TO
                            REMIND ME OF SHAH'S TALK WITH ME JAN 14 (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) RE. SOVIET-IRAQ THREAT TO MIDDLE EAST. AS SHAH HAD
                            FEARED, SOVIETS HAD ACHIEVED NEXT STEP IN THEIR PROGRAM (REFTEL) WITH
                            FORMATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS IRAQ-KURDISH PROVINCE. HE SAID BARZANI HAD
                            INFORMED GOI IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE THREE DAYS AGO THAT SINCE IRAQ GOVT
                            HAD ACCEPTED AUTONOMOUS KURDISH PROVINCE AND ALL OTHER IMPORTANT KURDISH
                            DEMANDS, THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY VALID EXCUSE FOR KURDS CONTINUE THEIR
                            STRUGGLE AGAINST BAGHDAD GOVT. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> SAID JUST AS SHAH HAD BEEN RIGHT WELL IN ADVANCE
                            IN HIS PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT SOVIETS AND RADICAL ARABS WERE UP TO IN
                            PENETRATING OTHER PARTS OF MIDDLE EAST (I.E. LIBYA, SUDAN, SOMALI,
                            SOUTHERN YEMEN, ETC.) HE HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT WHAT SOVIETS WERE UP TO IN
                            IRAQ. BAGHDAD'S CAPITULATION TO KURDISH INSISTANCE ON AUTONOMY WAS,
                            ACCORDING TO RELIABLE INFORMATION, A DIRECT RESULT OF MOSCOW'S PRESSURE
                            ON BAGHDAD.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH WANTED TOP LEVEL <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO KNOW THAT
                            AGREEMENT BETWEEN KURDS AND IRAQ GOVT WAS VERY GRAVE DEVELOPMENT GREATLY
                            INCREASING THREAT <pb n="2" xml:id="d53-02" facs="d53-02"/>TO GULF AREA
                            AND ARABIAN PENINSULA BECAUSE:</p>
                        <p>(A) AS BBC BROADCAST SAID THIS MORNING IT WILL RELEASE "ABOUT 20,000
                            IRAQI TROOPS FOR DEPLOYMENT TO GULF.”</p>
                        <p>(B) IT INCREASES IRAQI RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES FOR SUBVERSION AND
                            OTHER MISCHIEF AGAINST SMALL GULF STATES.</p>
                        <p>(C) IT CLEAR THAT IRAQI GOVT IS VERY MUCH UNDER INFLUENCE OF SOVIETS
                            BECAUSE OF ITS DEPENDENCE ON SOVIET MILITARY AND OTHER AID FOR
                            SURVIVAL.</p>
                        <p>(D) IT WILL PREPARE WAY FOR NEXT STEP IN SOVIET PLAN WHICH IS EVENTUAL
                            TRANSFORMATION OF AUTONOMOUS IRAQI KURDISH PROVINCE INTO AUTONOMOUS
                            KURDISH, STATE WITH VIEW TO ENLARGING KURDISH STATE UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY
                            HAS CONTINGUOUS BORDERS WITH SOVIET UNION WHICH WILL THUS ENABLE SOVIETS
                            TO OVERCOME PRESENT TURKEY-IRAN BARRIER TO THEIR DIRECT PENETRATION OF
                            MIDDLE EAST (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>(E) SOVIETS WILL NOT (<gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOW) BEGIN TO
                            PLAY ON STRONG NATIONAL SENTIMENT OF KURDISH PEOPLE TO STIR UP TURKISH
                            AND IRANIAN KURDS IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES HOLDING OUT BAIT OF AN
                            ENLARGED INDEPENDENT KURDISH STATE.</p>
                        <p>3. SHAH ASKED HOVEYDA TO LET US KNOW THAT, THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN SHAH'S
                            VIEW MADE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER OUR COOPERATION IN HELPING IRAN TO
                            EQUIP AND DEVELOP ITS FORCES SO THAT MINIMUM NECESSARY DETERRENT
                            STRENGTH COULD BE DEVELOPED PRIOR TO BRITISH PULL-OUT FROM GULF END OF
                            1971. FURTHERMORE SHAH HOPED THESE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD LEAD TO
                            RECONSIDERATION OF <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> INTEREST RATES
                            AND CREDIT MATTER FOR NEXT TRANCHE, PARTICULARLY GRANTING OF 75 PER CENT
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> 25 PER CENT PRIVATE CREDIT FOR
                            NEXT TRANCHE, AS IRAN'S FINANCIAL RESOURCES WERE STRETCHED TO LIMIT.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> RECALLED THAT IN OUR
                            LAST MEETING HE HAD ASKED ME ON PERSONAL BASIS WHETHER THOUGHT FMS
                            CREDIT COULD BE INCREASED BEYOND ANNUAL TRANCHE OF DOLS 100 MILLION AND
                            I HAD REPLIED THAT IN MY PERSONAL VIEW BEST WE COULD HOPE FOR WAS
                            CONTINUATION OF DOLS 100 MILLION CREDIT PER ANNUM. HE HAD REPORTED THIS
                            TO SHAH WHO HAD SAID THAT THIS WAS DISCOURAGING BECAUSE WHILE HE DID NOT
                            WISH TO EQUIP HIS FORCES FROM A VARIETY OF "OTHER SOURCES,” <pb n="3" xml:id="d53-03" facs="d53-03"/>IF WE COULD NOT DO MORE TO HELP ON
                            THIS MATTER HE MIGHT RELUCTANTLY HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE IN VIEW OF
                            IRAN'S DESPERATE NEED TO BUILD MINIMUM OFFENSIVE STRENGTH BEFORE BRITISH
                            PULL-OUT FROM GULF. IN THIS CONNECTION <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS HEARD SECRETARY LAIRD VERY RECENTLY ASKED FOR
                            INCREASE IN FMS FUNDS TO DOLS 1 BILLION IN ORDER TO BETTER IMPLEMENT
                            "NIXON DOCTRINE.” IN VIEW OF VITAL IMPORTANCE OF GULF T0 AMERICAN AND
                            FREE WORLD INTERESTS, SHAH HOPED MOST EARNESTLY THAT IF THIS WENT
                            THROUGH IRAN WOULD BENEFIT THROUGH INCREASE IN AMOUNT OF OUR FMS CREDIT
                            FOR IRAN RESULTING FROM INCREASED FUNDS AVAILABLE.</p>
                        <p>5. I TOLD <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> I WOULD OF
                            COURSE REPORT PROMPTLY SHAH'S VIEWS. I SAID WE WERE, AS HE KNEW VERY
                            SYMPATHETIC TO IRAN'S PROBLEM AND AGREED THAT A STRONG, STABLE IRAN
                            COULD MAKE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN GULF. THIS WAS
                            WHY WE HAD GIVEN IRAN FAVORED TREATMENT IN A NUMBER OF MATTERS WHICH I
                            DETAILED TO HIM (TEHRAN 7481). RE <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            CREDIT WE WERE SYMPATHETIC BUT TILL CONGRESS ACTED AND WE KNEW WHAT WE
                            HAD TO WORK WITH I COULD NOT OF COURSE, GIVE HIM ANY ASSURANCES.</p>
                        <p>6. WOULD APPRECIATE DEPT'S COMMENTS INCLUDING INFO ON PROPOSAL FOR <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> INCREASE ATTRIBUTED TO SECY <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">LAIRD</persName>. SINCE I AM SEEING COURT MINISTER
                            ALAM MARCH 14 ANYTHING THAT CAN BE SENT ME BY THEN WOULD BE MUCH

                        <p>Regarding the continued strong desire that the Shah be helped in the
                            financing of his development program, I had an additional talk with
                            Collado of Standard of Jersey as our prime contact with the Consortium.
                            In addition, in accordance with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s suggestion that contact be made with the
                            British Embassy, I talked with their Economic Counselor, Derrick
                            Mitchell.</p>
                        <p>The current status of the negotiations is that the Shah is asking for
                            $1,155,000,000 of oil lifting by the Consortium out of the proceeds of
                            which he will repay the $83,000,000 of advances loaned to Iran by the
                            Consortium. The Consortium has agreed to a lifting of $1,010,000,000
                            worth of oil.</p>
                        <p>I have urged on Collado and Mitchell that in addition to its lifting of
                            $1,010,000,000 of oil the Consortium agree to defer further the
                            $83,000,000 of debt and make available an additional $7,000,000 thus
                            providing the Shah with $1,100,000,000 in the upcoming year. While this
                            is a stopgap solution, it will meet the problem, at least at the current
                            time.</p>
                        <p> Collado made no commitment to follow the suggestion, however, he did
                            indicate that it might be a reasonable solution and led me to believe
                            that he would pursue it. Mitchell indicated that he thought this could
                            be a helpful solution and agreed to urge the suggestion on the British
                            members of the Consortium.</p>
                        <p>I have not informed the Iranians that this suggestion has been made.</p>

                            WENT OVER AND OVER AGAIN REASONS WHY, IN HIS VIEW, WE SHOULD HELP HIM
                            OBTAIN MORE CREDIT OR FUNDS (THROUGH OIL) FOR IRAN TO PURCHASE US
                            MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND THUS CARRY OUT ITS MILITARY BUILD-UP WHICH HE
                            BELIEVES ESSENTIAL IF PEACE AND STABILITY IN GULF IS TO BE MAINTAINED.
                            FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OF TALK.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH FIRST REFERRED TO RECENT KURDISH-BAGHDAD ACCORD WHICH HE SAID
                            WOULD IMPROVE IRAQ GOVTS CAPACITY FOR MISCHIEF IN GULF AND, FOR PRESENT
                            AT LEAST, STRENGTHEN ITS OVERALL POSITION. THIS AGREEMENT WAS REACHED IN
                            GOOD PART AS RESULT OF MOSCOW'S PRESSURE ON BAGHDAD AND EFFORS OF IRAQI
                            COMMUNISTS WHO HAD BEEN REPRESENTED IN BOTH DELEGATIONS THAT CONDUCTED
                            TALKS. SHAH'S HOPE WAS THAT ACCORD WOULD NOT LAST BUT TIME ALONE WOULD
                            TELL.</p>
                        <p>3. HE THEN REFERRED TO OUR JAN 14 TALK (REF A) AND REVIEWED WHAT HE
                            REFERS TO AS SOVIET "GRAND DESIGN" FOR PENETRATING ARAB PENINSULA AND
                            MIDDLE EAST VIA IRAQ WITH LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE A COMMUNIST INFLUENCED
                            INDEPENDENT KURDISH STATE TO FORM CONTINGUOUS CORRIDOR BETWEEN SOVIET
                            AND ARAB WORLDS. HE SAW SOVIET INFLUENCE IN BAGHDAD STEADILY INCREASING
                            WITH SOVIETS SUPPLYING MIG-S, 130 MM ARTILLERY, TANKS AND OTHER ITEMS OF
                            MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID HE REFERRED TO SOVIET ASSISTANCE IN CREATION
                            OF IRAQ NAVAL FORCE IN GULF AND PORT FACILITIES IN BASRA TO SERVICE
                            IRAQ, AND SOVIET NAVAL VESSELS. JUST AS SOVIETS HAD PENETRATED AND
                            ESTABLISHED MAJOR PRESENCE IN MEDITERRANEAN THEY NOW (RPT NOW) WORKING
                            TO ESTABLISH SIMILAR TYPE PRESENCE IN GULF THROUGH IRAQ.</p>
                        <p>4. HE CONVINCED GULF CAN ONLY BE SAVED BY COOPERATION OF IRAN, SAUDI
                            ARABIA AND SMALLER MODERATE GULF STATES. (HE SAID HE TOLD KING <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> WHEN LATTER FELT THREATENED
                            THAT IRAN'S DEFENSIVE FRONTIER WAS ON RED SEA JUST AS ARAB GULF STATES
                            WAS ON CASPIAN.) AT SAME TIME IRAN-GULF ARAB SECURITY COOPERATION IS
                            MEANINGLESS UNLESS IRAN POSSESSES STRONG AND CREDIBLE DETERRENT MILITARY
                            POWER. "WHO ELSE IN THE AREA,” HE ASKED, "CAN SUPPLY A CREDIBLE MILITARY
                            DETERRENT IN THE GULF? PAKISTAN, SAUDI ARABIA, THE SMALL WEAK GULF
                            STATES? OF COURSE NOT.”</p>
                        <p>5. HE THEN SAID HE HAD AGAIN CAREFULLY REVIEWED HIS PLANNED MILITARY
                            BUILD-UP IN LIGHT OF MY COMMENTS TO PM HOVEYDA AND ALAM (REF B) ON
                            NON-AVAILABILITY OF MORE THAN $500 MILLION <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS. HE DID NOT SEE WHERE HIS
                            FORCE PLANS COULD BE CUT BACK:</p>
                        <p>(A) FOR AIR FORCE, AFTER NEXT TWO F-4 SQUADRONS RECEIVED IN 1971 HE
                            PLANNED FOUR ADDITIONAL F-4 SQUADRONS BEGINNING 1973 TO BE PHASED IN ONE
                            EACH YEAR THROUGH 1976. THESE ACQUISITIONS, WITH WHAT IRAN ALREADY
                            POSSESSED AND WITH SOME ADDITIONAL C-130'S "ESSENTIAL TO GIVE GROUND
                            FORCES GREATER MOBILITY,” WOULD TOTAL ABOUT FOURTEEN (14) SQUADRONS.
                            FURTHERMORE HE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO REPLACE F-5 SQUADRONS BUT THAT
                            WAS IN FUTURE EVEN THEN HE WOULD HAVE LESS AIRCRAFT THAN IRAQ TO SAY
                            NOTHING OF WHAT SYRIA EGYPT AND OTHER RADICAL ARABS HAD, ALTHOUGH HE
                            BELIEVED HIS AMERICAN TRAINED AND EQUIPPED AIR FORCE WOULD BE MUCH MORE
                            EFFECTIVE.</p>
                        <p>(B) BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESOURCES HIS GROUND FORCES HAD BEEN CUT BACK ON
                            OUR ADVICE TO SIX DIVISIONS TO MAKE THEM MORE COMBAT EFFECTIVE. THEY
                            WOULD BE PERMANENTLY MAINTAINED WITH 80 PERCENT CADRES WITH BALANCE TO
                            BE FILLED IN BY RESERVES AND LIGHT TERRITORIAL FORCES NEEDED TO
                            SUPPLEMENT GENDARMERIE. SIX IRAN DIVISIONS EXACTLY SAME NUMBER AS IRAQ
                            POSSESSED AND WAS ABSOLUTE MINIMUM. FURTHERMORE THESE DIVISIONS STILL
                            NEEDED SOME COSTLY QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT THROUGH M-47 RETROFIT (WHICH
                            HE "PLANNED TO CARRY OUT”), ADDITIONAL ARTILLERY, AND GREATER MOBILITY
                            INCLUDING AN AIRBORNE CAPABILITY THROUGH ADDITIONAL C-130S.</p>
                        <p>6. HE STRESSED HOSTILITIES IN GULF COULD COME ABOUT THROUGH (A) WEAKNESS
                            OF MODERATE RIPARIAN STATES AND /OR (B) MISCALCULATION ON PART OF
                            RADICAL ARABS UNLESS THERE IS STRONG AND CREDIBLE IRAN DETERRENT. HE HAD
                            VERY RECENTLY TOLD SOVIET AMBASSADOR THAT IRAN HAD NO RPT NO INTENTION
                            OF ATTACKING IRAQ BUT THAT IF IRAQ CREATED TROUBLE IN GULF IRAN "WOULD
                            PUNISH IRAQ VERY BADLY.” IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO TALK THIS WAY, HE SAID,
                            BUT SOVIETS AS WELL AS IRAQ MUST SEE THAT THIS THREAT OF RETALIATION WAS
                            CREDIBLE AND COULD BE CARRIED OUT. THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR. DETERRENT TO
                            RADICAL AGGRESSION OR MASSIVE SUBVERSION AGAINST-MODERATE GULF
                            STATES.</p>
                        <p>7. IN SUM, HE DID NOT SEE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MATERIALLY CUT BACK
                            HIS FORCES IF PEACE AND STABILITY IN GULF ARE TO BE MAINTAINED AFTER
                            BRITISH PULL-OUT. THIS WHY HE NEEDED TO EITHER (A) OBTAIN $800 MILLION
                            IN CREDIT FROM US OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970-74) OR (B) BE ABLE TO SELL MORE OIL IN US WHICH
                            WOULD ENABLE HIM TO PAY FOR EQUIPMENT WITH OIL MONEY USING 100 PERCENT
                            OF PROCEEDS OF ADDITIONAL SALES TO US FOR PURCHASE OF AMERICAN EQUIPMENT
                            AS HE HAD PROMISED TO DO.</p>
                        <p>8. IN REPLY, I TOOK SAME LINE WITH SHAH AS WITH ALAM (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss> B) EXPLAINING VERY SERIOUS
                            DIFFICULTIES WE FACED: WHY I COULD GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT THAT MORE THAN
                            $100 MILLION <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> OR OTHER CREDIT WOULD
                            BE AVAILABLE ANNUALLY, AND WHY IT SEEMED VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH
                            PRIORITIES OF EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION WITHIN REALISTIC CALCULATION OF
                            AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND CREDIT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AVAILABLE TRAINED
                            MANPOWER AND IRAN'S ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY. I ALSO MENTIONED I HAD HEARD
                            PRIVATELY THAT LARGE US BANKS WERE KEEPING CLOSE EYE ON IRAN'S FOREIGN
                            DEBT SERVICING RATION IN LIGHT OF RECENT REPORT ON IT BY IMF WHICH
                            INDICATED RATIO CLIMBING RATHER SHARPLY.</p>
                        <p>9. SHAH REACTED AT LENGTH AND WITH CONSIDERABLE EMOTION REVIEWING AGAIN
                            THREAT TO GULF AND IRAN'S VITAL INTERESTS: FACT IRAN IS DEFENDING VITAL
                            INTERESTS OF US, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, JAPAN AND FREE
                            WORLD IN GULF: SPECIAL OFFER HE HAD MADE US TO TIE ADDITIONAL OIL
                            REVENUES FROM US TO PURCHASE OF US EQUIPMENT: UNHELPFUL ATTITUDE OF
                            CONSORTIUM MEMBERS: FACT THAT IF WE WOULD NOT HELP HIM HE WOULD BE
                            FORCED TO TURN ELSEWHERE. HE SAID HE HEARS FRANCE IS OFFERING GREECE 15
                            YEAR CREDITS AT THREE PERCENT INTEREST FOR PURCHASE OF MIRAGES: <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> PREPARED TO OFFER SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER
                            RATES THAN OUR SHOCKINGLY HIGH <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            CREDIT OFFER WHICH SAMII INDICATED WOULD TOTAL ABOUT 9 PERCENT: AND
                            SOVIETS ARE OFFERING TWO AND HALF PERCENT INTEREST OVER LONG TERM. WHY
                            COULD NOT WE OFFER CREDIT ON TERMS LIKE OUR <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ALLIES AND SOVIET UNION? HE CONCLUDED WITH STATEMENT
                            HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE DID NOT WANT TO HELP HIM IMPLEMENT
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> DOCTRINE IN GULF AREA
                            WHERE OUR AND OUR ALLIES INTERESTS WERE ALSO THREATENED. ONLY COURSE
                            OPEN TO HIM WAS TO REAPPRAISE HIS PLAN FOR ACQUISITION OF US EQUIPMENT
                            IN LIGHT OF FACT WE WOULD NOT EXTEND ADDITIONAL CREDIT AND FIT WHAT HE
                            COULD INTO $100 TRANCHES FOR NEXT FIVE YEARS TURNING ELSEWHERE FOR
                            REMAINDER. FOR US IT WAS MATTER OF CREDIT OR PERMISSION TO SELL OIL IN
                            US FOR HIM IT WAS IRAN'S SECURITY AND SURVIVAL.</p>
                        <p>10. I SAID WITH ALL DUE RESPECT HIM MISTAKEN TO BELIEVE WE DID NOT "WANT"
                            TO HELP HIM. I REVIEWED IN DETAIL "VERY SPECIAL CONSIDERATION" WE HAD
                            SHOWN IRAN PRECISELY BECAUSE WE DID WANT TO DO ALL WE POSSIBLY COULD TO
                            HELP HIM (I.E., PILOT TRAINING: BLUE SUITERS: <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT; MAINTAINING IN IRAN ONE OF LARGEST MAAG
                            MISSIONS IN WORLD FAVORED EX-IM BANK TREATMENT: ETC.). HOWEVER I THOUGHT
                            OUR FRIENDS SHOULD RECOGNIZE WE WERE BEARING UNBELIEVABLY HEAVY BURDENS,
                            HAD DESPERATELY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL AND B/P PROBLEMS, AND WE JUST DID
                            NOT HAVE RESOURCES TO SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS REST OF WORLD BROUGHT TO OUR
                            DOORSTEP. INSOFAR AS IRAN HAVING TO TURN ELSEWHERE HE MUST OF COURSE DO
                            WHAT HE THOUGHT BEST AND WE WOULD RESPECT HIS DECISION. HOWEVER IF HE
                            TURNED SUBSTANTIALLY TOWARDS SOVIETS FOR EQUIPMENT, I WANTED TO SAY ON
                            PURELY PERSONAL BASIS RESULTING FROM MY FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE IN
                            CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS, THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT SEEMED BOUND TO
                            STIMULATE INTENSIVE CONGRESSIONAL EXAMINATION DURING CONSIDERATION OF
                            FUTURE <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT LEGISLATION. THIS WAS
                            IN NO RPT NO SENSE A WARNING BUT SIMPLY STATEMENT OF OBVIOUS.</p>
                        <p>11. SHAH SAID HE DID NOT WANT US TO THINK HE WAS UNGRATEFUL FOR WHAT WE
                            HAD DONE FOR THIS WAS NOT CASE. HOWEVER WHAT WE HAD DONE ORIGINATED
                            LARGELY IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION: AS RESULT OF HIS WASHINGTON VISIT
                            LAST YEAR HE HAD THOUGHT WE WERE PREPARED TO HELP HIM ON OIL PROBLEM
                            WHICH WOULD SOLVE HIS VERY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL SITUATION. HE FELT WE
                            HADN'T RPT NOT REALLY DONE MUCH NEW FOR HIM ALTHOUGH WE HAD CONTINUED
                            PROGRAMS OF PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I SAID
                            WITH SMILE HIS LATTER COMMENT REMINED ME OF A FAMILY STORY MY
                            FATHER-N-LAW USED TO TELL ABOUT A CONSTITUENT WHOM HE HAD HELPED IN MANY
                            WAYS OVER THIRTY YEARS. IN AN IMPORTANT ELECTION SEN. BARKLEY SAID TO
                            THIS CONSTITUENT HE ASSUMED LATTER WOULD VOTE FOR HIM. WHEN CONSTITUENT
                            SAID HE NOT CERTAIN BARKLEY RECOUNTED AT LENGTH ALL HE HAD DONE FOR HIM
                            AND HIS FAMILY OVER 30 YEARS TO WHICH CONSTITUENT REPLIED, "YES, BUT
                            WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY?”</p>
                        <p>12. SHAH LAUGHED, SEEMED TO RELAX AND THEN BECAME SERIOUS AGAIN SAYING HE
                            APPRECIATED WE WERE TRYING HELP HIM BUT WE MUST UNDERSTAND IT WAS FUTURE
                            OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS PEOPLE THAT WAS AT STAKE. HE STILL TRUSTED MOST
                            EARNESTLY PRESIDENT WOULD FIND WAY TO HELP HIM WITH SOME SPECIAL OIL
                            ARRANGEMENT AND THAT WE ALSO WOULD DO SOMETHING TO EASE VERY ONEROUS
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT TERMS DISCUSSED RECENTLY
                            WITH SAMII AS TO INTEREST RATES AND RATIO OF USG TO PRIVATE CREDIT. A
                            SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT ON OIL WOULD DO MORE THAN ANYTHING TO SOLVE PROBLEM
                            OF FINANCING PURCHASE OF US MILITARY EQUIPMENT, WITH WHICH HE WISHED TO
                            EQUIP HIS FORCES, AND WOULD ALSO ENABLE HIM TO CONTINUE HIS PROGRAM OF
                            ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS FOR HIS PEOPLE. AT SAME TIME IT WOULD
                            BENEFIT US INDUSTRY (HE MENTIONED DOD OBLIGED TO BAIL OUT LOCKHEED):
                            SUBSTANTIALLY HELP DIFFICULT US BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SITUATION, AND SERVE
                            OUR OWN VITAL STRATEGIC INTERESTS IN GULF AND MIDDLE EAST. REPLIED I
                            COULD NOT HONESTLY HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE ON A BREAKTHROUGH ON OIL IN NEAR
                            FUTURE BUT THAT I KNEW WE WOULD DO OUR BEST ON <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT, ALTHOUGH I OBVIOUSLY COULD GIVE NO ASSURANCES
                            TILL LEGISLATION ENACTED AND WE KNEW WHAT WE HAD TO WORK WITH.</p>
                        <p>13. COMMENT:</p>
                        <p>(A) ALTHOUGH SHAH WAS SERIOUS AND AT TIMES EMOTIONAL RE OUR INABLIITY TO
                            HELP HIM MORE WITH THINGS HE FEELS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR IRAN AND FREE WORLD
                            INTERESTS IN GULF, HE WAS FRIENDLY AND AS WE TALKED IT OUT, APPRECIATIVE
                            OF ALL WE ARE DOING AND SEEMED MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS.
                            FROM WHAT HE SAID I THINK HE WILL TAKE A HARD NEW LOOK AT HIS MILITARY
                            ACQUISITION PROBLEM REALIZING WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO BETTER
                            ON <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT. THIS, I BELIEVE, IS MOST
                            IMPORTANT OUTCOME OF TALKS WITH HIM, ALAM AND <gloss target="#t_PMPRIMIN1">PM</gloss>

                        <p>(B) IF HE CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT HE DOES NOT WANT TO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT
                            PIECEMEAL FROM VARIETY OF SOURCES BECAUSE HE FULLY APPRECIATES LOGISTIC,
                            TRAINING AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT WILL RESULT. ON OTHER HAND, HE
                            CLEARLY FEELS THAT HIS PRESENT FORCE—AND EQUIPMENT PROJECTIONS ARE
                            INDISPENSABLE MINIMUM TO ASSURE SECURITY OF HIS COUNTRY AND ITS
                            LIFE-LINE, THE GULF. WHILE I BELIEVE HE MAY CUT BACK A BIT OR POSTPONE
                            ACQUISITION OF SOME ITEMS OF US EQUIPMENT PRESENTLY IN HIS FIVE-YEAR
                            SHOPPING LIST, BELIEVE HE WILL PROBABLY TURN TO WEST EUROPEAN SOURCES
                            FOR AT LEAST SOME ITEMS HE HAD PLANNED BUY FROM US.</p>
                        <p>(C) ALSO BELIEVE HE WILL CONTINUE ACQUIRE FROM SOVIETS NON-SENSITIVE
                            ITEMS SUCH AS VEHICLES AND PROBABLY SOME ARTILLERY (130 MM) ON BARTER
                            BASIS TO CONSERVE HIS FOREIGN EXCHANGE, BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WILL
                            TURN TO THEM FOR SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR HE KNOWS DANGERS AND
                            RECOGNIZES, AS HE SAID TO ME, THAT "RUSSIAN IMPERIALIST AMBITIONS IN THE
                            PERSIAN GULF HAVE NOT CHANGED ONE BIT OVER THE YEARS.”</p>
                        <p>(D) DESPITE MY POURING COLD WATER ON PROSPECT OF OIL BREAKTHROUGH, HE IS
                            STILL "COUNTING ON PRESIDENT" TO DO SOMETHING.</p>

                        <p>On March 17, 1970 the National Security Council Interdepartmental Group
                            for Near East and South Asia (NSCIG/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>)
                            met and decided in favor of extending a Foreign Military Sales credit of
                            approximately $100 million to Iran this year. We intend to implement
                            this decision as soon as <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 Foreign
                            Military Sales authorization and appropriation legislation is enacted
                            and signed.</p>
                        <p>In 1968 the Executive Branch undertook to support Iran's program of
                            military modernization for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 and
                            the ensuing five years by seeking Congressional authority and
                            appropriations for necessary military credits. This undertaking was
                            contingent on an annual review with the Government of Iran of its
                            economic and military situation and requirements. This review has been
                            undertaken by our Ambassador, Chief Armish/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, and their staffs with the Iranian Prime Minister and
                            appropriate members of his government. The aforementioned meeting of the
                                NSCIG/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> considered the results of
                            this review and found that Iran is maintaining a satisfactory rate of
                            economic progress, that it is credit worthy, and that the military items
                            it wishes to obtain with approximately $100 million of credit (primarily
                            F-4's, radar and tank overhaul facilities) are appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The terms of the credit are to be negotiated, but the Interdepartmental
                            Group agreed that the credit should be a mix of direct Foreign Military
                            Sales credit and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> guaranteed private
                            credit in the range of 50-50 to 75 <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            to 25 private credit. It was also agreed that the blend of USG and
                            private interest rates on this credit should result in an overall rate
                            no less than the cost of money to the Treasury at the time the credit is
                            negotiated. The repayment period, to be negotiated, is not to exceed ten
                            years from date of disbursement.</p>

                            MIKJDARY AID TO TURKEY WHOSE VITAL INTERESTS, SHAH BELIEVES, ARE MUCH
                            LESS THREATENED THAN THOSE OF IRAN'S JUGULAR IN GULF. THEREFORE THEY
                            ASK: WHY DO WE NOT HELP IRAN WITH MORE LHN MCREDTI?</p>
                        <p>5. UNLESS A FIND WAY TO BREAK AWAY FROM PRESENT STERILE DIALOGUE IN WHICH
                            SHAH KEEPS SAYING, "WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO HELP ME WHEN IT IS IN YOUR
                            INTEREST TO DO SO?" AND WE REPLY, "SORRY, THOUGH WE AGREE RE IMPORTANCE

                            POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT YOU ASK,” I FEAR WE ARE GOING TO SEE STEADY
                            DETERIORATION IN SPECIAL US-IRAN RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT UP IN
                            RECENT YEARS AND WHICH SERVES OUR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST SO WELL. JUST AS

                        <p>6. IN TWO LONG TALKS I HAD WITH <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">SAMII</persName> OVER PAST SEVERAL DAYS A POSSIBLE WAY OF BREAKING
                            OUT OF PRESENT IMPASSE EMERGED. OUR DISCUSSION CENTERED ON BASIC LIST OF
                            MILITARY EQUIPMENT PREPARED BY GENERAL TWITCHELL AT IRANIAN REQUEST,
                            ENUMERATING ITEMS WHICH IRAN INDICATED IT WOULD LIKE ACQUIRE OVER NEXT
                            FIVE YEARS. THIS LIST OF "TRANCHE CANDIDATES" TOTALS $896 MILLION. SAMII
                            FELT IT POSSIBLE TO PROCURE ELSEWHERE OR ELIMINATE M-60 TANKS; CH-47
                            HELICOPTERS; 175 MM ARTILLERY AND AMMO THUS REDUCING TOTAL BY $136
                            MILLION. THIS WOULD STILL LEAVE $760 MILLION FOR FIVE YEAR PERIOD
                            CONSISTING OF FOUR ADDITIONAL F-4 SQUADRONS FOR 1973-76 PERIOD ($345

                        <p>7. I TOLD <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">SAMII</persName> IT OBVIOUSLY
                            IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT $760 MILLION PROGRAM INTO REMAINING FOUR TRANCHES
                            ($400 MILLION) IN 1968 AGREEMENT. ONLY ANSWER I COULD SEE IS TO KNOCK
                            MORE ITEMS OFF LIST OR STRETCH OUT ACQUISITION OVER SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER
                            PERIOD. I TOLD HIM GEN TWITCHELL AND I HAVE PEJUONAL DOUBTS ABOUT IRAN'S

                            1973-76 PERIOD AT RATE ON ONE EACH YEAR AND SUGGESTED THIS WOULD BE ONE
                            LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR STRETCH OUT.</p>

                            PERSUADE SHAH TO STRETCH OUT PROGRAM OVER PERIOD OF 7 TO 8 YEARS INSTEAD
                            OF PRESENTLY ENVISIONED FIVE YEARS. HE WANTED TO THINK THIS OVER,
                            PARTICULARLY HOW TO APPROACH SHAH WHO IS VERY SENSITIVE AND PRICKLY
                            ABOUT IRAN'S MINIMUM SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. IF DELIVERY SCHEDULE FOR F-4
                            AIRCRAFT WHICH ALONE TOTAL ABOUT $475 MILLION WERE STRETCHED OUT FROM
                            FIVE TO SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS, OVER-ALL PROBLEM WOULD BECOME MORE
                            MANAGEABLE. I REMINDED SAMII THERE IS ONLY $400 MILLION REMAINING IN
                            TRANCHES UNDER 1968 AGREEMENT. HE SAID HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THIS BUT WE
                            SURELY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FOLLOWING SHAH'S TALKS WITH PRESIDENT LAST
                            OCTOBER SHAH COMPLETELY CONFIDENT THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM IN OBTAINING
                            ADDITIONAL $100 MILLION TRANCHES FOR FIFTH YEAR OF HIS PROGRAM AND
                            POSSIBLY SEVERAL ADDITIONAL YEARS SINCE WHAT HE IS DOING IS IMPLEMENTING
                                “<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>” DOCTRINE. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">SAMII</persName> SAID ONLY POSSIBLE WAY HE COULD
                            SEE TO OBTAIN SHAH'S ACQUIESCENCE TO STRETCH OUT WOULD BE BASED ON
                            EXTENSION FOR 3 OR 5 YEARS OF 1968 PROGRAM OF $100 ANNUAL TRANCHES.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION: (A) DESPITE FACT
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> KNOWS THAT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR
                            ADDITIONAL $100 MILLION TRANCHES UNDER 1968 AGREEMENT IT IS CLEAR THAT
                            SHAH IN HIS PROGRAM FOR NEXT FIVE YEARS IS COUNTING ON ADDITIONAL
                            TRANCHE FOR FIFTH AND POSSIBLY SEVERAL SUCCEEDING YEARS. AS PRACTICAL
                            MATTER WE ARE THEREFORE FACED TODAY WITH ISSUE OF EXTENDING 1968
                            AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d57-04" facs="d57-04"/>
                        <p>(B) IN FACE OF THIS SITUATION SHOULD WE REFUSE TO EXTEND <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> CREDIT AFTER EXPIRATION OF 1968
                            AGREEMENT, WE SHOULD HAVE NO RPT NO DOUBT THAT RESULT WILL BE MAJOR
                            CRISIS AND END OF SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP SHAH FEELS FOR US.</p>
                        <p>(C) MY OWN STRONG RECOMMENDATION, CONCURRED IN BY GEN TWITCHELL, IS THAT
                            WE BREAK OUT OF PRESENT IMPASSE, WHICH UNLESS RESOLVED WILL PUT
                            INCREASING STRAINS ON OUR RELATIONS WITH IRAN UNTIL THEY CRACK, BY
                            OFFERING TO EXTEND 1968 AGREEMENT FOR THREE OR FOUR ADDITIONAL YEARS,
                            SUBJECT OF COURSE TO USUAL CONGRESSIONAL CAVEATS. AS PRACTICAL MATTER,
                            THIS WOULD BE MAKING VIRTUE OF WHAT I BELIEVE WILL IN ANY EVENT BE A
                            NECESSITY IF WE ARE TO MAINTAIN OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN,
                            WHICH HAS RESULTED IN SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND FACILITIES FOR US, AND
                            IRAN'S COOPERATION IN MANY OTHER MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO OUR OWN
                            NATIONAL INTEREST. AT SAME TIME EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT WOULD GIVE US
                            TOOL TO TRY TO RESHAPE IRAN'S PROGRAM OF ACQUISITION OF US MILITARY
                            EQUIPMENT ALONG MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE LINES, PARTICULARLY
                            IN FIRST INSTANCE THROUGH A STRETCH-OUT. WE WILL ONLY INFURIATE SHAH IF
                            WE TRY TO TELL HIM BLUNTLY WHAT HE DOES OR DOES NOT NEED BUT IF WE
                            OBTAIN STRETCH OUT WE MAY BE ABLE ALSO TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT MAGNITUDE.
                            WE BELIEVE ONLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO TRY PERSUADE SHAH TO STRETCH OUT HIS
                            FIVE YEAR PROGRAM IS THROUGH EXTENSION OF 1968 AGREEMENT. WITHOUT SUCH
                            ACTION ON OUR PART OR INCREASE IN ANNUAL AMOUNT OF FMS CREDIT WHICH WE
                            CONSIDER LESS DESIRABLE THAN STRETCH-OUT, LONGER TERM PROSPECT FOR OUR
                            RELATIONS WITH IRAN APPEARS BLEAK.</p>
                        <p>10. I REALIZE OF COURSE EXTENSION OF 1968 AGREEMENT WOULD REQUIRE
                            CONGRESSIONAL CONSULTATION; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IN
                            GULF IN TERMS OUR OWN MOST FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS AND FACT PROGRAM
                            INVOLVES LOAN AND NOT RPT NOT GRANT AID, I THINK A VERY SPECIAL CASE CAN
                            BE MADE FOR IRAN. ALL CONGRESSIONAL VISITORS WE HAVE HAD HERE SINCE MY
                            ARRIVAL HAVE, AFTER OUR BRIEFINGS AND TALKS WITH SHAH, BEEN MOST
                            SYMPATHETIC AND HAVE EXPRESSED VIEW THAT WE SHOULD DO ALL WE CAN TO HELP
                            IRAN INCREASE ITS STRENGTH SO IT CAN DEFEND OUR AND OTHER FREE WORLD
                            INTERESTS IN GULF WITHOUT OUR HAVING TO GET INVOLVED.</p>
                        <p>11. IF ABOVE RECOMMENDATION IS ACCEPTED, IT WOULD NOT, OF COURSE, IN ANY
                            WAY AFFECT CONTINUING EFFORTS OF GENERAL TWITCHELL AND MYSELF TO SPUR
                            IRANIAN LEADERSHIP TO MAKE THEIR PROGRAM MATCH BETTER THEIR OVER-ALL
                            RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS REGARDING BOTH MAGNITUDE AND STRETCH-OUT. I
                            SHOULD ADD AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION IS OBVIOUSLY AT HEART OF PROBLEM AND
                            REPRESENTS WELL OVER HALF THE TOTAL OF SHAH'S BASIC FIVE YEAR PROGRAM;
                            AND UNTIL IT IS RESOLVED, PREFERABLY THROUGH STRETCH-OUT, IT IS VERY
                            DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW WE CAN DEAL WITH TOTALITY OF PROBLEM.</p>

                            VERY GOOD, INVOLVING 2 1/2 PER CENT INTEREST OVER LONG TERM (REF B).

                            FMS CREDIT (REF 8 AND C). HE ALSO MADE STRONG PITCH FOR LARGER FMS

                            IRANIAN OIL WHICH WOULD TAKE CARE OF FINANCING. LIKE SHAH (PARA 9, REF
                            B) HE POINTED OUT BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH OFFERING MUCH BETTER CREDIT

                            IMMEDIATELY FOR ABOUT $110,000 PER TANK. HE CONCLUDED BY POINTING OUT
                            AGAIN THAT WHILE SHAH STRONGLY DESIRES TO PROCURE MAJOR ITEMS OF
                            EQUIPMENT FROM US, HE MUST GET IT ELSEWHERE IF WE CANNOT FIND WAYS TO

                            MOTIVE BEHIND THIS SOVIET PRESSURE AND CONTINUING OFFERS OF MILITARY
                            EQUIPMENT ON INCREASINGLY ATTRACTIVE TERMS, IS OF COURSE, CLEAR. IT IS

                            SOVIETS DOUBTLESS BELIEVE, AND WITH GOOD REASON, THAT IF THEY CAN
                            UNDERMINE SPECIAL MILITARY COOPERATION ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN US AND

                            CANNOT ABSOLUTELY EXCLUDE TANKS), FACT REMAINS SOVIET PURPOSE OF ERODING

                            OUT OF IMPASSE WITH SHAH BY OFFERING TO EXTEND 1968 AGREEMENT FOR THREE

                            PROGRAM OF SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS. AT PRESENT SHAH IS DETERMINED TO
                            IMPLEMENT HIS FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE COULD BE
                            PERSUADED TO ACCEPT STRETCH-OUT OF THAT PROGRAM. NOR DOES STRETCH-OUT WE
                            HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PROBLEM WHICH WILL ARISE LATER
                            RE FOLLOW-ON AIRCRAFT FOR F-5'S. LATTER PROBLEM, HOWEVER, CAN ONLY BE
                            FITTED IN TO LONGER-TERM PICTURE WHEN DOD HAS DECIDED ON CHOICE FOR
                            UPCOMING FREEDOM FIGHTER AND THIS CHOICE (PARTICULARLY IF IT WERE F-4-EF
                            AIRCRAFT) COULD AFFECT (PERHAPS HELPFULLY FROM OUR VIEWPOINT) SHAH'S
                            DESIRE TO OBTAIN FOUR ADDITIONAL SQDNS OF F-4S 1973-77. WHETHER OR NOT
                            STRETCH-OUT PROPOSAL WILL PROVE ACCEPTABLE TO SHAH, WE CONTINUE TO
                            RECOMMEND STRONGLY THAT UNDER SECRETARY RICHARDSON BE IN POSITION WHEN
                            HE VISITS TEHRAN APRIL 20- 21 TO EXPLORE THIS POSSIBILITY WITH SHAH IF
                            AT THAT TIME IT SEEMS BEST LINE OF APPROACH. AT BEST MIGHT RESULT IN
                            PREVENTING CRISIS IN OUR RELATIONS WITH SHAH WHICH IN ABSENCE OF SOME
                            NEW UNDERSTANDING WE WILL INEVITABLY FACE. AT WORST—IF UNACCEPTABLE TO
                            SHAH—IT WOULD INDICATED WE ARE DOING OUR BEST, TO HELP HIM WITHIN OUR

                            <item>Letter to You from the Shah of Iran</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Shah has written you another letter (Tab B) in which he makes the
                            following two points:</p>
                        <p>1. No substantial progress has been made on the question of Iran's desire
                            to sell oil to the United States. The Shah reaffirms his intention to
                            use the proceeds from such sales to finance purchases of arms and other
                            equipment in the U.S., a situation which he believes would help our
                            balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>2. The terms of our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 military
                            credit sales program —under which [the Shah is informed] Iran would get
                            50% direct U.S. government credits and 50% government guaranteed private
                            credits— are too stiff. He does not feel that he can come up with 50% of
                            the credits from the private sector without bearing unusually high
                            interest rates.</p>
                        <p>The Shah repeats the familiar rationale in asking for your special
                            consideration on both of these points—that Iran is bearing its own
                            defense burdens while pursuing an unusually high rate of social and
                            economic development. He does not want to compromise on either
                            front.</p>
                        <p>Oil. As you know, there have been essentially two routes to pursue in
                            helping to increase Iran's oil revenues:</p>
                        <p>1. Urging the Western consortium to lift more oil. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> has pressed this forcefully
                            with the companies. The consortium's negotiations with Iran are now
                            going on, and a possible loan is being discussed as an alternative to
                            increased lifting of oil.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d59-02" facs="d59-02"/>
                        <p>2. Increasing U.S. imports. Under the present import system this has not
                            been possible since the government is not in a position to import in
                            quantity for its own purposes and Iran does not qualify for a quota as
                            long as it has no association with an importer with refining
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>It is the latter question that the Shah alludes to briefly in his letter.
                            While pressure on the companies will be maintained, it is not possible
                            to hold out much hope on the point the Shah raises unless we were to get
                            back into the issue of altering import policy.</p>
                        <p>Military credit sales program. The situation here is that, under a
                            five-year memo of understanding dating from 1968, we have budgeted to
                            make available to Iran $100 million in foreign military sales credit for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 as soon as the legislation is
                            enacted and signed. It was estimated that this credit would be provided
                            in the following proportions: 50% U.S. Government credit and 50%
                            Government-guaranteed private credit and it is this information which
                            the Shah had in mind when he wrote you about the difficulty of his
                            obtaining credits from the private sector. However, State and Defense
                            have arranged to make the total credits package available in a range of
                            50-50 to 75-25, with the final proportion to be determined by
                            negotiation. The Shah is not aware of this flexibility and it is
                            therefore possible for you to be forthcoming in your response to him on
                            this point. The interest rate overall would be 7-1/2%, well below
                            commercial rates.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has suggested a longer range response to the
                            Shah's general concerns over credit availability— amending the 1968
                            memorandum of understanding to reach out another three or four years,
                            1973-76. He feels that the Shah might be more relaxed if he could see a
                            way to fit his present military plans into foreseeable credits. A
                            recommendation on this question will be put to you later this month. It
                            is not an issue which you need address in your present letter.</p>
                        <p>Everyone agrees that the U.S. relationship with Iran is important for
                            reasons ranging from our intelligence facilities there to its potential
                            contribution to stability in that part of the world. Iran has received
                            military sales credit at a steady rate of at least $100 million yearly.
                            The Shah, however, is a man understandably in a hurry—as you know— <pb n="3" xml:id="d59-03" facs="d59-03"/>and has persistently pressed
                            our resources and his to their limits. This creates a continuing
                            tension. That tension need not be destructive but does mean that we will
                            constantly have to deal with these pressures from the Shah.</p>
                        <p>For the moment, the attached letter deals with the subject the Shah has
                            raised. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> will be
                            seeing him on April 20 in Tehran and may be in a better position to
                            discuss longer range military credit then.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you sign the letter at Tab A to the Shah. [Mr. Keogh
                            has cleared the text.]</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot</persName>:</p>
                        <p>With reference to our conversation about Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s proposal to extend the
                            1968 credit understanding with Iran to cover the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74 to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            76-77, the Department of Defense does not believe we should submit this
                            proposal to the President at this time. The following are the reasons
                            for this position:</p>
                        <p>1. The Persian Gulf Study, <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 66, is
                            designed to define U.S. policy toward the Persian Gulf area but has not
                            yet been approved by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. The
                            decision made on it could well have a major impact on the armaments we
                            want to supply Iran and the rate at which we will want to supply them.
                            To make an offer to extend our credit commitment without an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision on our overall policy on the
                            Gulf does not appear warranted by the developments in this situation.
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> therefore ' recommends that
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 66 again be placed on the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> agenda as a matter of high
                            priority. (As you know, it had been scheduled for discussion by the
                            Review Group in early April, but has now been slipped to 21 May.) If
                            this is done, it might be possible that an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision could be reached by the time of your
                            discussions with the Shah and you would then be able to discuss his
                            desires in light of this decision. In the absence of such a decision, it
                            is not believed to be in the U.S. interest to limit U.S. policy
                            flexibility towards the Persian Gulf area by a prior commitment which
                            might well impinge on it. </p>
                        <p>2. The Shah is concerned with two major issues: (a) increasing Iranian
                            oil exports to the U.S., and (b) obtaining more than $100 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit over the next several
                            years. While full weight is given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s recommendation, it does
                            not appear certain that this proposed offer would satisfy the Shah as it
                            does not meet either of his two primary demands. If we made this offer
                            and it did not satisfy his requirements, we would then have committed
                            the President without having solved the problem.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d60-02" facs="d60-02"/>
                        <p>3. This does not appear to be a propitious time for the Executive Branch,
                            and particularly the Defense Department, to be making new "commitments"
                            or extending existing ones. While we recognize that the extension of the
                            1968 undertaking is not a binding commitment on the U.S. Government, it
                            does tend to be viewed by Iran as a commitment and in any case does
                            limit the President's flexibility.</p>
                        <p>4. We do not believe it prudent for an incumbent Administration to
                            undertake an obligation which could possibly develop into an encumbrance
                            to future Administrations unless such action is absolutely necessary. It
                            does not appear that this situation requires such an action at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In light of the uncertainty concerning the effect the proposed offer
                            might have on the Shah and the questionable desirability of making such
                            an offer prior to a decision on <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>
                            66, I recommend that we expedite discussion of the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> before submitting a memorandum to the
                            President. I would suggest also that during your audience with the Shah
                            on 20 April, you take the opportunity to further explore the seriousness
                            of this situation and what actions the U.S. could take which would have
                            the highest probability of ameliorating the forecast crisis. Based on
                            your discussions with the Shah and a decision on <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 66, we voUld then be in a better
                            position to make a recommendation to the President.</p>
                        <p>In your discussions with the Shah, we believe it would be useful to
                            reiterate several points which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has recently made. Although the Shah is aware
                            of these facts, it does not appear that he fully recognizes, or is
                            willing to recognize, the special position and consideration Iran has in
                            its military relationship with the U.S. As you are aware, these include
                            the largest <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> outside SEA, almost
                            one-third of our <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit, the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F-4 Technical Assistance Field Team
                                (<gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss>), one-half of all our foreign
                            jet pilot training spaces, and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                            assistance in the M-47 retrofit program. Several of these extend for
                            several years into the future, i.e., there are no plans to elieinate the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, the 1968 credit understanding
                            extends through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973, the <gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss> will be in Iran for at least one year
                            and perhaps longer, and we are committed to train Iranian pilots through
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974. In addition, the Department
                            of Defense is working on providing the best possible credit terms for
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit for Iran and is looking into the possibility of
                            providing additional pilot training in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> opened the
                            conversation by noting that, although he had spoken with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> on the phone about
                            the question of Iran's military requirements, he thought it would be
                            useful to explore the matter in a bit more depth. He was shortly going
                            to be in Iran seeing the Shah and expected that this would be one of the
                            main subjects of conversation. Specifically he wanted to know what
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>'s thoughts were
                            on Iranian capability to absorb the kind of equipment it had in mind in
                            its new five-year acquisition plan.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said he thought
                            the Iranians would have trouble digesting all of the equipment they have
                            in mind in the time frame presently contemplated. He thought that it
                            would be particularly difficult to train enough pilots to man the four
                            additional squadrons of F-4's that were in the plan. There were also
                            maintenance and the training of maintenance personnel problems involved
                            with such a large acquisition in such a short period of time. He noted
                            the pilot problem was aggravated by the fact that Iran requires jet
                            pilots in both seats of its F-4's in contrast to one required in our own
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d61-02" facs="d61-02"/>air force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> asked where these pilots are
                            trained. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> replied
                            that they were trained in the United States and that we had 75 spaces
                            earmarked for Iran for the next two years. He noted that this
                            represented 1/2 of all spaces available for foreign pilots trained in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> then asked whether
                            the stretch-out proposed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> made sense. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that he thought a
                            stretch-out would make more sense from Iran's absorptive capability
                            point of view and it would also make more sense with regard to
                            financing. He noted that the additional squadrons of F-4's by themselves
                            amounted to approximately $362 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> then asked whether
                            Iran needed four additional squadrons of F-4's. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> replied that Iran could
                            probably use two additional squadrons of F-4's and an additional two
                            squadrons of some F-5 follow-on plane such as the P-530 or the modified
                            version of the F-4, the F-4E(F). The Shah could use these better than
                            F-4's in close ground support work. He noted, however, that the Shah has
                            very firm ideas on this subject and it will be very difficult to
                            convince him otherwise. He said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had warned him before seeing the Shah that a
                            "big brother knows it all attitude" simply would not wash with the Shah.
                            He agreed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s judgment.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> moved on to the
                            question of the 36 additional C-130's included in the Shah's plans. He
                            said that the Shah indicated a need for these in order to be able to
                            move a battalion or two to threatened areas. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that in discussing this
                            question with the Shah, without it ever having been stated explicitly,
                            it was clear that what the Shah really had in mind was acquiring a
                            capability to go to Saudi Arabian defense should the need arise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> said that he
                            assumed that should we all agree that it would be a good idea for him to
                            let the Shah know that we were willing to extend our 1968 undertaking
                            for a few more years that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d61-03" facs="d61-03"/>could work out the details with
                            the Shah and his advisors. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> agreed that no special mechanism or mission need
                            be appointed and indeed he doubted that anyone would be as competent as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> in this
                            undertaking. He said that he felt the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Tehran was one of the best in the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> inquired about
                            possible alternatives the Shah had and the problems that the exercise of
                            these alternatives might give him. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> replied that he thought there were a number of
                            factors that favored the Shah's desire to continue to get equipment from
                            the U.S. even though it was more expensive and perhaps not on as
                            favorable terms as elsewhere. Paramount was the Shah's feeling of
                            special relations with the US, which he considered the leader of the
                            free world. This was a most important and valuable psychological factor
                            in the Shah's thinking. Secondly, American equipment is familiar to the
                            Shah and the Iranian armed forces and they are organized to use and
                            maintain U.S. equipment. A shift to other suppliers would of course
                            involve the establishment of a second source of supply with different
                            standards, maintenance requirements, training requirements, technicians,
                            etc. Should the Soviet Union be considered a source for sophisticated
                            equipment it would mean the introduction of Soviet military technicians
                            into Iran, something which the Shah did not want. In the case of the
                            French it has been other people's experience that while the French are
                            pretty good on delivering the original item they are difficult and slow
                            when it comes to spares. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt that the Shah was well aware of all these
                            factors and gave them serious weight in thinking about alternatives. In
                            the end, however, the Shah was determined to provide for his security as
                            best he could and we could not rule out completely the possibility of
                            his turning elsewhere if he were seriously frustrated in his dealings
                            with us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> turned to the
                            question of <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>-66 and the fact that
                            it had not yet been run all the way through the executive machinery. He
                            said that he knows this concerns <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Warren
                                Nutter</persName>. On the other hand, he believes that a reading of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>-66 clearly points in the
                            direction of the conclusion that we have no real option but to bank on
                            Iran. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> agreed,
                            noting there was no one else in the area. <pb n="4" xml:id="d61-04" facs="d61-04"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>
                            went on to note that there were of course some other considerations in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>-66 such as our relations with
                            the Trucial States in the post-1971 period which needed to be considered
                            but that this in no way affected the fundamental proposition that our
                            best bet was with Iran and encouraging cooperation among the Persian
                            Gulf states. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said
                            that he believed the Iranians and Saudis were already making good
                            progress toward cooperation. They both shared the view that the Persian
                            Gulf was vital to their interests and that Communist and radical Arab
                            influence should be kept out of the area. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt this was a powerful
                            incentive to further cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> then noted that he
                            was also going to have to face the oil question with the Shah. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> remarked that the
                            Shah simply does not understand why we cannot help him out in this
                            regard and he probably never will understand. He says the Shah views
                            this as a straightforward proposition which has obvious advantages to
                            the U.S. We buy more oil from him which helps him with his security
                            purchases and he in turn undertakes to guarantee that every penny of the
                            proceeds will be spent in the United States which helps out our balance
                            of payments. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said
                            that the Shah decried large liftings of oils in the Persian Gulf area
                            and singled out Kuwait specifically for criticism. He said the Kuwaitis
                            had over 900 million pounds deposited in London banks that they don't
                            know what to do with. He said the absurdity of the situation was
                            illustrated by a report he had heard that the Kuwaitis were even
                            considering air conditioning the streets of downtown Kuwait.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> concluded the
                            meeting with his observation that he believed that he needed to have
                            something in hand when he met with the Shah. He very much appreciated
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>'s views on this
                            subject and was pleased to note that they coincided with his own. He
                            said that he would be in further touch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> of his support.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Shah of Iran, as you know, has been pressing to increase his
                            financial resources on two fronts: (1) additional sales of Iranian oil
                            to the U.S. and (2) additional U.S. credit for purchase of U.S. military
                            equipment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            believes we are headed for some sort of crisis with him if we cannot
                            give him a little more financial flexibility.</p>
                        <p>The present U.S. military sales credit program for Iran is based on a
                            U.S. -Iranian Memorandum of Understanding signed in June 1968. The U.S.
                            Executive Branch undertook to provide Iran through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973 with $100 million credit yearly,
                            contingent on annual Congressional authority and appropriations and on
                            yearly reviews of Iran's military programs and financial position. $200
                            million have already been provided, and this year's $100 million is
                            ready to go once Congress has passed the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 sales legislation.</p>
                        <p>The present problem stems from the fact that Iran has a five-year
                            program, FY 1970 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974, to
                            procure military equipment from the U.S., which if carried out
                            completely would cost $896 million at current prices, or a level of
                            about $180 million yearly. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> believes that some items will drop from this
                            list as the Iranians sort out their priorities, bringing the total down
                            to perhaps $760 million, or about $150 million yearly.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador's proposal, endorsed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and the Defense Department, is
                            to try to lengthen the period in which this equipment is to be purchased
                            by 3 or 4 years. This would require our extending the 1968 Memorandum of
                            Understanding, which now will run out in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973, to run at least through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1976. This is not technically a commitment; it is an
                            Executive Branch promise to seek $100 million yearly from the Congress.
                            Lengthening the period would <pb n="2" xml:id="d62-02" facs="d62-02"/>permit us to stay around the $100 million level which has been the
                            basis of our presentations to Congress.</p>
                        <p>The alternative, of course, would be to try to increase our military
                            credit closer to $150 million through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1973 than to the present level of $100 million.</p>
                        <p>The arguments for staying near the present $100 million level but
                            extending the period if we can are:</p>
                        <p>—The present level of $100 million for Iran is about 30% of the total
                            $350 million Foreign Military Sales Program proposed to the Congress.
                            Iran is the largest recipient. For the sake of comparison, Israel is
                            next with $75 million from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970
                            appropriations (the remainder of the recent package will be funded early
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971); Taiwan has received $40
                            million; Greece is scheduled for S40 million; Latin America is slated
                            for $48 million; and the rest is a collection of smaller programs.</p>
                        <p>—Increasing Iran's share would mean subtracting from what other countries
                            receive or seeking a supplemental appropriation. Recently approved
                            increases in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 Israeli program
                            at the expense of other programs rule out additional funds for Iran in
                            1970 in the absence of a supplemental appropriation. Conceivably an
                            additional $25 million could be allocated to Iran in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 under the current budget request if
                            private credit were utilized, but this would remove the cushion for a
                            potential response to additional Israeli credit requests. Budget Bureau
                            staff advises me that the Bureau would not consider a supplemental
                            appropriation desirable or feasible in view of congressional attitudes
                            and budgetary pressures. A supplemental would require both authorization
                            and appropriation action. Congress has not yet passed the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 Foreign Military Sales Act; the
                            House-passed bill is pending in the Senate. Although we expect Congress
                            to provide the amount requested, a request for additional funds for arms
                            sales would probably be poorly received.</p>
                        <p>—The limitation on the Iranian side is keeping Iran's debt burden within
                            safe limits. In addition to cash purchases from the U.S. of another $150
                            million, Iran in the past four years has bought $300 <pb n="3" xml:id="d62-03" facs="d62-03"/>million for hard currency from other
                            countries. These credits have to 'be repaid. While 'both the World Bank
                            and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> judge Iran as creditworthy
                            now, its debt service costs are already high. It is difficult, of
                            course, to say what is too high; what can be said is that the level now
                            is high enough to be cause for concern in Iran as well as here about
                            raising it much higher.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, there is room to question whether the direct military threat to
                            Iran from the Persian Gulf is as great as the Shah fears. This is not to
                            say that there will not be political instability or that he should not
                            build a strong military force. It does raise question as to whether the
                            threat is growing so rapidly and effectively as to require rates of
                            expenditure even higher than those with which we are now cooperating.
                            The arguments for increasing the level somewhat are:</p>
                        <p>—The Shah's Iran is an island of stability in an otherwise unstable area
                            which includes not only the broader Middle East but also the Persian
                            Gulf from which the British will withdraw next year.</p>
                        <p>—The Shah's foreign policy, while increasingly flexible, is openly based
                            on a special relationship with the U.S. From our viewpoint, he is a good
                            friend.</p>
                        <p>—We have important intelligence facilities in Iran which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> writes [text not
                            declassified]</p>
                        <p>—Given the above factors and Iran's rapid economic growth, there seems
                            little reason not to give the Shah whatever he wants.</p>
                        <p>The question, then, is mainly one of helping a friend as much as possible
                            within restraints imposed by resources on both sides. No one argues
                            against helping the Shah to the extent we are now. The problem arises as
                            he pushes the limits of his resources and ours. He is understandably a
                            man in a hurry who will press all resources available to their limits.
                            The diplomatic problem here is to explain what our limits are and to see
                            whether we can be helpful by making adjustments in the program that will
                            not exceed our budgetary limits. <pb n="4" xml:id="d62-04" facs="d62-04"/>The Secretary's and the Ambassador's recommendation is to see
                            initially whether we can help by extending our present Memorandum of
                            Understanding. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName>,
                            if you approve, -would tell the Shah next Monday that we are prepared to
                            discuss this. If the Shah seems satisfied, we would proceed. If not,
                            then we would need to have a more systematic look at whether a little
                            higher level can be drawn out of the presently planned program. Bill

                        <p>A number of policy decisions affecting U.S.-Iranian relations are now
                            before our Government. Some involve military sales and assistance
                            requests. Some are concerned with oil — both our import policy and the
                            pressures we can bring to bear on the companies controlling the Iranian
                            Consortium. An NSCIG paper on "Future U.S. Policy in the Persian Gulf"
                            which raises the whole question of long-range U.S. policy toward Iran
                            has gone to the Review Group on its way to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is the Shah's contention that because of U.S. interest in the
                            independence and prosperity of Iran, and in keeping both Iran and the
                            Persian Gulf outside the zone of Soviet domination, we should accord an
                            exceptional priority to meeting his requests for help and cooperation.
                            Unless we accept the basic validity of his contention, it is easy for us
                            to reject each of his proposals, one by one, on grounds of cost, lack of
                            urgency, limited capability, undesirable precedent and other arguments.
                            I believe, however, that it is in our own interest to support this
                            concept of a special relationship with Iran; and as Director of Central
                            Intelligence I have a particular responsibility to point out that
                            continuing <pb n="2" xml:id="d63-02" facs="d63-02"/>close U.S.-Iranian
                            ties are essential in order to ensure the receipt of information which
                            is most vital to our national security.</p>
                        <p>Almost all appropriately classified papers dealing with U.S. policy
                            toward Iran mention the "intelligence facilities" situated there as an
                            important factor affecting our decisions. In some ways it is unfortunate
                            that even at rather high inter-agency levels we can not permit a
                            reasonably complete statement of the accomplishments of these
                            facilities, but this is a subject which honestly deserves maximum
                            security protection. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is aware
                            of the existence and at least the general nature of our intelligence
                            collection sensors in Iran, but we believe they have no accurate idea of
                            the reliability and sophistication of the detailed information they
                            provide us.</p>
                        <p>To you and a very few others I can say that the [text not declassified]
                            collection activities in Iran [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] Ruling out Afghanistan as politically infeasible,
                            there is no place to which we could transfer these activities were Iran
                            denied us. In time we hope that some of the important coverage now
                            obtained from Iran can be picked up by overhead sensors, but for some
                            years ahead the ground-based facilities will remain absolutely essential
                            if we are to keep our knowledge of the Soviet programs up to date.</p>
                        <p>The [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] installations in Iran
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] are entirely
                            dependent upon the continuing willingness of the Shah to permit them to
                            operate and to transmit promptly the information they collect. As you
                            consider both our general policy toward Iran, and also the action to be
                            taken on the Shah's requests for assistance, I urge you to accord great
                            importance to our need to continue utilizing Iran as a base for the
                            collection of highest priority intelligence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                            TALK WITH SHAH (IRAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT PROGRAM—UNDER SECRETARY, ASST
                            SECY SISCO AND AMBASSADOR PRESENT)</p>
                        <p>1. SHAH OPENED BY DESCRIBING HIS DEVELOPMENT PLANS, PARTICULARLY FOR
                            KHUZISTAN PROVENCE, POINTING OUT ITS GREAT POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF OIL,
                            NATURAL GAS AND AGRI-BUSINESS. HE HOPED TO INTEREST JAMES LINEN'S
                            BANKING AND INDUSTRIAL GROUP IN DEVELOPMENT OF AGRI-BUSINESS AND RELATED
                            ACTIVITIES DURING LINEN'S VISIT IN MAY. HE POINTED OUT KHUZISTAN STILL
                            COVETED BY IRAQ AND ARAB RADICALS WHO REFER TO IT AS "ARABISTAN" AND
                            CALL FOR ITS LIBERATION.</p>
                        <p>2. HE THEN DESCRIBED IN SOME DETAIL THREAT TO GULF POSED BY RADICAL ARABS
                            WITH SOVIET AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT AND FACT THAT BURDEN OF DEFENSE OF
                            PEACE AND STABILITY IN GULF FALLS ENTIRELY ON IRAN. WHILE HE AND KING
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> SAW EYE TO EYE RE
                            THREAT, SAUDI ARABIA COULD CONTRIBUTE LITTLE MATERIAL STRENGTH TO
                            DEFENSE OF GULF AND INDEED IT WAS UP TO IRAN TO EXTEND AID TO FAISAL
                            WHICH SHAH WOULD CERTAINLY DO. AS TO REMAINING MODERATE GULF STATES,
                            KUWAIT VACILLATED BACK AND FORTH IN ITS EFFORTS TO APPEASE IRAQ AND
                            SMALLER SHEIKHDOMS WOULD ADD NOTHING TO DEFENSE OF GULF.</p>
                        <p>3. THIS, SHAW SAID, WAS WHY IRAN MUST URGENTLY DEVELOP AND STRENGTHEN ITS
                            FORCES. FORCES HE PLANNED WERE MODEST GIVEN NATURE OF THREAT. FOR
                            EXAMPLE, HE WOULD GO WITH M-47 <pb n="2" xml:id="d64-02" facs="d64-02"/>TANK RETROFIT PROGRAM FOR NEXT FEW YEARS INSTEAD OF AT SAME TIME
                            TRYING TO ACQUIRE FOLLOW-ON TANKS FOR M-47's. THIS WOULD SAVE MUCH MONEY
                            AND IN FEW YEARS HE MIGHT ACQUIRE FOLLOW-ON TANK, PERHAPS FROM BRITISH
                            OR EVEN BY IRANIAN PRODUCTION FROM EXPANDED RETROFIT FACILITY. AT SAME
                            TIME TO MINIMIZE SIZE OF HIS GROUND FORCES HE PLANNED TO MAINTAIN ONLY
                            TERRITORIALL TROOPS ON PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN BORDERS AND SMALL
                            REGULAR FORCES ALONG SOVIET FRONTIER. EVEN SO, IRAQ WOULD STILL
                            OUTNUMBER HIS SIX DIVISIONS AND HIS AIR FORCE AND, IF SYRIAN AIR FORCE
                            ADDED TO THAT OF IRAQ, HE WOULD BE GREATLY OUTNUMBERED IN THE AIR. THIS
                            WAS WHY HE MUST HAVE MINIMUM AIR FORCE BUILDUP HE ENVISAGED: NAMELY, TWO
                            SQDNS OF F-4 IN 1971: 4 ADDITIONAL SQDNS OF F-4 IN 1973-76: AND
                            ADDITIONAL C-130'S FOR NECESSARY MOBILITY AND PARATROOP AND AIRBORN
                            CAPABILITY FOR DEFENSE OF GULF AREA, SHAH THEN SAID HE MUST KNOW EXACTLY
                            WHERE HE STOOD WITH US ON CREDIT FOR MILITARY EQUIPMENT. HE WOULD LIKE
                            TO OBTAIN MOST OF HIS EQUIPMENT FROM US BUT FINANCING WAS VERY DIFFICULY
                            PARTICULARLY SINCE IN ADDITION TO MILITARY PROGRAM HE MUST KEEP ON WITH
                            HIS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THIS IS WHY HE HAD OFFERED
                            TO TIE ALL PROCEEDS FROM ADDITIONAL OIL SALES IN US TO PURCHASE OF
                            AMERICAN MILITARY AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE
                            DID NOT ACCEPT THIS OFFER BECAUSE, INSOFAR AS OTHER OIL PRODUCING STATES
                            ARE CONCERNED, WE HAD PERFECT JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING SO SINCE HIS OFFER
                            WAS UNIQUE. THIS WOULD ENABLE HIM TO PAY IN GOOD AMERICAN DOLLARS FOR
                            MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND FMS CREDIT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. IF WE COULD
                            NOT FIND WAYS TO COOPERATE IN FINANCING HIS OVER-ALL MILITARY PROGRAM
                            DESIGNED TO DEFEND IRAN AND FREE WORLD INTERESTS IN GULF, HE WOULD HAVE
                            TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR MUCH OF HIS EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, HE DID WANT TO
                            KEEP HIS AIR FORCE COMPLETELY EQUIPPED WITH AMERICAN AIRCRAFT AND
                            BACK-UP ITEMS. BECAUSE MULTIPLE SOURCES WOULD CREATE IMPOSSIBLE
                            LOGISTICS, MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING PROBLEMS. THEREFORE HE MUST KNOW
                            SOONEST EXACTLY WHAT WHAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DO RE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS
                            FOR HIS MILITARY PROGRAM, PARTICULARLY HIS AIR BUILD-UP, INCLUDING

                        <p>4. UNDER SECRETARY SAID WE FULLY APPRECIATE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION IRAN CAN

                            DIFFICULTIES RE SHAH'S OIL PROPOSAL, BUT SAID WE WOULD KEEP LOOKING TO
                            SEE WHAT WE COULD DO FOR IRAN ON OIL. INSOFAR AS FINANCING MILITARY
                            EQUIPMENT CONCERNED, HE ASSURED SHAH OF OUR EARNEST DESIRE TO DO
                            EVERYTHING WE COULD WITHIN CONGRESSIONAL LIMITATIONS. ACCORDINGLY WE
                            WERE READY TO EXAMINE WITH SHAH HIS MILITARY REQUIREMENTS WITH VIEW TO
                            EXTENDING 1968 AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE FOR ACQUISITION OF EQUIPMENT NOT

                        </list>
                        <p>You may have noted in the New York Times or from other sources that the
                            Iranians and the oil Consortium have reached a satisfactory settlement.
                            In case not, I want to be sure you see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s report. According to him,
                            the terms of the settlement include:</p>
                        <p>—The Consortium will try to achieve total revenues for Iran of $1,030
                            million this year.</p>
                        <p>—In addition, the companies will make an initial advance of $90 million
                            and will advance another $40-45 million later if necessary. Iran,
                            however, by the end of the year will pay back last year's advance of $83
                            million.</p>
                        <p>—The French Company agreed to provide an unspecified amount of oil
                            directly to the Iranians to market themselves.</p>
                        <p>—The companies will try to find a loan for Iran of $100 million from
                            European banks before the end of May.</p>
                        <p>Despite some tense moments, this year's settlement was accomplished
                            without the melodrama and extreme tensions of some past negotiations and
                            we can be thankful for that. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> feels that this was in part due to the fact
                            that the Iranians acted in a more responsible and realistic manner this
                            year. The companies, however, also worked in a more flexible manner this
                            year to bridge the gap between their capabilities and Iran's
                            requirements. I would like to think that this was due to your efforts
                            with them.</p>

                            know, we will have the same problem next year and it might be helpful to
                            add a note of hope that they will be prepared to act with comparable
                            flexibility next year.</p>

                        <p>Following is the information you requested on Iran <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit:</p>
                        <p>1. From <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69, Iran received $500 million in credit
                            to purchase military equipment. Iran's principal and interest repayments
                            during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 will amount to approximately
                            $38.0 million, of which $18.7 million is due between 30 April - 30 June
                            1970. Iran has never defaulted on its repayment obligations.</p>
                        <p>2. You may recall that there have been two letters exchanged between the
                            President and the Shah concerning <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit for Iran. The President in his 16 April 1970 letter told the Shah
                            that the US will "make every effort to reach a satisfactory agreement
                            with your representatives. We will be as forthcoming as is possible in
                            meeting your concerns about the terms of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 credit.”</p>
                        <p>Following the delivery of this letter to the Shah, Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, in his audience
                            with the Shah on 20 April 1970, expressed his "earnest desire to do
                            everything…within Congressional limitations" to help Iran in future
                            credit years (specifically, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1974-77).</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>
                            promised that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is ready to
                            examine with the Shah his military requirements "with a view to
                            extending the 1968 agreement to provide for acquisition of equipment not
                            presently envisioned under that agreement.” This agreement by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> was coordinated
                            with the Department of Defense, and after lengthy negotiations between
                            State and Defense, this version of the statement was finally achieved.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> also expressed to
                            the Iranian Prime Minister his belief that there is a need for a careful
                            task force study of Iran's future defense needs, and to this end Chief
                            AMISH <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the head of the Iranian
                            defense industries will be meeting in preliminary discussions.</p>
                        <p>3. Status of the Iranian <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 credit
                            program is as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. On 17 March 1970 the NSCIG/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                            decided, and the White House has been informed, that the mix of
                            Government and private interest rates on this credit should result in an
                            overall rate of not less than the cost of money to the US Treasury at
                            the time the credit is negotiated. There was also a consensus that the
                            overall interest rate should not exceed substantially the cost of money
                            to the US Treasury.</p>

                        <p>b. During hearings before the <gloss target="#t_HFAC1">HFAC</gloss> on
                            the <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> Act on 5 February and 17
                            February, and on 11 March before Chairman Passman's Appropriations
                            Committee, you, as well as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> and General Warren, in response to specific
                            questions relating to the rate of interest charged on credit funds (NOA)
                            being requested from the Congress, replied that we will charge interest
                            rates equal to the prevailing cost of money to the Government. Although
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> noted to the <gloss target="#t_HFAC1">HFAC</gloss> that we could grant "special interest
                            rates,” he went on to say "we have adhered rather strictly to the policy
                            of requiring interest on these credit sales at the current cost of
                            money.” In a response to Fulbright Committee questions on rates of
                            interest for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70, we provided a table
                            listing the credit terms which showed that interest rates for all
                            countries would be at the current cost of money to the US Treasury
                            (prevailing rate is 7-1/8%).</p>
                        <p>c. We believe that all three Committee Chairmen, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_MTE1">Morgan</persName>, Fulbrigbt and Passman, are
                            convinced that we will not grant concessionary terms on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 and 71 Government-appropriated <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit funds. Chairman Passman is
                            particularly sensitive on the subject of concessionary rates and in
                            reply to your statement that we charge the prevailing cost of money to
                            the US Government stated, "I want to commend you for your program of
                            short terms and the interest rate that you are charging the countries
                            that borrow.”</p>
                        <p>d. Section 34 of the <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> Act empowers the
                            President to establish "standards and criteria for credit and guaranty
                            transactions…in accordance with the foreign, national security and
                            financial policies of the United States.” The present standards and
                            criteria established in February 1969, and reviewed by the National
                            Security Council, apply to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70
                            credit program. These provide that for those transactions in which
                            direct Defense Department credit is combined with private credit, the
                            interest rate on the Defense credit will be such that the rate for the
                            combined package is not less than the cost of money to the US
                            Government. To implement this policy, Treasury has determined that a
                            combination private/public credit could include the US Government
                            portion at not less than 6% interest to balance off the higher private
                            interest rate, provided that the effective or combination rate is not
                            lower than the current cost of money to the US Treasury. This is not
                            concessionary credit, but if the effective rate is less than cost of
                            money, or if the US Government portion is less than 6%, this would
                            constitute "concessionary" credit. We believe that the Congress does not
                            fully understand this definition of concessionary credit.</p>
                        <p>e. We are presently coordinating an updated "Financial Standards and
                            Criteria for Foreign Military Sales" which will be more explicit and
                            clarify our authority to provide for a lower interest rate on the public
                            portion of a mixed public/private credit agreement. The Financial
                            Standards and Criteria also provide that if there are overriding US
                            national interests, concessionary credit, as defined above, may be
                            used.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d66-03" facs="d66-03"/>
                        <p>f. If we are to achieve the $350 million <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 credit program, we must utilize $100 million of
                            private financing. Since we have told Iran that we would undertake to
                            provide $100 million in <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70, and since this is such a
                            significant proportion of the total <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70
                            program, private participation in the Iranian program is essential. The
                            specific mix of Government/private financing and interest rates on each
                            portion is subject to final negotiation. Preliminary discussions with
                            private banks on the basis of a 50/50 or 75/25 mix for Iran indicate
                            that the private rate will be between 8-1/2 - 8-3/4%. Assuming a 50/50
                            mix, and in order to achieve a net rate at the prevailing 7-1/8% cost of
                            money, the rate on the Government portion would have to be approximately
                            6-3/8%. Over the 10-year loan period this means that, to quote Chairman
                            Passman, "the US Government would be subsidizing" Iran for approximately
                            $2.0 million. If the same policy is followed for the proposed $100
                            million <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 Iranian program, and
                            assuming that the prevailing rate of interest remains approximately the
                            same, the Congress will probably claim that we also will be subsidizing
                            Iran at the same rate in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71. Chairman
                            Passman would view such "concessionary rates" as a "$4 million giveaway
                            program" and would violently oppose it.</p>
                        <p>4. It is doubtful that we will obtain final legislation on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 program before mid-June which will
                            leave little time to consummate approximately $280 million in agreements
                            with fifteen countries. We therefore intend to seek State approval for
                            the DOD to proceed with preliminary discussions with selected countries
                            and private banks in order to reach maximum possible agreement prior to
                            passage of the <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> Act. Subject to State
                            agreement, it is also intended that State, assisted by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and Treasury, will notify selected
                            members of Congress of the terms of the final credit agreements in those
                            instances where the interest on the public funds is less than the cost
                            of money to the US Treasury. At the same time, the provisions of the
                            Financial Standards and Criteria will be explained in detail. This will
                            be done only after passage of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> has sent you the
                            attached memorandum on his recent audience with the Shah while he was in
                            Tehran for meetings of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                            military committee. The Shah was "friendly and courteous" but at the
                            same time was "serious and grave.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> feels that the
                            Shah is deeply concerned about the security situation in the region
                            after the British withdrawal. The following are some of the main points
                            made by the Shah in this connection:</p>
                        <p>—The Persian Gulf is Iran's lifeline and Free World control of it is also
                            a strategic necessity because of the oil.</p>
                        <p>—He anticipates that the Soviets will, after the British withdrawal,
                            attempt to stir up mischief in the smaller Gulf states. To counter this,
                            Iran must support, and have the support of, the conservative Arab
                            regimes in the area.</p>
                        <p>—Iran must have the military capability to defend its borders and the
                            Persian Gulf. His program calls for improvements of all elements of
                            Iran's armed forces and especially the air force.</p>
                        <p>—To meet his programs he must have more resources, either from increased
                            sales of oil and/or from credit. The Shah appeared "rather bitter" about
                            the attitude of the oil consortium. Also he feels that the U.S. should
                            buy more Iranian oil, conserving our own reserves. He would then spend
                            every dollar in the U.S. on military equipment and other purchases. <pb n="2" xml:id="d67-02" facs="d67-02"/>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> concludes that the Shah "is
                            determined to create the military forces which he is convinced the
                            security of Iran requires.” He wants to buy the necessary equipment from
                            us, "but he will get it elsewhere, reluctantly, if he has to do so.”</p>
                        <p>Comment: The Shah continues to play hard on the same themes in all his
                            contacts with us. He seems in fact to be testing the limits of our
                            capacity to help</p>

                                Hermann F. Eilts observed that the Arab and Iranian sides both had
                                to be considered in the dispute, which involved the sovereignty
                                claims of the sheikdoms of Sharja and Ras Al-Khaimah to the islands
                                of Tunbs and Abu Musa at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Noting that
                                Abu Musa was inhabited by Arabs, he added that "with deep respect,
                                however, I find it just a bit difficult to accept suggestion that
                                Iran's vital security and ‘even survival' may depend on possessing
                                these islands. While appreciating Iran's potential for stabilizing
                                Gulf, we and Iran should also bear in mind that this is best
                                achieved through sincere cooperation with Arab littoral states.”

                        <p>1. AM DEEPLY DISTURBED BY VARIOUS TELEGRAMS WE HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED
                            FROM LONDON AND DEPARTMENT INDICATING BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE HAS DECIDED
                            TO PROCEED DOWN PATH OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION BETWEEN SHARJA AND
                            UMM-AL-QAIWAIN WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTED WATERS OFF ABU MUSA. TO PROCEED
                            DOWN THIS PATH AT THIS TIME WILL, WE BELIEVE, PUT BRITAIN AND IRAN ON A
                            HEAD-ON COLLISION COURSE — A COURSE WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY OBLIGE US TO
                            SIDE EITHER WITH BRITAIN, WHICH IS WITHDRAWING FROM GULF AND WILL HAVE
                            PROGRESSIVELY LESS INFLUENCE THERE, OR IRAN, WHICH HOLDS BEST HOPE OF
                            PEACE <pb n="2" xml:id="d68-02" facs="d68-02"/>AND STABILITY IN GULF AND
                            PREVENTION OF EXTENSION OF RADICAL ARAB-SOVIET INFLUENCE INTO THAT
                            VITALLY IMPORTANT BODY OF WATER.</p>
                        <p>2. PROBLEM IN SIMPLE TERMS IS THAT, IN OUR BEST JUDGMENT, IRAN HAS NOT
                            AND WILL NOT RENOUNCE ITS CLAIMS TO THREE SMALL ISLANDS IN GULF (THE
                            TUNBS AND ABU MUSA) WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VITAL TO ITS NATIONAL SECURITY
                            — ISLANDS WHICH BRITAIN SEIZED BY FORCE IN LAST CENTURY AND NOW FOR ITS
                            OWN CONVENIENCE DESIRES TO DISPOSE OF, HANDLING PROBLEMS INHERENT IN
                            RELINQUISHMENT IN A WAY WHICH WILL JUSTIFY ITS ORIGINAL ACT OF SEIZURE
                            AND ALLOCATION TO RESPECTIVE SHEIKHDOMS.</p>
                        <p>3. WE BELIEVE SHAH WILL REGARD AS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND REACT VERY
                            STRONGLY AGAINST A BRITISH PROPOSAL FOR ARBITRATION BETWEEN TWO OF ITS
                            PROTECTORATES (SOON TO BE INDEPENDENT) OVER ISLAND WATER (ABU MUSA)
                            WHICH BRITISH KNOW IRAN CLAIMS BECAUSE SUCH ARBITRATION NOT ONLY
                            DISREGARDS IRAN'S HISTORIC CLAIMS AND OFT-STRESSED-SECURITY INTEREST IN
                            ABU MUSA BUT ALSO REINFORCES SHARJA'S CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTY. IF
                            ARBITRATION PROPOSAL IS IMPLEMENTED, EITHER IRANIAN ACQUIESCENCE OR
                            ACCEPTANCE WOULD AMOUNT TO ADMISSION BY IRAN THAT SOVEREIGNTY OVER ABU
                            MUSA RESTS ELSEWHERE. SIMILARLY, WE DO NOT RPT NOT BELIEVE THAT SHAH
                            WOULD ACCEPT PROPOSAL FOR SOME FORM OF ARBITRATION INVOLVING TWO
                            SHEIKHDOMS AND IRAN WHILE ARBITRATION OFTEN USEFUL IN DISPUTE OF LEGAL
                            NATURE, IT IS NON-STARTER IN THIS DISPUTE WHICH IS TERRITORIAL AND
                            THEREFORE HIGHLY POLITICAL INVOLVING WHAT IRAN CONSIDERS ITS MOST VITAL
                            SECURITY INTERESTS. ACCEPTANCE OF ARBITRATION BY IRAN WOULD BE TACIT
                            ACCEPTANCE THAT ITS CLAIMS TO ABU MUSA ARE OPEN TO QUESTION, ADMISSION
                            WE DO NOT BELIEVE SHAH WILL MAKE IN VIEW OF FACT HE REGARDS CONTROL OF
                            TUNBS AND ABU MUSA AS VITAL TO IRAN'S SECURITY, PARTICULARLY SHOULD ARAB
                            SIDE OF GULF FALL TO RADICAL ARAB-SOVIET SUBVERSION.</p>
                        <p>4. WE BELIEVE BRITISH AMB DENIS WRIGHT AND UK EMBASSY HERE ARE AWARE OF
                            REALITIES OF GULF SITUATION (REF A). WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AT THIS
                            JUNCTURE BEST HOPE OF A SOLUTION WHICH WOULD NOT CREATE A MAJOR CRISIS
                            IN GULF BETWEEN IRAN, SHEIKHDOMS AND <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            LIES IN AN IRAN-SHARJA SETTLEMENT WHERE NEITHER PARTY WOULD BE OBLIGED
                            TO REAFFIRM OR RENOUNCE ITS SOVEREIGNTY AS SUGGESTED IN REF A. HOWEVER,
                            MESSAGES FROM <pb n="3" xml:id="d68-03" facs="d68-03"/>LONDON AND
                            INDICATIONS GIVEN TO DEPT BY <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> COUNSELOR
                            MOBERLY LEAD US TO CONCLUSION THAT CERTAiN ELEMENTS IN UK FOREIGN OFFICE
                            LACK UNDERSTANDING OF (A) THE INTENSITY OF IRAN'S FEELING AND (B) THE
                            REALITIES OF WHAT WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN IF BRITISH INITIATE THEIR
                            ARBITRATION PLAN NOW (RPT NOW) INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR IRAN TO REACH
                            AGREEMENT WITH SHARJA OVER ABU MUSA. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT DISCUSSIONS
                            BETWEEN ABU MUSA AND IRAN SHOULD NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF
                            SHARJA-UMM-AL-QAIWAN TERRITORIAL WATERS PROBLEM. BUT THIS SHOULD
                            INITIALLY BE DEALT WITH IN CONTEXT OF IRAN-SHARJA AND THEN
                            IRAN-UMM-AL-QAIWAIN NEGOTIATIONS AND NOT BY ACTIVATION BRITISH PROPOSAL
                            FOR ARBITRATION BETWEEN TWO SHEIKHDOMS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL "TEAR"
                            IT.</p>
                        <p>5. IF BRITISH SHOULD PROCEED WITH THEIR ARBITRATION PROPOSAL, WE MUST BE
                            PREPARED NOT ONLY FOR SHAH'S VERY STRONG REACTION AGAINST SHEIKHDOMS AND
                            BRITISH BUT ALSO FOR A REQUEST FROM HIM FOR US TO SUPPORT HIS POSITION.
                            WHILE WE SHOULD TRY TO STAY OUT OF THIS DISPUTE, IF BRITISH MOVE FORWARD
                            WITH ARBITRATION WE DOUBT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO. ZAHEDI HAS ALREADY
                            TOLD US (IN HIS TALK WITH SISCO MAY 14, STATE'S 075064) IRAN IS COUNTING
                            ON US SUPPORT FOR ITS CLAIMS TO DISPUTED GULF ISLANDS. IF, AS SEEMS MOST
                            PROBABLE, SHAH SEEKS OUR SUPPORT OF HIS POSITION HE WILL REGARD OUR <pb n="4" xml:id="d68-04" facs="d68-04"/>RESPONSE AS MEASURE OF WHAT
                            FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH US IS WORTH ON MATTER ON WHICH HE
                            BELIEVES IRAN'S SECURITY AND EVEN SURVIVAL MAY DEPEND, AS WELL AS TEST
                            OF OUR SINCERITY IN WANTING IRAN TO PLAY MAJOR STABILIZING ROLE IN GULF
                            AFTER <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> WITHDRAWAL IN KEEPING WITH NIXON
                            DOCTRINE WHICH UNDER SECRETARY RICHARDSON RECENTLY ASSURED SHAH WAS
                            RELEVANT TO IRAN'S FUTURE ROLE. AND, OF COURSE, IRAN'S COOPERATION NOT
                            ONLY IN FUTURE OF GULF BUT IN MANY OTHER MATTERS (FACILITIES,
                            OVERFLIGHTS, ONLY AIR CORRIDOR TO ASIA FROM EUROPE, ETC.) IS VITALLY
                            IMPORTANT, INDEED ESSENTIAL TO OUR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST.</p>
                        <p>6. THEREFORE, AT VERY MINIMUM WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>SG AT HIGH LEVEL (IF POSSIBLE BY SECRETARY
                            TO STEWARD IN ROME) TELL BRITISH VERY FRANKLY THAT WE THINK THEIR
                            PROPOSAL IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS: THAT COMING AT PRESENT TIME IT COULD
                            CREATE SERIOUS CRISIS WITH IRAN INVOLVING BOTH BRITAIN AND SHEIKHDOMS
                            WHICH COULD THREATEN FORMATION OF GULF FEDERATION; THAT IT COULD ALSO
                            ENVENOM GULF ATMOSPHERE IMPROVED BY IRAN'S STATESMANLIKE ACTION IN
                            GIVING UP ITS CLAIM TO BAHREIN, MAKING FUTURE IRAN-MODERATE ARAB
                            COOPERATION <pb n="5" xml:id="d68-05" facs="d68-05"/>(ON WHICH FREE
                            WORLD'S VITAL GULF INTEREST SO HEAVILY DEPEND) DIFFICULT IF NOT
                            IMPOSSIBLE THAT WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD CONCENTRATE THEIR ENERGIES AT
                            THIS TIME ON ACTIVE ENDEAVORS TO ACHIEVE AN IRAN-SHARJA SETTLEMENT ALONG
                            LINES OF REF A RATHER THAN MUDDYING WATERS WITH MICRO-LEGAL ARBITRATION
                            PROPOSAL RELATING TO OIL COMPANY INTERESTS AND RISKING A MAJOR CRISIS
                            WHICH BRITISH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL; AND THAT IF THEY PROCEED ON
                            ARBITRATION COURSE AND CREATE CRISIS WITH IRAN THEY MUST NOT EXPECT OUR
                            SUPPORT. IN SHORT, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> SHOULD BE REMINDED
                            OF VITAL INTEREST THEY, WE AND FREE WORLD AS WHOLE HAVE IN ENSURING
                            MAXIMUM DEGREE OF STABILITY IN GULF AFTER BRITISH WITHDRAWAL (GULF

                            TUNBS; AND THAT STEWART ONLY RECENTLY REASSURED IRANIANS <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> WILL USE ITS FULL INFLUENCE WITH GULF
                            RULERS TO BRING ABOUT SETTLEMENT (MAY 15 CENTO COUNCIL OF MINISTERS,
                            STATE'S 075132).</p>
                        <p>7. WE URGE THIS COURSE OF ACTION BECAUSE OUR OWN INTERESTS IN GULF ARE OF
                            PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND BECAUSE WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WITH DEPARTURE
                            OF BRITISH MILITARY FROM GULF NEXT YEAR, BRITISH INFLUENCE THERE WILL

                            WHICH GIVES SOVIETS RIGHT MILITARILY TO OCCUPY IRAN IF DEVELOPMENTS
                            THERE THREATEN SOVIET UNION.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH WANTED <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO KNOW AT TOP LEVEL
                            THAT FOLLOWING REFERENCES BY PODGORNY AND SOVIET AMB SOME WEEK AGO
                                (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) ANOTHER HIGH SOVIET
                            OFFICIAL (I UNDERSTOOD IT WAS HIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF SOVIET DELEGATION
                            TO JOINT IRAN-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ECONOMIC COMMITTEE)
                            HAD AGAIN REFERRED RECENTLY TO 1921 TREATY BUT WITH MORE MENACING
                            NUANCES WHICH ALSO INVOLVED US. IN MEETING WITH MINISTER OF ECONOMY
                            ANSARY, THIS SOVIET OFFICIAL REFERRED TO VISIT IN MAY JAMES LININGS
                            (TIME, INC.) US INVESTMENT GROUP, SAYING SOVIETS UNDERSTOOD MEMBERS OF
                            LINEN GROUP, INTERESTED IN JOINING WITH IRAN IN EXPLOITING FOREST IN
                            CASPIAN AREA. HE THEW REFERRED POINTEDLY TO <pb n="2" xml:id="d69-02" facs="d69-02"/>1921 TREATY AND RECENT PUBLIC COMMENT BY SHAH THAT
                            FRONTIER BETWEEN SOVIET UNION AND IRAN WAS FRONTIER OF FRIENDSHIP AND
                            PEACE. SOVIETS WANTED FRONTIER KEPT THAT WAY AND THEREFOR IF IRAN NEEDED
                            FOREIGN ASSISTANCE HE SUGGESTED, WITH HEAVY-HANDED HUMOR, THAT THEY GET
                            "ANGELS" TO HELP THEM EXPLOIT IRAN'S RESOURCES, ADDING THAT IN SOVIET
                            VIEW "AMERICANS ARE NOT ANGELS.”</p>
                        <p>3. ACCORDING TO KHALATBARI, <persName corresp="#p_AH1">ANSARY</persName>
                            REPLIED WITH SOME SPIRIT THAT 1921 TREATY SIGNED BEFORE UN CAME INTO
                            EXISTENCE AND THAT UN CHARTER AND NOT 1921 TREATY GOVERNED RELATIONS
                            BEWEEN TWO COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, NOT JUST AMERICANS BUT BRITISH,
                            FRENCH, WEST GERMANS, SOVIETS THEMSELVES AND OTHERS WERE COOPERATING
                            WITH IRAN IN DEVELOPMENT OF ITS RESOURCES. IRAN COULD NOT RECOGNIZE THAT
                            THERE WAS ANY DIFFERENCE IN SUCH FRIENDLY FOREIGN COOPERATION WHETHER IT
                            OCCURRED IN NORTH CENTER OR SOUTH OF IRAN. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">ANSARY</persName> ALSO POINTED OUT THAT SOME YEARS AGO IRAN HAD
                            MADE CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN COMPANY (FAIRHURST CO.) RE FORESTRY IN NORTH
                            AND ASKED WHY AT THIS LATE DATE SOVIET UNION SUDDENLY FELT OBLIGED TO
                            RAISE THIS MATTER. SOVIET OFFICIAL TURNED ASSIDE ANSARY'S RIPOSTE WITH
                            ANOTHER HEAVY-HANDED ATTEMPT AT HUMOR AND DROPPED SUBJECT.</p>
                        <p>4. SHAH WANTED TO KNOW OUR VIEW AS TO WHY SOVIETS AT THIS JUNCTURE
                            PUTTING THINLY VEILED PRESSURE ON IRAN THROUGH 1921 TREAT. "WHAT DOES US
                            THINK THIS MEANS?" KHALATBARI SAID WHAT WORRIES SHAH IS THAT SOVIETS MAY
                            BE READING EXTREME PREOCCUPATION OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA AND TO LESSER EXTENT ISRAEL-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> SITUATION AS INDICATION THAT <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>SG HAS SUCH URGENT PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE THAT IT HAS NEITHER
                            TIME NOR ENERGY TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH FUTURE OF PERSIAN GULF
                            REGION, THUS ENABLING SOVIETS TO BECOME "ARBITER" OF ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST.
                            SHAH, HE SAID, VIEWS SOVIET ACTIVITY IN MIDDLE EAST AS EXTENDED HAND
                            WITH FINGERS PROBING MEDITERRANEAN, IRAQ AND GULF, AFGHANISTAN, ETC.
                            SOVIETS HAVE BEEN ADVANCING INTO MIDDLE EAST WITH SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS
                            IN MUCH OF ARAB WORLD WHERE THEY ARE CONSIDERED NOT JUST AS SUPPORTER OF
                            ARABS AGAINST ISRAEL AND US BUT AS ACTUAL DEFENDER THROUGH SA-3 AND
                            SOVIET AIR SQDNS IN [ILLEGIBLE] EGYPT.KHALATBARI CONCLUDED "SHAH WISHED
                            TO FLASH YOU A RED LIGHT. HE FEELS RECENT SOVIET EFFORTS AT INTIMIDATION

                            INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT IRAQ. SHAH HOPES USG WILL MAKE CLEAR ITS INTEREST
                            IN THIS VITAL AREA AND WILL ALSO MOVE AHEAD WITH JOINT PROJECTS IRAN HAS
                            DISCUSSED WITH US WITH VIEW TO STRENGTHENING IRAN'S ABILITY TO COOPERATE
                            WITH OTHER LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES IN GULF TO ASSURE PEACE AND STABILITY

                            HAPPENS IN GULF AND OUR CONVICTION OF IMRORTANCE OF IRAN'S ROLE OF
                            LEADERSHIP IN AREA. INSOFAR AS IRAN'S MILITARY ACQUISITION PROGRAM
                            CONCERNED, WE SHOULD BE ABLE COMPLETE NEGOTIATION OF EIGHTH TRANCHE JUST
                            AS SOON AS FMS LEGISLATION PASSED CONGRESS AND IN MEANTIME GENERALS
                            TWITCHELL AND TOUFANIAN WERE WORKING ON AGREED STUDY TO OBTAIN OVER-ALL
                            PICTURE OF IRAN'S MILITARY REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW BEST WE
                            COULD ASSIST OUR IRANIAN FRIENDS WITH RESOURCES THAT WE COULD REASONABLY
                            EXPECT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO US.</p>
                        <p>6. KHALATBARI THEN SAID THAT SHAH AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            ALSO WORRIED BY ATTITUDE OF BRITISH GULF AREA, FEARING BRITISH <pb n="4" xml:id="d69-04" facs="d69-04"/>PLAYING SOME KIND OF DEVIOUS GAME. HE
                            SAID, WHILE BRITISH AMB WRIGHT ASSURES GOI BRITISH INFLUENCE IS BEING
                            USED WITH SHEIKHS OF SHARJA AND RAS-AL-KHAIMAH ON BEHALF OF ACCEPTABLE
                            SETTLEMENT IRAN RE ABU MUSA AND TUNBS ISLANDS, ON OTHER HAND BRITISH
                            OFFICIALS IN GULF ARE INDICATING TO SHEIKHS THAT RAF AIRCRAFT AND
                            BRITISH FORCES ARE THERE TO "PROTECT THEM" AGAINST IRANIAN OR OTHER
                            PRETENSIONS. IRANIANS ALSO ANGERED BY <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            FOREIGN MINISTER STEWART'S EXCHANGE WITH ZAHEDI DURING RECENT WASHINGTON

                            ASSERTION TO ZAHEDI WHEN LATTER TRIED TO PROBE HIM THAT HE (STEWART)
                            "WAS REALLY NOT INFORMED RE DETAILS.” KHALATBARI SAID THIS ABSURD IN
                            LIGHT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STEWART DURING HIS LAST VISIT HERE AND
                            PREOCCUPATION OF BRITISH FONOFF WITH ISLAND SITUATION AND UNHELPFUL
                            LEAKING TO PRESS IT HAS RECENTLY ENGAGED IN RE SHARJA AND UMM-AL-QAIWAIN

                            MAY 31 "SUNDAY TIMES" AS EXAMPLES.) KHALATBAR SAID: THERE ALSO RUMORS
                            BRITAIN MAY IN SOME WAY BE CONNIVING WITH IRAQ AND SOME IRANIANS BELIEVE
                            KUWAIT GOVT <pb n="5" xml:id="d69-05" facs="d69-05"/>WOULD NOT HAVE
                            PERMITTED RECENT PUBLICATION OF ANTI-IRANIAN AND PRO-IRAQ PRESS
                            COMMENTARY RE GULF ISLANDS UNLESS BRITISH, "WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN
                            CLOSE TO RULING FAMILY,” HAD GIVEN GREEN LIGHT.</p>
                        <p>7. FINALLY, THERE WAS INCIDENT LAST WEEK OVER ISLANDS INVOLVING AMB
                            WRIGHT AND FOREIGN UNDER SECY <persName corresp="#p_ZM1">ZELLI</persName>. ZELLI CONVOKED WRIGHT TO OFFICIALLY REQUEST
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> TO USE ITS AUTHORITY TO PREVENT
                            OCCIDENTAL FROM BEGINNING DRILLING. WRIGHT REPORTED THIS TO LONDON AND
                            SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS (PART OF WHICH HE READ TO ME WHICH I
                            THOUGHT A BIT EQUIVOCAL AND LEGALISTIC) WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS MADE
                            CLEAR BRITAIN OBLIGED TO PROTECT RIGHTS OF ITS PROTECTORATES, ETC. THIS
                            WAS INTERPRETED BY <persName corresp="#p_ZM1">ZELLI</persName> AS
                            "ARROGANT THREAT" THAT BRITIAN WOULD USE FORCE AGAINST IRAN IF IT
                            ASSERTED ITS RIGHTS TO ABU MUSA AND WAS SO REPORTED TO SHAH WHO I HEAR
                            WAS EXTREMELY DISPLEASED. WRIGHT SUBSEQUENTLY ASSURED ALAM AND FOREIGN
                            MINISTRY THERE NO RPT NO THREAT AND INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD READ TO
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM1">ZELLI</persName> WERE. CAREFULLY WORDED
                            IN TERMS OF BRITAIN'S LEGAL POSITION AND RESPONSIBILITIES. KHALATBARI
                            CONCLUDED BY SAYING THERE GROWING IRANIAN APPREHENSION THAT "BRITAIN
                            WILL LEAVE GULF IN SAME KIND OF MESS IN WHICH IT LEFT ADEN, INDIA,
                            PAKISTAN AND OTHER COLONIES FROM WHICH IT HAS WITHDRAWN.”</p>
                        <p>8. I SAID I COULD NOT OF COURSE SPEAK FOR BRITAIN AND ITS ACTIVITIES AND
                            RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO SHEIKHDOMS: HOWEVER, I COULD SEE NO RPT
                            NO CONCEIVABLE ADVANTAGE TO BRITAIN IN CONNIVING WITH IRAQ AND ON
                            CONTRARY I PERSONALLY FELT IRAQ REPRESENTED BASIC DANGER TO BRITISH
                            INTERESTS BECAUSE OF ITS HISTORIC CLAIMS AGAINST KUWAIT WHICH TODAY
                            HOLDS IN LONDON ABOUT 700 MILLION POUNDS STERLING AND FROM WHERE COMES
                            MUCH OF <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> OIL PAID FOR IN STERLING. FROM
                            MY TALKS WITH AMB WRIGHT, I BELIEVE HE QUITE SINCERE THAT BRITAIN WOULD
                            USE ITS INFLUENCE WITH SHEIKHS TO TRY TO PERSUADE THEM TO REACH AMICABLE
                            AGREEMENT WITH IRAN RE ISLANDS. HOWEVER, BRITAIN OBVIOUSLY HAD ITS OWN
                            PROBLEMS AND FROM PURELY LEGAL VIEWPOINT BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE WOULD
                            PROBABLY HAVE TO TAKE LEGAL POSITION WHICH JUSTIFIED ITS ORIGINAL ACTION
                            OF SEIZURE OF ISLANDS IN NINETEENTH CENTURY. TO EXPECT IT TO TAKE ANY
                            OTHER POSITION THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT BRITISH ACTIONS OVER 150 YEARS
                            HAD BEEN <pb n="6" xml:id="d69-06" facs="d69-06"/>ILLEGAL SEEMED
                            UNREALISTIC.</p>
                        <p>9. COMMENT: I HAVE REPORTED FOREGOING AT LENGTH BECAUSE FROM EVERY
                            QUARTER WE HEAR OF SHAH'S (A) INCREASING PREOCCUPATION WITH SOVIET
                            ADVANCES INTO THIS AREA AND (B) SHAH'S GROWING SUSPICION THAT IF BRITAIN
                            IS NOT PLAYING SOME DUBIOUS GAME OF ITS OWN DEVISING, IT IS AT LEAST
                            BEHAVING IN A WAY WHICH WILL MAKE MORE DIFFICULT MAINTENANCE OF PEACE
                            AND STABILITY IN GULF AFTER BRITISH WITHDRAWAL IN 1971. WHETHER OR NOT
                            SUSPICIONS AND FEARS OF SHAH AND SOME SENIOR MEMBERS OF HIS GOVT ARE
                            JUSTIFIED IS QUITE BESIDE POINT. UNHAPPY FACT AT THIS JUNCTURE IS THAT
                            SUCH SUSPICIONS AND APPREHENSIONS RE BRITAIN DO EXIST. WOULD GREATLY
                            APPRECIATE ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS, PARTICULARLY TO ALLEVIATE SHAH'S
                            APPREHENSION THAT WE ARE SO BOGGED DOWN IN SOUTHEAST ASIA THAT WE WILL
                            SIT BY AND LET SOVIETS SOVIETS FULFILL THEIR TRADITIONAL ASPIRATIONS AND
                            MOVE IN TO BECOME "ARBITER OF GULF AND ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST" AS SHAH PUTS

                        </list>
                        <p>There are three subjects to be covered at this meeting:</p>
                        <p>1. What should be our general strategy toward the Gulf? [Options 2 and 3
                            of State paper.]</p>
                        <p>For the sake of argument the paper poses four possible options: (a)
                            assuming the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s role as protector; (b)
                            backing either Iran or Saudi Arabia as the key to stability; (c)
                            pressing Saudi-Iranian cooperation; (d) actively promoting a regional
                            security pact. We can assume that the first and the last are
                            impractical.</p>
                        <p>The logical strategy lies in marrying what is already in fact extensive
                            support for Iran as the unquestioned power in the area with the logic of
                            cooperation between a strong Iran and a weak Saudi Arabia. We are not
                            likely to diminish our relationship with Iran; we do not want to have to
                            choose between Iran and Saudi Arabia; Saudi-Iranian cooperation is the
                            optimum.</p>
                        <p>That means that the real choice is not really a choice as long as there
                            is no trouble and Saudi-Iranian cooperation continues to grow. The real
                            choice will come when, for instance, the Iranians look as if they are
                            preparing to seize the small Arab-held islands at the mouth of the
                            Persian Gulf. In circumstances like that, we will have to ask ourselves
                            how much political capital to spend with the Shah to restrain Iran.</p>
                        <p>The first objective in this meeting therefore is to determine whether
                            there is general consensus on the following strategy: The logical U.S.
                            strategy is to promote Saudi-Iranian cooperation in the first instance
                            "but to recognize that Iran is the real power in the Gulf and to pursue
                            the fullest feasible U.S. -Iranian relationship in that context. [This
                            is a <pb n="2" xml:id="d70-02" facs="d70-02"/>counter to those who
                            argue, for instance, that our military credit assistance is making Iran
                            too powerful.]</p>
                        <p>In arriving at that working view of our strategy, we should avoid
                            relaxing and pinning all our hopes on Saudi-Iranian cooperation on Iran.
                            Cooperation may break down, and Iran may prove a heavy-handed
                            peace-maker. This brings us to the second question.</p>
                        <p>2. What kind of presence can the U. S. develop in the Gulf? [State paper,
                            pages 34-41.]</p>
                        <p>If the above is a logical view of U. S. strategy, the U.S. still has an
                            interest in making the Arab participants in this cooperation more
                            effective and stable partners.</p>
                        <p>The general issue to be discussed is: Can the U.S.—given present
                            restrictions on technical assistance relations with countries that have
                            their own money and limitations on funds for scholarships, not to
                            mention low USIA appropriations—realistically talk about an active U.S.
                            presence on the Arab side of the Gulf?</p>
                        <p>The fact is that U.S. does not now have programs and appropriations
                            geared to an area like the Gulf with its own money. Yet the area
                            desperately needs U.S. technical and educational assistance. At present,
                            it is kidding ourselves to talk about an active U.S. role in the
                            shaikhdoms without at the same time talking about increasing our
                            cultural exchange budget for the area or providing organized
                            backstopping for a technical assistance effort (mainly using private
                            U.S. experts for whom the shaikhs would pay).</p>
                        <p>One outcome of the discussion might be to ask State to draw up now for
                            possible use in connection with the FY 1972 budget a comprehensive U. S.
                            program—cultural exchange, trade promotion, technical assistance,
                            diplomatic representation-which would represent the most imaginative
                            U.S. effort in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>As a side point you may recall that the final paragraphs of the
                            President's foreign policy message to Congress alluded to the need for
                            new policies and programs in order for us to relate to areas like this
                            which have their own capital resources. The Persian Gulf is the classic
                            case. It is <pb n="3" xml:id="d70-03" facs="d70-03"/>therefore worth
                            pushing the above suggestion if for no other reason than to push the
                            staffing of a problem which the President has identified under his
                            signature. See Tab marked "Programs.”</p>
                        <p>3. Should we maintain our small naval force in the Persian Gulf based on
                            Bahrain?</p>
                        <p>Everyone agrees this is more a psychological presence than a very useful
                            military force. There has been some argument for removing it on grounds
                            of its low military value. There has even been some hint that the Shah
                            is not especially anxious to see us stay on. However, there has also
                            been a feeling that now is not the time to reduce our presence even
                            though we may be ready to concede that the force is not necessarily
                            going to be welcome for any extended period.</p>
                        <p>The operational problem is this: If we wish to keep the force there, the
                            British will have to arrange with the Bahrainis for us to go on using a
                            small port facility with a U.S. flag over it. We would want to sound out
                            the Shah in more detail.</p>
                        <p>The decision required is a decision in principle not to reduce our
                            presence at this time. That would trigger the necessary feelers to
                            determine feasibility.</p>
                        <p>While it is difficult to see the force having great utility, on balance
                            it does seem the wrong moment to remove it.</p>
                        <p>Outcome of the meeting. We recommend that you propose a short memo for
                            the President (which we would draft) seeking his endorsement of:</p>
                        <p>1. the general U.S. strategy proposed; </p>
                        <p>2. in principle not reducing our naval force (if that is the judgment of
                            the Group); </p>
                        <p>3. drafting a plan for fuller U. S. representation in the shaikhdoms. We
                            would then put out an <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>.</p>

                                an agreement with Iran over the Gulf islands, so as to prevent an

                                claims to the islands, would meet Iran's basic security
                                requirements. If the British did so, <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> suggested that the United States use its

                        <p>1. We concur fully in reassurances you gave Acting Foreign Minister
                            KHALATBARI as well as expression of our belief that there no conceivable
                            advantage to British conniving with Iraq to Iran's disadvantage. We
                            consider London's 4351 excellent statement on latter point and general
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> attitude toward Gulf and you
                            authorized draw on it as seems appropriate. In reconfirming assurances
                            you have already given Iranians you may also wish to draw attention to
                            fact that it was only two months ago that you reconfirmed in writing and
                            on instruction <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> continued adherence
                            to the validity of the US-Iranian bilateral of March 5, 1959. You may
                            also cite our move into Cambodia as clear evidence our resolve and
                            ability to act when we <pb n="2" xml:id="d71-02" facs="d71-02"/>believe
                            our interests affected. This step was taken in the full realization that
                            it would not meet with full public approval. We believe that the
                            conclusion the other side will draw from this is clear notwithstanding
                            the heightened public debate it has generated in the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. While it is possible Soviets sought remind hosts of more favorable
                            aspects of 1921 Soviet/Iran Treaty which replaced onerous and
                            distasteful Czarist conventions, it is far more likely that Soviets have
                            developed some suspicion that US intends to move in behind British after
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> withdraws from Gulf in 1971.
                            Pursuing this line of thought Soviets may have speculated US may ask
                            Iran for military base facilities. Reminding Iranians of 1921 Treaty
                            would, of course, put Iran on notice as to what Soviet reaction likely
                            to be. This would be consistent with earlier Soviet behavior when it
                            trotted out 1921 Treaty in attempt to force Iran to sign nonaggression
                            pact in <pb n="3" xml:id="d71-03" facs="d71-03"/>early 1960's. Soviets
                            also mentioned it when it was in process of obtaining Iranian assurances
                            that no American missiles would be stationed on Iranian soil.</p>
                        <p>3. Finally, it is probably also a Soviet reminder that the Soviets can be
                            difficult if the occasion requires.</p>
                        <p>4. While we agree with Iran that there is no room for complacency, we
                            nonetheless do not believe that Soviet power and influence in the Middle
                            East or the Gulf should be overdrawn. Soviet relations with Syria and
                            Iraq, for example, are not uniformly harmonious or entirely to Soviet
                            liking. Both countries have demonstrated decidedly independent attitudes
                            when the Soviets appear to become too overbearing. Further, indigenous
                            Communist political parties have had anything but unqualified success.
                            Indeed there are recent reports of anti-communist activities by
                            governments of both countries with arrests being made of a number of
                            Communist Party members. We believe, therefore, that Soviet efforts to
                            become arbiters of Gulf and <pb n="4" xml:id="d71-04" facs="d71-04"/>entire Middle East face formidable obstacles not only from strong
                            moderate countries such as Iran but also from indigenous forces in
                            countries where it has already established a substantial presence.</p>
                        <p>5. Hope you agree point to be made is that we are resolved to stand by
                            our commitments, to support our friends, and we have great confidence in
                            Iran's own ability withstand Soviet blandishments or thinly veiled
                            threats.</p>

                        <p>Iran's determination to continue its domestic opium production program so
                            long as its neighbors continue to produce opium, was again evidenced in
                            two recent developments:</p>
                        <p>1. In a television interview on May 25 the Shah restated the reasons why
                            Iran had resumed poppy cultivation and instituted the death penalty for
                            narcotics smuggling, noting that it was ridiculous for Iran to have
                            banned opium and given up foreign exchange from legal international
                            sales, only to find its addicts exporting large sums for smuggled opium
                            and its prisons full of thousands of Iranians convicted of narcotics
                            offenses. He said that so long as Iran's neighbors continue poppy
                            cultivation Iran had "no alternative but to continue to do the same to
                            fulfill our local needs.” But he added that "if the cultivation of
                            poppies in our neighboring countries comes to a stop, we would also put
                            an end to cultivation.” (See Enclosure No. 1 for full statement.)</p>
                        <p>2. The press on May 28 reported that the Ministry of Land Reform had
                            doubled the acreage to be allotted for the coming year to poppy
                            cultivation raising the total area authorized for planting for the 1971
                            crop to 12,000 hectares. (See Enclosure No. 2 for comparative area
                            break-down.)</p>

                        <p>COMMENT: Obviously the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> still
                            considers it essential, in order to eliminate the heavy illicit
                            importation of opium into Iran, to pursue vigorously its two-pronged
                            program of strict anti-smuggling controls and of controlled provision of
                            home-grown opium for incurrable Iranian addicts and those under
                            treatment. As previously reported, there is evidence that the program
                            has began to affect smuggling. There seems little prospect that Iran
                            will consider restricting or eliminating poppy cultivation before seeing
                            persuasive evidence of poppy elimination and control in Turkey and
                            perhaps even Afghanistan. However the Shah's comments that production
                            will continue in order to meet "local needs" may indicate that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has abandoned its earlier notion
                            of producing for export. Opium production to date has been low and costs
                            of production have far exceeded world market prices; perhaps the hard
                            reality that Iran simply cannot compete profitably in the declining
                            world market has finally been recognized. Collection of the 1970 opium
                            crop is now in its final stages, but the Embassy has no estimate yet of
                            the total quantity produced or even of the number of hectares actually
                            cultivated out of the 6,200 hectares previously authorized for
                            planting.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>I thank you for your letter of 8th June, and I appreciate very much your
                            thoughtfulness in sending to me a copy of the text of your interim
                            report on the Cambodia operation which I have read with great
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>My Minister for Foreign Affairs, following his return from Washington,
                            has given me a detailed account of his discussions with you and the
                            members of your Government which took place entirely in an atmosphere
                            fraught with cordiality and an understanding of Iran and its
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>All this is a source of great encouragement and gratification. However,
                            in the meantime, new developments have again occurred which may have a
                            negative bearing on the future destinies of this region. New and
                            reliable information has been received to the effect that intense
                            efforts and endeavours will be made to upset the security of the Persian
                            Gulf area. It appears that plans are in the making to threaten and
                            possibly to gain control of the strategic Straits of Hormoz by
                            exercising influence on the Tumbs and Abu Musa Islands, which were
                            forcibly wrested from Iran by the British sixty-seven years ago.</p>
                        <p>The danger to Kuwait is probably known to all and if the recent events in
                            Hashemite Jordan should lead to an eventual takeover by extremists, then
                            Saudi Arabia will face grave danger, and we will perforce have to
                            re-evaluate our defence arrangements. We will have to face up to all
                            these eventualities and in order to be able to achieve this we must take
                            the necessary steps to equip and prepare ourselves.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile, the question of the 8th tranche is not yet completely
                            settled. The United States of America does not purchase oil directly
                            from Iran, and not only will the Oil Consortium provide us this year
                            with a decrease in oil revenues of $120m from the total amount which we
                            had set ourselves, but the outlook for 1971 and 1972 seems even
                            gloomier.</p>
                        <p>I believe it my historic duty to discuss these questions with you, Mr.
                            President, once again. For just as my predictions for the last ten years
                            have unfortunately turned out to be correct, if we do not <pb n="2" xml:id="d73-02" facs="d73-02"/>take steps to meet the requirements
                            of Iran and if this is not undertaken as soon as possible, a situation
                            will arise where it will unfortunately be too late to do anything the
                            consequences of which will be immeasurable.</p>
                        <p>I therefore urge you most emphatically to provide Iran with a sufficient
                            oil importation quota which will enable us to purchase our requirements,
                            or at least our defence equipment from the United States of America.
                            Another alternative concerns the decision of Libya to decrease her daily
                            production of oil by 800,000 barrels which amount could at least be
                            taken off from Iran and the matter will thus be solved.</p>
                        <p>The system of annual tranches is a source of great inconvenience and
                            perhaps it would be possible for us to draw up a five year plan in this
                            respect which would settle the matter for this period of time. If you,
                            Mr. President, were to solve the question of the direct purchase of
                            Iranian oil by your country or to adopt the above mentioned alternative
                            as regards taking off 800,000 barrels per day from Iran, we would then
                            be able to enter with your approval into contracts with American firms
                            in order to buy our requirements. This would also preclude the necessity
                            of seeking the approval of the legislature of the United States of
                            America as in the case of the yearly tranches.</p>
                        <p>I should greatly appreciate it, Mr. President, if you would kindly give
                            these matters your very urgent and considerate attention.</p>

                        <p>1. Very much appreciate your concern over the consequences of indefinite
                            delay in <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> legislation which I share.
                            We have been taking virtually hourly readings on <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> prospects and cannot truthfully predict yet what the
                            outcome may be.</p>
                        <p>2. In line with your suggestion we have taken an earnest and in-depth
                            examination of the possibilities of acquiring credit from some other
                            source to provide loan funds hitherto expected to be available under
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>. Specifically we have focused on
                            Eximbank as a possible source of these funds. The Bank has been
                            exceedingly cooperative in helping us to consider what might best be
                            done. I think that, other things being equal, we could have perhaps
                            reached agreement that the Bank would provide the funds we need for
                            Iran. We also had to consider, however, the impact this move would have
                            on <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d74-02" facs="d74-02"/>prospects. The fact that Iran
                            is presently included in the bill is a strong argument in favor of its
                            passage and one that we have used very recently in urging Congressional
                            action. After considering all aspects we had to conclude that Iran's
                            withdrawal at this juncture would jeopardize further prospects which are
                            already by no means reassuring. We badly need <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> for a number of other countries, some of whom are in
                            our own <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> area. These countries for
                            various reasons have no chance of obtaining alternative financing. I
                            concluded therefore that the risks of weakening the prospects of <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> legislation were too great from an
                            overall point of view and that we would have to continue to bank on
                            last-minute favorable Congressional action on <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. For your own very confidential information I want you to know that
                            should <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> legislation fail to pass for
                            this fiscal year we will make very special efforts to push for a
                            supplemental which would provide for funds in addition to those
                            presently contemplated for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971.</p>

                            foreign ministers, you asked Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> just how far the U.S. could go in
                            leaving it to Iran to guarantee stability in the Persian Gull. His
                            response is attached but these are its main conclusions:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What Iran Can Do</p>
                        <p>(1) Iran has a formidable military capability which — short of direct
                            Soviet aggression — can defend itself from any foreseeable attack. It
                            has the assistance of U.S. military sales credits to help it enhance
                            this capacity over the next few years with the objective of becoming a
                            deterrent of such credibility that it will not be seriously
                            challenged.</p>
                        <p>(2) Iran is making diplomatic efforts to secure trans-Gulf friendship and
                            cooperation. [They have successfully resolved the Bahrain issue; they
                            are talking to the Saudis about military cooperation; and they are
                            offering aid and support to the Gulf states.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Complications</p>
                        <p>—The traditional Arab/Persian antagonism cannot be overcome
                            overnight.</p>
                        <p>—The Arab-Israeli dispute complicates Iran's efforts to move closer to
                            the Arab states. Its relations with Israel and its <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> role are visible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What Iran Cannot Do</p>
                        <p>(1) It cannot prevent — despite its military capacity — incipient
                            subversion or revolution among its neighbors, nor arbitrate always
                            successfully disputes among the Gulf states rooted in traditional
                            rivalries and conflicting territorial claims.</p>
                        <p>(2) Arab radicalism — despite Iran's money and support to the moderates —
                            will have to be dealt with in the end by indigenous <pb n="2" xml:id="d75-02" facs="d75-02"/>forces. Its ability to stem Soviet
                            influence — working through Arab radicalism — will also be limited.</p>
                        <p>On balance, it would appear that Iran should continue to seek the active
                            cooperation of its Islamic neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>A fuller study of the Gulf and discussion of U.S. strategy — including
                            this question of how heavily we can depend on Iran — will be on its way
                            to you through the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> process.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IRAN AND THE PERSIAN GULF</p>
                        <p>By the end of 1971 the British will have withdrawn militarily from the
                            Persian Gulf. Their departure ends a century and a half of control in
                            the lower Gulf sheikhdoms which excluded unfriendly major powers,
                            suppressed radical dissidents, and kept under control long-standing
                            intra-Arab and Arab/Persian antagonisms. The prospect of the British
                            departure has brought an air of uneasiness to the Gulf. Some wish the
                            British would remain, but most accept the inevitability of their
                            leaving.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of Iraq, which is already under its sway, radical
                            Arabism is the thing most feared by the Gulf states. Interrelated with
                            this fear is the fear of Soviet encroachment. All know the Soviets favor
                            radical Arabism and all know of the favorable position the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has established in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria and Iraq.</p>
                        <p>In looking to the future two movements have gotten underway. On the Arab
                            side of the Gulf cautious steps have been taken by the nine sheikhdoms
                            to band together in a Federation of Arab Amirates.(*)Age-old jealousies
                            and suspicions make it an uphill fight. On theother side of the Gulf,
                            Iran, the most powerful and stable nation in the area, has made clear
                            its intention to assume a leading role in providing for the security of
                            the Gulf in the future.</p>
                        <p>(*) Bahrain, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm
                            al-Qaiwain, Fujairah. Total population 453,000 of which 200,000 is on
                            Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>What Iran Can Do. Iran already has a formidable military capability which
                            it is rapidly augmenting against <pb n="4" xml:id="d75-04" facs="d75-04"/>the day the British leave. It has the resources (over $1 billion
                            yearly from oil) and the manpower (28 million population) to sustain its
                            armed might and defend itself from any foreseeable attack short of
                            direct Soviet aggression. Iran's goal is to develop a deterrent of such
                            credibility that no area nation or likely combination would dare attack
                            it or seriously challenge Iranian unrestricted use of the Persian Gulf
                            or access to the waters beyond.</p>
                        <p>Iran has sought US military sales credits to help it create this
                            deterrent. We have responded with credit of $100 million for each of the
                            last two years and plan to continue a program of this magnitude for at
                            least another 4-5 years, Congressional approval permitting. Used wisely,
                            as we hope and expect it will be, this military force can be an
                            important factor in preserving stability and security in the Persian
                            Gulf after 1971.</p>
                        <p>Iran recognizes the need, however, to supplement this force with a
                            skillfully contrived and executed program of diplomatic initiatives
                            aimed at securing trans-Gulf friendship and cooperation. Having foregone
                            its claim to Bahrain, it has begun assiduously to woo its Gulf Arab
                            neighbors by invitation to Tehran, the dispatch of special envoys and
                            good will missions, and the offer of financial and technical aid. It has
                            talked quietly with its largest Arab neighbor, Saudi Arabia, about
                            military cooperation and steps Iran might take to come to Saudi aid in
                            time of emergency.</p>
                        <p>The successful pursuit of this policy will require tact, patience, time
                            and doubtless some money. It faces formidable obstacles. Fundamental is
                            historic Arab/Persian antagonism. The Persians are ethnically different,
                            they rarely conceal their belief that Arabs are inferior, and the
                            Persians are of a branch of Islam which is considered heretical by
                            orthodox Muslims. <pb n="5" xml:id="d75-05" facs="d75-05"/>Added to
                            these historical differences is Iran's circumspect but nonetheless
                            well-known relations with Israel. The Arab/Israel conflict obviously
                            makes it difficult for even moderate Arabs overtly to get very close to
                            Iran. Prolongation of the Arab/Israeli confrontation or another outbreak
                            of widespread armed conflict could either end nascent friendships
                            between Iran and Arab states or force Iran to lean more heavily in the
                            direction of the Arabs. Indeed there are already signs that Iran would
                            give preference to improving its Arabic relations. Iran's <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> connection with the West is also a
                            liability in the context of developing closer relations with the Arabs.
                            The introduction of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> into the
                            Persian Gulf would particularly alarm Arabs.</p>
                        <p>What Iran Cannot Do. While Iran's military power and example of a stable,
                            well-run nation doubtless stands for much, it cannot prevent incipient
                            subversion and revolution among its neighbors. Nor can it do much to
                            arbitrate the squabbles which will inevitably arise among sheikhdoms and
                            states on the Arab side of the Gulf which are also rooted in age-old
                            rivalries and conflicting territorial claims. Iran itself is involved in
                            two disputes which concern several small islands (Abu Musa and the
                            Tunbs) which guard the entrance to the Persian Gulf. As often as not
                            these disputes are grievously complicated by the actual or suspected
                            presence of oil.</p>
                        <p>Iran's ability to contain the growth of radical Arabism in the area is
                            also severely circumscribed. It can provide some money and moral support
                            for moderate regimes but in the end it is a matter that can be dealt
                            with decisively only by indigenous forces. Iran's ability to prevent the
                            growth of Soviet influence in the Gulf area through the ascendance of
                            radical Arabism is also very limited. The Soviets have reflected
                            increasing interest in the Gulf. Whether they will move cautiously in
                            the interest of preserving good relations with <pb n="6" xml:id="d75-06" facs="d75-06"/>Iran, Turkey and Pakistan is problematical. The
                            Soviets maintained a position of neutrality in the recent dispute
                            between Iran and Iraq over the Shatt al-Arab River. This position was
                            assumed even though Soviet influence in the Gulf area is concentrated
                            mainly in Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Conclusion. There a substantial and positive role Iran can play in
                            providing for the security and stability of the Persian Gulf after the
                            British leave in 1971. There are also real limits to what it can
                            achieve. Its best chance of achieving its purpose lies in its gaining
                            the active cooperation of its Islamic neighbors, particularly Saudi
                            Arabia and Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>Summary<lb/> The position of "Pishva" or leader of the Shiite sect of
                            Islam became vacant on June 1st upon the death of Ayatollah Hakim, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is attempting to have a
                            religious leader who is resident in Iran and not opposed to the Shah's
                            rule, chosen to take his place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> efforts in support of two leading
                            Iranian Shi'ite divines, Ayatollah Shariat-MADERI and Ayatollah
                            Khonsari, have been counter-productive since its activities have
                            generated suspicion among the Ulema, or religious leaders, who
                            traditionally distrust the government and resent its interference in
                            religious matters. The leading contender for the leadership among the
                            faithful is</p>
                        <p> Ayatollah Khomeini, who commands considerable respect and popularity in
                            the bazaars of Iran. However, his residence in Iraq and his firm
                            opposition to the Shah make him totally unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> which, in turn, virtually precludes his
                            becoming the new Pishva. The selection of a new leader is adversely
                            affecting the already strained relations between Iran and Iraq. Iran, as
                            the population center of world Shi'ism, claims the right to veto the
                            selection of a leader it finds unacceptable; Iraq would favor the
                            selection of Khomeini, due in large measure to his antipathy toward the
                            Shah. Because of the different attitudes and goals of the governments,
                            it is likely the position of Pishva will remain vacant for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Ayatollah* Seyed Mohsen HAKIM, the spiritual leader of the world's
                            million Shiite Muslims, died on June 1 in Baghdad, at the age of <pb n="2" xml:id="d76-02" facs="d76-02"/>84. The choice of a pishva to
                            succeed Hakim immediately became a prime topic of concern in Iran, where
                            92% of its 29 million inhabitants are adherents of Shi'ite Islam, making
                            Iran the heart of the Shi'ite world. There is a very elastic and
                            informal procedure for choosing a new Pishva. According to Shi'ite
                            theology, there must be a consensus of the Ulema on who should be the
                            new leader. Considering the inherently political nature of Shi'ite
                            Islam, the consensus is hard to achieve and is usually won only by a man
                            noted not only for his piety and learning but also for his political
                            astuteness in balancing different factions and views. The procedure also
                            makes it difficult for any government to control the choice since the
                            opinions of all leading clerics must be considered, not merely the views
                            of a formal body similar to the College of Cardinals in the Catholic
                            Church.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] *Title given to leading Shi'ite clerics.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is acutely aware of the
                            considerable influence the Ulema still have in Iranian society and see
                            the benefits to be gained from the selection of a Pishva who is resident
                            in Iran and not critical of the Shah. Consequently, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> efforts to influence the choice of a
                            new Pishva have been quite intense.</p>
                        <p>The Shah declared three days of official mourning upon Hakim's death, and
                            sent condolence messages to the Hakim's son in Baghdad and to two
                            leading Iranian clerics. The Iranian charge in Baghdad called on Hakim's
                            son to express the Shah's condolences and also attended Hakim's funeral.
                            The Ayatollah was praised in the Persian press as a man of great
                            learning and a light to the Shi'ite faith. These actions not only
                            confirmed the Government's bona fides as a supporter of the faith but
                            were also indicative of the esteem in which Hakim was held in Iran. This
                            is all the more notable considering Hakim generally opposed the Shah's
                            rule and, although of Iranian parentage, never visited Iran, even after
                            being invited by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Government chose two leading Iranian Shi'ite divines as its
                            candidates for Pishva of the faithful - Ayatollah Haj Seyed Kazan
                            SHARIAT-MADERI of Qom and Ayatollah Haj Seyed Ahmad Mousavi KHONSARI of
                            Tehran. Although the Government made no public announcement indicating
                            its support for the two clerics, its preferences were obvious. The
                            Shah's condolences were sent only to them and to no other Ayatollah of
                            equal standing. Press reports speculating on the choice of the new
                            Pishva have repeatedly played up both of the clerics, especially
                            Shariat-MADERI. Both clerics had certain attributes which made them
                            natural choices from the government's point of view. They are highly
                            esteemed among the Ulema in Iran, they live in Iran — and most important
                            — they are apolitical, thereby posing no threat to the Government.</p>
                        <p> Shariat-MADERI, the leading choice of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, is 68 years old, an Azerbaijani, a teacher of Shi'ite
                            law and tradition, an expert in trade and business, and generally
                            recognized as a man of great piety and knowledge. His knowledge of
                            Shi'ite commercial law has given him a broad following in the bazaars
                            throughout Iran. He is also relatively liberal on questions of family
                            law and education, thereby making him even more attractive to the
                            Government. <pb n="3" xml:id="d76-03" facs="d76-03"/>He does not,
                            moreover, have the reputation of being a Government supporter, which
                            would preclude him from being considered as Pishva, for the Ulema view
                            with suspicion any religious leader with close ties to the Government.
                            He is apolitical, believes in minimizing Shi'ite political activities
                            and dedicates himself to furthering Shi'ite religious teachings. The
                            Government, however, faces a number of obstacles in its efforts to have
                            Shariat-MADERI chosen as Pishva. Ulema opposed to his selection have
                            seized on the telegram sent by the Shah, and the fact that he replied to
                            it, as proof that he is a "lackey" of the Government and not deserving
                            of the title of Mara-e.-Taqlid - "Source of Imitation”.</p>
                        <p>Opposition to his elevation exists from other quarters as well. The
                            clandestine radios, realizing Pishva who is not opposed to the Shah
                            would reduce opportunities for encouraging dissidence among religious
                            elements, view the government push for Shariat-MADERI with apprehension.
                            The National Voice of Iran* noted that "the Coup d'etat regime was
                            shamelessly attempting to turn his (Hakim's) death into a victory for
                            their dirty designs and appoint one of their stooges as his
                            successor.”</p>

                        <p>The strongest opposition to Shariat-MADERI comes from Iraq, the
                            theological center for Shi'ite Islam, where the leading candidate for
                            Pishva is Ayatollah Ruhalla KHOMEINI. Khomeini lived in Iran until 1965
                            when he was exiled to Istanbul for his opposition to the Shah's reform
                            programs and the Government's interference in religious matters. He went
                            from Istanbul to Iraq and has resided there ever since. Khomeini is not

                            machinations. His opposition to the Shah's rule is well-known, making
                            him more attractive to the Iraqi Government but anathema to Iran.
                            Although the selection of a new Pishva is on the surface strictly a
                            religious matter, it assumes political, importance because both Iran and
                            Iraq have sizeable Shi'ite communities (48% of the Iraqi population),
                            and the strained relations between the two countries are undoubtedly
                            exacerbated by their respective maneuverings to influence the selection
                            of a leader.</p>
                        <p> Khomeini has strong support among the bazaaris and Ulema in Tehran and
                            his selection is also being encouraged by Iraq and the clandestine
                            radios. His picture is being displayed in the bazaar and south Tehran
                            and some Mullahs have begun reading the daily prayers in his name — an
                            honor reserved for the leader of the Shilites. [<hi rend="italic">text

                        <p>It is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that any Ayatollah who does
                            not have <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> support will not be able to
                            assume the mantle of Pishva, <pb n="4" xml:id="d76-04" facs="d76-04"/>at
                            least for the 27 million Shi'ites in Iran. A recent English language
                            weekly published in Tehran noted that although political considerations
                            should not affect the choice of a Pishva, it is obvious that since Iran
                            is the center for world Shi'ism, no one could be chosen who did not have
                            the support of the GOT. Khomeini was mentioned specifically as falling
                            in the category of the non-acceptables.</p>
                        <p>Indications are that neither Shariat-MADERI nor Khonsari, because they
                            have been tainted with the Government brush, will receive the necessary
                            support among the Ulema to be chosen as the new Pishva. Although
                            Khomeini probably has the greatest support among the Ulema, the
                            opposition of the Government of Iran to his selection will probably
                            preclude his being named Pishva. Since the possibility of finding a
                            leader acceptable to both the Iraqi and Iranian governments is
                            negligible, the post will probably remain vacant for the foreseeable
                            future.</p>

                            question of whether our military sales to Iran are in our overall
                            interests, whether they may affect area security and stability, and
                            whether there is a military requirement for this equipment. In this

                        <p>4. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW WHETHER USG IS PRESENTLY CONSIDERING
                            REVERSING OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN AND GOING BACK ON OUR
                            UNDERSTANDINGS WITH SHAH (A) AT AT TIME WHEN A STRONG IRAN SEEMS MORE
                            IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO OUR OWN ESSENTIAL NATIONAL INTEREST IN GULF AND
                            (B) WHEN WE HAVE VITAL INTEREST THAT SOVIETS DO NOT UPSET OVER-ALL EAST-

                            FRIENDLY IRAN CAN MAKE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION BY BALANCINGOFF INCREASING
                            SOVIET INFLUENCE IN ARABIAN PENINSULA. AND AS WE HAVE ALSO POINTED OUT
                            BEFORE, IRAN PROVIDES ONLY RPT ONLY CORRIDOR FOR US TO DEPLOY EASTWARD

                        <p>5. IF, AS COULD BE READ INTO <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>,
                            WE ARE INDEED CONTEMPLATING REVERSING OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN, I
                            WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT PRICE WE WILLPAY IN TERMS OF OUR NATIONAL

                            AFFORD. SHAH IS DETERMINED TO GET THE EQUIPMENT FOR HIS FORCES THAT HE
                            BELIEVES IRAN'S SECURITY AND SURVIVAL REQUIRE. IF WE WILL NOT PROVIDE
                            IT, HE WILL OBTAIN IT FROM BRITAIN, FRANCE, GERMANY AND ITALY WHO ARE
                            ALL EAGER TO BECOME SUPPLIERS TO A COUNTRY WHICH THEY REGARD AS
                            IMPORTANT TO THEIR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS IN GULF AND IF WE SUDDENLYTURN
                            OUR BACK ON HIM AND SHUN HIM BY REVERSING OR CHANGING OUR POLICY WITH
                            RESPECT TO COOPERATING WITH HIM IN HIS MILITARY BUILD-UP, THERE WILL BE
                            AN END TO SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP SHAH FEELS FOR US WHICH HAS AND CAN
                            CONTINUE TO BE OF SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS. I
                            KNOW I NEED NOT POINT OUT AGAIN THAT WITH TERMINATION OF GRANT ECONOMIC
                            AID, THIS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP AND RESULTANT SPECIAL FACILITIES AS WELL

                            DEVELOP, AND EQUIP HIS FORCES SO THAT IRAN CAN SURVIVE EVEN IF, AS IS
                            POSSIBLE, OTHER SIDE OF GULF FALLS TO RADICAL ARABS AND THEIR SOVIET
                            SUPPORTERS. REFUSAL ON OUR PART TO CONTINUE COOPERATE WITH HIM IN
                            DEVELOPMENT OF HIS FORCES WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO A RUPTURE OF THIS
                            SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH WE HAVE SO CAREFULLY DEVELOPED OVER YEARS AND
                            WHICH IN LIGHT OF SOVIET PENETRATION OF MIDDLE EAST SEEMS FROM THIS
                            VANTAGE POINT MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO US.</p>

                        <p>6. WE ARE NOT RPT NOT IN ANY SENSE BLIND TO FACT THAT SHAH'S APPETITIE
                            FOR EQUIPMENT IS SOMETIMES EXCESSIVE. WE TOOK INITIATIVE IN GETTING AT
                            THIS PROBLEM LAST WINTER BY PERSUADING IRAN TO DRAW UP A SHOPPING LIST
                            OF EQUIPMENT WHICH BROUGHT TO ATTENTION OF SHAH AND PRIME MINISTER FOR
                            FIRST TIME COST IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT HIS THREE, SERVICES WANTED TO
                            ACQUIRE. WE THEN FOLLOWED UP BY PROPOSING TWITCHELL-TOUFANIAN STUDY
                            THROUGH WHICH WE HOPE TO PROVIDE BASIS FOR ORDERLY SELECTION OF
                            PRIORITIES AND HOPEFULLY A SCALING DOWN OF OVERALL REQUIREMENTS, ETC.
                            ALREADY SOME ITEMS AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAVE
                            BEEN DELETED FROM ORIGINAL SHOPPING LIST OF US EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, AS
                            SHAH INFORMED PRESIDENT, HE GIVES ABSOLUTE PRIORITY TO DEVELOPMENT OF

                            I DO NOT SEEN HIM REDUCING BASIC AIRCRAFT REQUIREMENTS HE INDICATED TO

                            WAY IS TO PROCEED BY JOINT STUDIES SUCH AS TWITCHELL-TOUFANIAN EFFORT
                            WHICH, SHOULD NOT ONLY INDICATE TOTAL MAGNITUDE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND
                            REAL COSTS BUT ALSO COST AND NECESSARY TIME LEAD IN VITALLY IMPORTANT

                            PURCHASES IT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY OXY SIGNING AGREEMENTS WITH

                            FIXED A JULY 31 DEADLINE) FOR PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL F-4 AND C-130
                            AIRCRAFT WHICH SHAH HAS MADE CLEAR TO US HE BELIEVES ESSENTIAL TO IRAN'S
                            VITAL SECURITY NEEDS. IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF OUR REFUSING TO LET
                            IRAN PURCHASE THESE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT, WE OWE IT TO SHAH TO TELL HIM
                            SO AND WHY. HOWEVER, IF WE DO SO, HE WILL TAKE SUCH ACTION ON OUR PART
                            AS PERSONAL AFFRONT AND A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND AS CLEAR

                            ESSENTIAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. AS I HAVE POINTED OUT, THIS WILL

                            153 foreign nationals). The annual cost to the U.S. to support these

                            million ($4.7 million is Service funded and $2.1 million is funded under

                        <p>There are a number of factors which militate against the maintenance, at
                            U.S. expense, of this large U.S. military representation in Iran. Among
                            these are our desire to reduce the U.S. military presence abroad, and
                            the fact that Iran's economy is such that it can afford to pay for the
                            military advice, materiel and services it requires.</p>
                        <p>While the military relationship is a very important factor in our overall
                            relations with Iran, I am convinced that a reduction in the size of
                                ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will not substantially
                            impair those relations, particularly if the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is reorganised functionally in such a way to be

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<lb/> WASHINGTON<lb/> July 30, 1970</p>
                        <p>Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                        <p>I greatly appreciated your letter and the frankness with which you wrote
                            me about problems of concern to both our countries, including your
                            assessment of developments in the Persian Gulf area. Such frankness also
                            characterized the good talks we had with your Foreign Minister during
                            his recent Washington visit and contributes greatly to better
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>I have delayed replying to your letter in the hope that I could send you
                            some definite word about the Foreign Military Sales bill, which I fully
                            appreciate is so important to your defense planning. To my very great
                            regret, this bill was delayed by Congressional debate and is presently
                            being considered by a Senate-House of Representatives conference. We
                            will be in touch with you as soon as we can see more clearly the outcome
                            of this conference. However, I am hopeful that this matter will be
                            resolved in the next two or three months. I can assure you that we are
                            extremely conscious of the problems this uncertainty causes you and we
                            intend to make every effort to find a practical solution.</p>
                        <p>While our system of annual tranches does cause inconvenience for both our
                            governments, I know you understand that the Congress only reluctantly
                            approves programs for more than even one year and we unfortunately
                            cannot settle the matter definitively for a five-year period. However, I
                            fully agree that there is great merit in planning military acquisitions
                            over a five-year period. Along these lines, I understand that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName>, with the full
                            cooperation of the U. S. military advisers in Tehran, is preparing a
                            study which will focus on all the factors related to the military
                            equipment which the armed services of your country wish to acquire. I
                            hope this study will be of value in helping you to reach decisions
                            regarding the priorities and programming of military acquisitions. It
                            should certainly provide a framework for the greatest possible
                            continuing cooperation between us. <pb n="2" xml:id="d80-02" facs="d80-02"/>I know of your concern over the possibility that the
                            islands of Abu Musa and the Tumbs might fall into hostile hands. I
                            sincerely hope that conversations you have had with the Sheikhs of
                            Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah will lead to an amicable arrangement for the
                            future of these islands.</p>
                        <p>I share your concern over recent events in Jordan which could make it
                            much more difficult to achieve a settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
                            As Your Majesty knows, my government has undertaken new initiatives in
                            the search for ways in which the two sides can be brought together to
                            discuss how they might settle their differences. I hope that these
                            efforts will continue to bear fruit and that I may count on you as I
                            have in the past for your understanding and support.</p>
                        <p>After receiving your letter, we have again given the matter of a special
                            oil import quota for Iran very careful thought. I greatly regret that
                            under the current program, we are unable to do anything in this regard
                            in the foreseeable future. As you know from past conversations, this
                            issue is a complex one for my government both economically and
                            politically, involving as it does this country's entire import system
                            and policy.</p>
                        <p>I recognize and sympathize with the economic difficulties that make it
                            desirable for Iran to maximize its oil revenues. Iran's welfare is of
                            great concern to us. I want you to know that we have urged several
                            American firms to explore urgently the practicality of purchasing
                            Iranian oil, at least in part as an offset to recent production
                            decreases ordered in Libya. I understand that serious discussions have
                            been taking place between your Government and at least one American
                            company. We shall continue to encourage other companies to try to find
                            ways of dealing with the particular problems each of them may have in
                            connection with shifting their purchases to or increasing them in Iran.
                            I hope that these initiatives will help in some significant measure.</p>

                        <p>1. Very much appreciate your comments and concerns about difficult issues
                            which would arise should we turn down certain Iranian requests purchase
                            additional military aircraft which Shah believes essential for his
                            security. Unquestionably a decision of this nature would be made only at
                            highest <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> levels.</p>
                        <p>2. We feel it important, however, that we and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> not overlook caveats set forth in our 1968 undertaking
                            to Shah. We take seriously and believe <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> does as well our annual military-economic review which,
                            among other things, calls for examination of impact of Iran's military
                            expenditures on other pressing economic development and social needs.
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d81-02" facs="d81-02"/>Fact that Iran might
                            acquire heretofore unanticipated resources through some special
                            arrangement with Occidental US Oil Co. does not in our view lessen the
                            need for both US and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to assess
                            carefully the broad policy implications as well as narrower financial
                            and manpower effects of major new purchases. Such assessments are not
                            intended and should not be interpreted as a sign of our lack of
                            confidence in the Shah or a signal that some basic <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy change is in the offing. Rather
                            they are intended to insure, however, that rational, conscious decisions
                            are made only after all relevant factors have been taken into
                            account.</p>
                        <p>3. In this connection we understand from
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> here that the Shah has
                            requested the McDonnell Douglas representative in Tehran to change its
                            letter of intent to indicate that Iran intends to purchase 73 rpt 73
                            F-4's. If this is correct it would indicate an expenditure of
                            approximately $300 million, not including spares and support equipment.
                            While we have <pb n="3" xml:id="d81-03" facs="d81-03"/>no reason to
                            believe that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is not well aware
                            of the condition that any such purchase contract is dependent on final
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> approval, we believe it
                            desirable to explicitly draw this fact to its attention at whatever
                            level you deem most appropriate and effective. In doing so you should
                            make it clear that a purchase of this magnitude will require most
                            careful consideration and will take some time. You may draw on the views
                            expressed in para 2 if there appears a need to elaborate on this
                            point.</p>

                        <p>1. In connection with Major General Palizban's visit to Headquarters
                            building on 18 August, the ACSI desires that all personnel who will be
                            in contact with Major General Palizban during his visit to the United
                            States be informed of the following information recently furnished by
                                ARMISH-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Tehran:</p>
                        <p>“It is important to note that Iranians have a tendency to want to buy or
                            be given exotic equipment which they are not prepared to use and, in
                            many instances, cannot afford to purchase. There is also a tendency to
                            accept a casual remark such as 'we will look into this and let you know'
                            as a definite promise to provide equipment, information or assistance.
                            Therefore, it is recommended that discussions and demonstrations take
                            into consideration imperial Iranian Army capabilities, costs, and the
                            U.S. national disclosure policy. Should the situation arise, General
                            Palizban should be politely informed that availability, price, etc.,
                            cannot be determined until after a specific purchase or other request is
                            received from his government.</p>
                        <p>2. Please brief the <gloss target="#t_DDCI1">DDCI</gloss> on the
                            substance of para 1 above prior to his luncheon meeting with Major
                            General Palizban scheduled for 1200 hours on 18 August 1970.</p>
                        <p>3. Also for the <gloss target="#t_DDCI1">DDCI</gloss>'s information,

                        <p>1. Major General Azizollah Palizban, Chief, Combined Intelligence and

                            Imperial Iranian Army, accompanied by his aide/interpreter, Major
                            Razavi, will visit the Headquarters building on 18 August 1970. He will
                            be your guest for lunch on that date at 1200, along with senior NE
                            Division officials (a guest list is attached). While here, General
                            Palizban will receive briefings from representatives of</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_OTR1">OTR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss>, and SE Division. An agenda of the briefings is attached in
                            the event that General Palizban raises some of the briefing topics in
                            conversation with you during lunch.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no cover for the visit to Headquarters building as General
                            Palizban is visiting the United States from 11 - 19 August 1970 as an
                            official guest of Major General J. A. McChristian, General Staff,
                            Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. [text not declassified] The
                            Agency Officer for the <pb n="3" xml:id="d82-03" facs="d82-03"/>visit
                            will be [text not declassified]</p>

                        <p>5. As a result of his position, General Palizban has direct access to the
                            Shah and responds to his personal guidance. In view of this, the General
                            may have been encouraged by the Shah to raise the following topics which
                            involve policy during meetings with high-level U.S. Government
                            officials:</p>
                        <p>a. He may attempt to get an indication of any change in basic policy
                            vis-a-vis Iran in view of its rapprochement with the Soviet Bloc and its
                            "independent foreign policy.” He will probably emphasize Iran's <pb n="4" xml:id="d82-04" facs="d82-04"/>role as a strong, stable nation
                            in the Middle East, an area in which the U.S. has few friends and little
                            influence as a result of the consequences of the June 1967 Arab/Israeli
                            War. Recommendation: Stress the U.S. Government's long established
                            friendship with and regard for</p>
                        <p>Iran as a strong and reliable ally in the Middle East. Also comment
                            favorably on the rapid rate of Iran's economic growth as well as the
                            social progress achieved under the leadership of the Shah.</p>
                        <p>b. Continued U.S. military sales to Iran under the Foreign Military Sales
                                (<gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>) credit authorization bill
                            currently under Congressional scrutiny. Recommendation: As stated by the
                            President as well as senior Department of State officials, reiterate
                            that the U.S. Government plans to continue the</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit authorization subject to
                            Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p>c. Increased importation of Iranian oil. Recommendation: Oil importation
                            quotas are established and regulated by Congress; they can only be
                            altered by Congressional action.</p>
                        <p>6. General Palizban has never had any previous meetings with Agency
                            Directors and/or Deputy Directors. He will most probably bring a gift
                            for the <gloss target="#t_DDCI1">DDCI</gloss> which is the Iranian
                            custom. The NE Division will purchase an appropriate gift for
                            presentation by the <gloss target="#t_DDCI1">DDCI</gloss> if the need
                            arises.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Military Sales authorization and appropriation legislation may
                            not be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. This has most serious
                            implications for our relations with Iran which has long-term commitments
                            for purchases of U.S. military equipment and payment obligations for
                            this equipment which will be coming due shortly. These obligations and
                            continuing economic development and military requirements have stretched
                            Iran's resources to the limit. It now faces a short-term financial
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>Iran has counted heavily on our fulfilling the undertaking we gave it in
                            1968 to help it finance purchases of U.S. military equipment over a
                            five-year period. If we are now unable to help our close relations with
                            Iran are bound to suffer and our position in this important area of the
                            world deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>The Department has concluded that we must move urgently in providing Iran
                            with alternative financing. We understand that it may be possible for
                            the Export-Import Bank to help.</p>
                        <p>We are therefore, with Department of Defense and Treasury concurrence,
                            urging the Export-Import Bank to be responsive to Iranian requests for
                            credit to finance its purchases of U.S. military equipment. This will,
                            of course, be a shift from the course of action we have been pursuing up

                            credit requirements through Foreign Military Sales legislation. It will
                            also mean that the Export-Import Bank will have to face recurring
                            requests from Iran for military credit at least through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '72 in accord with our 1968

                        <p>We believe that Export-Import Bank Chairman Kearns will consider it
                            prudent to advise the Congress of a favorable Bank decision to finance
                            Iran's military purchases. In this connection the Department believes it
                            would be most helpful for him to have an expression of White House
                            interest in this matter. Accordingly, we believe it would be helpful if
                            you were to write Chairman Kearns indicating White House belief, that,
                            provided Iran meets the Bank's normal lending criteria, it is in the
                            U.S. national interest that the Bank provide Iran with military credit
                            in amounts to be determined after consultation with the Department of
                            State and the Department of Defense. We hope you will find it
                            appropriate in this letter to urge Mr. Kearns to coordinate the timing
                            of any consultations on the Hill on this subject with the State
                            Department in order that they do not jeopardize any other consultations
                            designed to secure authorization for foreign military sales which are
                            currently stymied in the House-Senate Conference.</p>

                        <p>1. I am forwarding herewith a copy of a recent <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> study, Student Unrest Abroad. The Study assays the role
                            of students and the conditions of higher education in some thirty
                            countries and in so doing, strives to place in perspective the
                            relationship of student action and dissidence to other social and
                            political forces in these countries.</p>
                        <p>2. You may find of particular interest the first section of the Study,
                            "An Overview of Student Unrest, " which introduces the ensuing country
                            studies with some observations about the general phenomenon of student
                            dissidence. We have attempted to elaborate, for example, important
                            differences in the patterns of student political action as they occur in
                            the Communist world, the less developed countries and the industrialized
                            non-Communist societies.</p>
                        <p>3. I intend to keep the matter of world-wide student unrest under
                            periodic review and to bring Student Unrest Abroad up to date upon the
                            development of new evidence and insights.</p>

                        <p>Overt student opposition to the government, as well as other opposition
                            elements, has been almost nonexistent in recent years. The Shah is
                            firmly in control of the government and the country, and dissident
                            activity has been suppressed firmly and quickly by his security forces.
                            In addition, programs for reforms and for rapid economic development
                            which he has pushed have pre-empted many of the issues around which
                            intellectual opposition to the Shah was able to rally. As the economy
                            has boomed and as job opportunities have grown, most of the 40,000
                            university students have been increasingly concerned with securing their
                            place in the establishment rather than fighting it and seem in most
                            instances unwilling to risk their futures by political activity.</p>
                        <p>Political activism among University of Tehran students was, until recent
                            years, endemic; there were few years between the early 1950s and 1963
                            not marked by rioting and often bloody demonstrations. Traditionally,
                            the activists were nationalists, supporters of former Prime Minister
                            Mossadeq, of his National Front, or one of the offshoots of the National
                            Front. The Tudeh (Communist) Party was also heavily involved; Tudeh
                            Party cells were active on the campus for 15 years. A few of the early
                            Tudeh Party leaders were university professors, who retain a shadow
                            party-in-exile in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>In the past, student demonstrations were almost all antigovernment. The
                            Shah provided a natural target and the demonstrations were for the most
                            part unabashedly political, with little attempt to use genuine student
                            grievances as a pretext.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Present Student Attitudes</p>
                        <p>Most intellectuals and students apparently feel no sense of
                            identification with the regime <pb n="5" xml:id="d84-05" facs="d84-05"/>and its development programs, which are decided at the highest levels.
                            Antiestablishment sentiment is probably intensified by the lack of an
                            effective political opposition either in the universities or in the
                            society as a whole. No political organizations are permitted on
                            university campuses, and social organizations—primarily
                            government-sponsored "Youth Houses"—are closely watched by the security
                            forces and their informers. There is virtually no channel for effective
                            communication and no constructive outlet for student energies and
                            talents. Outspoken critics of the government have been expelled and
                            drafted.</p>
                        <p>A university education is today probably the most important requirement
                            for success in Iran. Despite their dissatisfaction with the political
                            system, therefore, most of Iran's students are unwilling to jeopardize
                            future job security by a confrontation with the police over political
                            ideology. In the past, many university graduates were unable to find
                            jobs and therefore had less to lose. Now, however, many of the brightest
                            graduates are absorbed into a burgeoning bureaucracy as participants in
                            the reform program, and the problem of an unemployed, disgruntled
                            educated class is beginning to fade.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recent Unrest</p>
                        <p>In recent years, student demonstrations have been aimed at specific
                            educational and economic grievances and appear to have had few political
                            overtones. Student disorders broke out in Tehran in February 1970
                            apparently as a spontaneous protest against an increase in bus fares.
                            Large-scale arrests were made, followed by further demonstrations
                            protesting the arrests. Most of the students arrested were subsequently
                            released. Some antigovernment leaflets were distributed, but the
                            disorders appear to have been apolitical in nature. In May, a small
                            group of students in Tehran attacked the Iran-American Society student
                            and academic centers, breaking <pb n="6" xml:id="d84-06" facs="d84-06"/>windows. The group, which seemed to be protesting US involvement in
                            Iran rather than the government of the Shah, was quickly dispersed.</p>
                        <p>The largest and most widespread disturbances in recent years broke out in
                            May and June of 1967 and again in January and February of 1968,
                            affecting all eight of Iran's institutions of higher learning. These
                            demonstrations were aimed primarily at pressing complaints about the
                            educational system; the students demanded, among other things, abolition
                            of newly instituted tuition fees, upgrading of degrees, higher
                            university budgets, and better facilities. Most of these demonstrations
                            were followed by others protesting police and security forces'
                            over-reaction and arrests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems in Higher Education</p>
                        <p>Iran's eight universities are in transition, changing from a system of
                            memorization and learning by rote to a more flexible, creative approach.
                            Conservative, religious-oriented students find this modernization
                            threatening, as do older entrenched professors. Others probably believe
                            that change is not coming fast enough.</p>
                        <p>The universities have had difficulty in attracting competent and dynamic
                            faculties, despite government efforts to recruit better qualified
                            teachers. At Tabriz, for example, until a reorganization in 1968, the
                            university was dominated by conservative, long-entrenched native
                            Azerbaijanis with questionable qualifications.</p>
                        <p>Although the apparent student-faculty ratios at Iranian universities are
                            not too bad, these figures are deceptive. At Tehran University, for
                            example, where the ratio was 28 to 1 in 1966, faculty members have been
                            only part-time teachers—medical professors with private practices,
                            economics professors with their own businesses, etc. Some top professors
                            reportedly have not shown up for classes in years. There has been
                            virtually no faculty-student relationship. Professors traditionally
                            deliver <pb n="7" xml:id="d84-07" facs="d84-07"/>lectures and depart
                            with little or no exchange with their students. The government now has
                            banned part-time teaching, but it is not known to what extent its ruling
                            has been enforced.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outside Influences</p>
                        <p>There is little evidence of off-campus influence on student activism.
                            Security officials, and in some instances university officials, charged
                            that Communists were active in the 1967-68 demonstrations; 20 of the 100
                            students arrested in the Tehran area in February 1968 were alleged to be
                            pro-Chinese Communist. This was not confirmed. There is some Communist
                            activity, consisting primarily of the circulation of a limited amount of
                            Soviet and Chinese propaganda, but generally its effectiveness has been
                            undercut by rapid economic and social development. A few Tudeh Party
                            cells continue to exist at the University of Tehran, but there is no
                            overt manifestation of their presence, and their covert activities are
                            directed mostly at staying alive.</p>
                        <p>In universities such as Pahlavi, which are in less urban areas, Muslim
                            religious leaders still have an influence over youth. About 50
                            religiously conservative Shirazi citizens were arrested following
                            disturbances at Pahlavi in February 1968 on charges of fomenting the
                            strikes.</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence that student revolts in the US, France, and other
                            countries have influenced the Iranian students, or that Iranian
                            dissidents abroad have had an impact on the local scene.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Government Approach to Student Problems</p>
                        <p>Iranian officials, from the Shah on down, are aware that the regime has
                            not been accepted by many intellectuals. They are anxious to keep youth
                            satisfied and to encourage students to support and participate in the
                            government. There is no visible <pb n="8" xml:id="d84-08" facs="d84-08"/>effort to train youth for political responsibility, however; in fact,
                            the government attempts to keep students from engaging in any political
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>In the wake of the 1968 demonstrations, the Shah launched a program of
                            reform for higher education. University chancellors were replaced
                            wholesale; an awareness of the need for change was instilled in
                            educators; plans were set forth for producing more graduates in
                            development fields and for increasing technical training; and students
                            were promised a greater voice "within reasonable limits" in university
                            affairs. The government is also attempting to improve and enlarge
                            enrollment, university facilities, and faculties and to establish a more
                            creative and relevant method of instruction. Progress is slow, however,
                            particularly when change is still fought by conservative elements within
                            the academic community.</p>
                        <p>Political and social pull—being a descendant of one of Iran's "1,000
                            families"—is still important in the rise to success, but less so than
                            before. More middle-class youth are attending universities, and with the
                            government's increasing emphasis on skill and technical competence, more
                            of them without political connections are now able to get jobs. Of
                            greatest impact, however, has been the increasing availability of
                            government jobs. Both high school and university graduates are employed
                            in large numbers in the Literacy, Health, and Development Corps.</p>
                        <p>Although the widely publicized educational reform program demonstrates
                            the government's willingness to use the carrot to quiet students, there
                            is little doubt that the stick would be employed without hesitation
                            should student unrest take political shape. There is some evidence, in
                            fact, of a dispute over how to handle restive students between the soft
                            liners in the Education Ministry and hard liners in the security
                            forces.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iranian Students Abroad</p>
                        <p>Iranian officials estimate that some 25,000 to 37,000 Iranians are
                            studying abroad, including 5,000 to 12,000 in the US. Surveys have shown
                            that many of the best do not return home because of better opportunities
                            abroad, while average students are likely to come back. Most of the
                            sizable number of dropouts and failures (only 50 percent of the Iranian
                            "students" in the US are thought to be actually enrolled in schools) get
                            nonprofessional jobs with good pay abroad and do not return to Iran.</p>
                        <p>A degree from a US or European university is considered far more
                            prestigious than one from an Iranian university, and many youths go to
                            fantastic lengths to study abroad. For example, private enterprises in
                            Iran sell admissions to small, often unaccredited universities in the US
                            to students who are unable to gain admission to better US schools.
                            Poorer students often seek education abroad because they are unable to
                            gain entrance to Iran's universities.</p>
                        <p>A small but vocal segment of Iranian students abroad (an estimated 500 of
                            those in the US), engage in active anti-Shah activities. They hold
                            meetings, issue sporadic publications, and make grandiose plans, but
                            their major activity is to harass the Shah when he travels. Anti-Shah
                            demonstrations, joined by radical students in the US, Germany, Austria,
                            and England, among other places, have been a major irritant to the Shah.
                            They have strained relations with host governments and have often led to
                            supersecrecy and extremely tight security measures during his trips.</p>
                        <p>The largest organizations of Iranian students abroad—the Iranian Students
                            Association in the US and the Confederation of Iranian Students in
                            Europe—appear to be a conglomeration of Communist sympathizers, National
                            Front-oriented leftists, middle-ofthe-roaders, and religiously oriented
                            rightists. <pb n="10" xml:id="d84-10" facs="d84-10"/>They have no
                            ideological cohesiveness; only opposition to the Shah unites them. The
                            leftists, who tend to be more active, almost always assume control but
                            do not necessarily reflect the attitudes of the majority. Most of the
                            funds apparently come from membership dues. Those who are in the
                            forefront of anti-Shah activities are well known to Iranian authorities
                            and most of them find it impossible to return to Iran.</p>
                        <p>The government is also concerned by the so-called "brain drain" problem.
                            During the past few years, it has initiated a number of steps calculated
                            to lure overseas residents back—draft exemptions, the promise of good
                            jobs in government and private industry, and active recruiting or
                            teaching jobs at Iranian universities. The regime may also be making it
                            more difficult Iranians to go abroad in the first place.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Long View</p>
                        <p>There will probably be no dramatic changes in student attitudes over the
                            next ten years, assuming that the Shah's economic development programs
                            continue to provide challenging employment to increasing numbers of
                            university graduates. It is also unlikely that many Iranian students
                            will risk political activism while economic and social advancement
                            appears possible. Nevertheless, as long as political activity is
                            proscribed—and it is likely to be for as long as the Shah is in
                            power—the regime will probably not win wholehearted student support, and
                            resentment of its authoritarianism, however benevolent, will pervade
                            university life.</p>

                        <p> Dick Helms has sent you the attached memo [<hi rend="italic">text not

                        <p>Essentially Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            has [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] convey his concern
                            that certain bureaucratic turnings in Washington might undercut what the
                            Shah believes is a commitment by the President to provide a substantial
                            number of F4 and C130 aircraft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> writes out of his concern for the continuation of
                            our unique intelligence collection facilities in Iran [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>].The bureaucratic state of play is that
                            the Defense Department has asked the intelligence community to do a
                                <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> on the military threat to
                            Iran. This is somewhat like the Arab-Israeli situation in that the
                            visible threat is probably not great enough to justify as much hardware
                            as the Shah wants. However, the Shah is building not just a military
                            establishment suited to the threat, but a deterrent as well.</p>
                        <p>An effort is already being made to broaden the framework of the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> so that it will not turn out to be so
                            limited as to make it more difficult for us to operate from a broader
                            view of the situation. However, the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> by itself obviously will not make policies. The
                            decision on the number of planes to be sold will be made over the next
                            couple of months, and we will have a crack at it in the normal
                            bureaucratic machinery. Essentially, this decision will be made with the
                            President's general commitment in mind, although not perhaps without
                            some argument.</p>
                        <p>In passing on the attached memo, therefore, I simply want to reassure you
                            that I am on top of this problem and will continue to work — along with
                            Joe Sisco — to make sure that the President's general promise is not
                            undercut.</p>

                        <p>The broader problem with Iran, of course, is that as long as the military

                            Ambassador is greatly concerned. While this may seem a somewhat unusual
                            channel, the Ambassador wished to [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] to ensure that I became fully aware of the
                            background of his thinking on a developing situation which could
                            seriously affect our very considerable intelligence interests in
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador is certain that the Shah believes he has a firm commitment
                            from the President to permit the Shah to purchase some 73 F-4 aircraft
                            and about 30 C-130 aircraft in addition to the number of these aircraft
                            already on hand or on order for the Iranian Air Force. The Shah also
                            discussed the need for this larger amount of aircraft with the
                            Secretaries of State and Defense, neither of whom expressed any
                            reservations.</p>
                        <p>At the present time the Department of Defense is re-evaluating Iran's
                            defense needs, and joint State- Defense cables to Embassy Teheran put in
                            question the validity of the Shah's judgement as to his aircraft
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>There can understandably be any number estimates and opinions as to how
                            many of what kind of aircraft Iran requires — depending among other
                            things upon the view taken of the importance of U.S. interests in the
                            Persian Gulf and of the role Iran can reasonably <pb n="4" xml:id="d85-04" facs="d85-04"/>be expected to play in helping to
                            preserve them. Whatever these opinions may be, however, the Ambassador
                            believes that the determining factor is the Shah's conviction that he
                            has in fact a commitment from the President, and his belief that, to
                            seem to renege would raise serious doubts in the Shah's mind as to the
                            wisdom of continuing to regard the U.S. as a reliable partner in the
                            effort to achieve and maintain stability in the Gulf area.</p>
                        <p>Our intelligence collection facilities in Iran [<hi rend="italic">text
                                not declassified</hi>] are unique, and their presence rests very
                            directly on the Shah's support. Any action which would undermine the
                            Shah's confidence in the consistency of U.S. policy would inevitably
                            have an erosive effect on this vital intelligence relationship. For this
                            reason, as well as the total U.S. concern over the Persian Gulf area, I
                            suggest we reconsider the need at this time for a major re-evaluation of
                            Iran's defense needs, particularly as this re-evaluation process is
                            certain to become a substantive, and adverse, factor in Iranian-U.S.
                            relations.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">SCOPE NOTE</p>
                        <p>This estimate deals primarily with Iranian foreign policy over the next
                            several years, the place military forces have in that policy, the
                            likelihood of hostilities between Iran and its neighbors, and some
                            implications of these matters for the US, including the question of arms
                            sales.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. The Shah is determined to ensure for Iran a position of power and
                            leadership in the Persian Gulf after the British withdrawal. He is
                            deeply concerned that radical Arab regimes, supported by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, may in time threaten Iran's
                            interests in the Gulf. However, Arab disunity and dislike of external
                            direction almost certainly will prevent the formation of an effective
                            radical Arab military coalition against Iran. Moreover, an overly active
                            Soviet policy of support for radical Arab movements against Iranian
                            interests could jeopardize the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                            currently satisfactory relations with Iran.</p>
                        <p>B. The Shah regards a modern, well-equipped military establishment as
                            essential to maintain and further Iranian interests in the Gulf, to
                            deter hostile moves by Iraq, and to assure Iranian egress from the Gulf.
                            The existence of a large military force will help him to get the
                            cooperation of conservative Arab rulers in opposing the spread, of
                            radical doctrines and forces in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>C. The physical integrity of Iran is not threatened by any of its Persian
                            Gulf neighbors. Iran is on good terms with all but Iraq. Hostilities
                            between the two are clearly possible, but the Shah's armed forces are
                            substantially larger and better-trained than those of Iraq. What the
                            Shah fears most in the Gulf is the growth of Arab radicalism-seeking the
                            overthrow of traditional rule there-with consequent harm <pb n="4" xml:id="d86-04" facs="d86-04"/>to Iranian interests. Should a
                            radical movement succeed in establishing itself in one of the smaller
                            states, he would almost certainly try to contain or unseat it by
                            clandestine means, but might use overt force as a last resort. A
                            unilateral use of force by the Shah would virtually compel even
                            conservative Feisal to support fellow Arabs, and this wouLd upset both
                            Gulf stability and the Shah's designs for cooperation of conservative
                            Gulf States under his leadership.</p>
                        <p>D. The Shah considers US willingness to provide the arms he wants as
                            evidence of this country's high regard for him and for his policies. He
                            would probably settle for a substantial part of the total number he
                            wants, hoping to get approval for more at a later date. If, however, he
                            felt that US explanations implied a prolonged delay or an unwillingness
                            to meet his needs, he would almost certainly turn to other Western
                            sources-probably France in the first instance. If US rebuffs or
                            deferrals of his arms requests should convince the Shah that the US was
                            no longer responsive to his needs, he would conclude the US was
                            downgrading its relations with Iran. Consequently, he would readjust
                            Iranian policies in the direction of: closer ties with certain West
                            European states, a more accommodating attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, resistence to US advice on
                            international issues, probably increased pressures on US oil interests,
                            and possibly termination of US special facilities and military
                            overflight rights.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. THE DOMESTIC SETTING</p>
                        <p>1. The successes of the Shah's program of social reform over the last
                            five years or so-the "white revolution"-and Iran's notable progress in
                            economic development have given the Shah great confidence that he is
                            master of his own house. It has also given many Iranians more confidence
                            in their country and its future. Shaking off an earlier insecurity and
                            hesitancy, the Shah has become a confident and purposeful leader. No
                            major-and very few minor-decisions are made without his approval. Behind
                            the façade of a parliament, he appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers
                            as he pleases. Domestically, his ambitious plans involve far-reaching
                            economic and social changes, e.g., land reform, industrialization, and
                            wide-scale education. The country is governed through a large
                            bureaucracy which is, within limits imposed by inertia and inefficiency,
                            responsive to the Shah's wishes.</p>
                        <p>2. In addition to the civilian bureaucracy (one out of six Iranians
                            employed outside agriculture works for the government), the Shah has the
                            support of armed forces numbering 183,000, a 67,000-man gendarmerie, and
                            an extensive policem <pb n="5" xml:id="d86-05" facs="d86-05"/>and
                            security apparatus. The Shah takes particular care to keep his officer
                            corps content, mostly through the provision of extensive perquisites in
                            the way of salaries, housing, and the like. Supplying the armed forces
                            with sophisticated weapons is an additional, but apparently not
                            critical, element in keeping them loyal.</p>
                        <p>3. There are still a number of Iranians who disagree with the Shah's
                            policies or who desire a share in power, but no organized opposition of
                            any consequence exists. The elements that formed the bulk of Mossadeq's
                            supporters in the early 1950s, including the Tudeh (Communists), have
                            either been cowed or drawn into the government's programs, which now
                            incorporate almost all the social demands of the old opposition-though
                            not the political ones-they once made. The conservative Muslim clergy
                            resent the way the Shah dominates or ignores them, yet they appear to be
                            able to do little more than grumble. However, there have been
                            assassination attempts on the Shah-the most recent in 1965; should he
                            die, through assassination or accident, there is no single person able
                            to wield the power he does, nor would the system permit devolution of
                            authority. The Shah would probably be succeeded, as provided by law, by
                            the Queen as regent for the minor son of the Shah. The regency would
                            likely be supported by the military leaders, but would be notably less
                            effective than the present regime.</p>
                        <p>4. One of the principal factors in the success of the Shah's rule has
                            been Iran's booming economy, which has grown at an annual average rate
                            of 9 percent since 1963. Oil has led this growth and has provided the
                            money to stimulate growth in almost all other parts of the economy.
                            Construction has grown at an annual average rate of 15 percent,
                            industrial output at about 12 percent, and agriculture (which provides a
                            quarter of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) has grown at about 5
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>5. This rapid economic expansion, however, has been achieved at the cost
                            of serious balance of payments difficulties; the deficit in 1969/1970
                            was about $150 million. Foreign exchange earnings will probably rise at
                            about 17 percent annually for the next several years; nevertheless the
                            annual balance of payments deficit will reach about $350 million by 1973
                            if import growth continues at the pace of recent years.</p>
                        <p>6. About 10 percent of Iran's annual foreign exchange expenditure of $2.1
                            billion is for military purposes. It cannot pay for both military
                            procurement and civilian imports at levels specified ' in existing
                            programs without significantly increasing its already heavy debt burden.
                            The Shah thus already faces a choice between military and civilian goals
                            and will probably opt to cut non-military imports, including inputs to
                            further industrial growth, thereby causing a moderate slowing in
                            economic growth from the 1969/1970 level of 9 percent. A windfall of
                            several hundred million dollars from new oil agreements would reduce the
                            difference between existing expenditure plans and currently anticipated
                            income, but it would not close the gap.</p>

                        <p>7. For well over a century, Iran was an arena in which larger powers
                            contested for influence. Up to about 1945, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Russia were the principal contestants. As British
                            power declined after World War II, the US took over some of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s role in Iran. However, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s past reputation as kingmaker in they
                            area, its ownership of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and since 1954 of
                            40 percent of the Iran Oil Consortium, and its position as guardian of
                            the smaller states of the Persian Gulf have continued to give Britain
                            considerable influence. During the past 10 years, however, Iran has made
                            considerable progress in emerging from the shadow of the great powers.
                            This change has been made possible by massive oil revenues, which
                            relieved Iran of the need for foreign economic and military assistance,
                            by the changing pattern of relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and by the Shah's emergence as a
                            confident powerful autocrat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan</p>
                        <p>8. Iranian relations with Turkey and Pakistan have long been very good;
                            the three have been members of the Western-sponsored <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> alliance since 1955. In recent
                            years, the three states, wishing to be less dependent on Western
                            guidance, formed a regional cooperative organization (RCD) to deal with
                            projects of mutual concern. For all practical purposes, there are no
                            matters of contention between Iran and either of these two neighbors.
                            Iranian relations with Afghanistan are less close than those with Turkey
                            and Pakistan. Most of what is now Afghanistan was once ruled by Persia,
                            but the Sunni Muslim Afghans broke away well over a century ago in
                            protest at Iranian Shia Muslim rule. Although relations between the two
                            states have from time to time deteriorated, e.g., over the location of
                            borders and the division of the Helmand River waters, these disputes are
                            not of great moment. For some years now Iranian-Afghan relations have
                            been smooth if somewhat distant.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. The Arab States</p>
                        <p>9. In the Shah's mind, Iran's foreign problems, aside from its relations
                            with the larger powers, really center in the Arab region to the west,
                            especially the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq. The Shah has no use for the
                            radical republican socialist movements-exemplified by Baathist Iraq and
                            by NASSER-which have appeared in the Arab world in recent years. Iran's
                            problems with the Arabs are complicated by a collision of Persian and
                            Arab nationalisms. There are also ethnic, religious, and linguistic
                            minorities along Iran's western border. The principal oil-producing
                            areas of Iran lie in Khuzistan, an area with a large Arabic-speaking
                            population which was ruled by an autonomous Arab family until the
                            mid-1920s. The Baathists in particular claim this area as part of the
                            Arab homeland. About half of Iraq's population is Shia Muslim, and it
                            has very close ties to the Shia community which is the majority of
                            Iran's population; the Iranians have a protective feeling about their
                            Iraqi co-religionists.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d86-07" facs="d86-07"/>
                        <p>10. The Shah cares relatively little who runs the Arab states of the
                            Gulf, as long as they do not challenge his pre-eminence, are not
                            hospitable to radicals and revolutionaries, and are responsive to
                            Iranian security objectives. Nevertheless, he does view physical control
                            of certain locations as the key to stability in the Gulf. Thus, he wants
                            control of the tiny islands of the Tunbs and Abu Musa on the grounds
                            that forces hostile to him might physically seize these islands and
                            control entry to and exit from the Gulf. Control of the islands also
                            involves conflicting Iranian and Arab oil claims. He recognizes that too
                            heavy a hand could be counterproductive, and has indicated that he will
                            not press the sovereignty issue so long as Iran obtains effective
                            control of these islands. If such an arrangement is not worked out
                            before the British withdrawal, the Shah will exert increasing pressure
                            on the tiny Trucial states which claim them, and in the last resort
                            would probably occupy the islands by force.</p>
                        <p>11. The Saudis and the Iranians have cooperated fairly well in the Gulf
                            recently, although Iranian pretensions occasionally grate on the Saudis.
                            The Iranians have also irritated Kuwait from time to time by assuming an
                            attitude of superiority. The present Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian regimes,
                            however, recognize Iran as a conservative government whose interest in
                            the stability of the Gulf generally coincides with their own. Neither
                            Kuwait nor Saudi Arabia is likely to challenge Iranian efforts to play a
                            pre-eminent role in Gulf security, for example, by naval patrols, so
                            long as Iran respects territorial waters and agreements on undersea oil
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>12. Iranian relations with Iraq have been antagonistic in recent years.
                            The Iranians have unilaterally denounced the treaty of 1937 which
                            extends Iraqi jurisdiction to the low water mark on the Iranian side of
                            the Shaat-al-Arab instead of placing the boundary essentially on the
                            shipping channel. The treaty requires shipping for Abadan and
                            Khorramshahr to transit Iraqi waters. The Shah believes that the
                            revolutionary regimes in Baghdad threaten his interests, and he has
                            actively opposed them. For instance, he has supported Kurdish rebels in
                            Iraq extensively over the past seven or eight years. This support has
                            involved direct military aid, cash subventions, and some haven on the
                            Iranian side of the border for Kurdish rebels. At the same time, the
                            Shah prefers to keep potentially troublesome Kurdish leaders occupied
                            outside Iran, which also has a Kurdish minority. The Iranians were
                            considerably annoyed when the Kurds accepted the Baghdad government's
                            proposals for a cease-fire and settlement in March 1970, but Tehran
                            maintains contact with Kurdish leaders against the day when fighting may
                            start again.</p>
                        <p>13. It seems likely that Iraqi-Iranian relations will remain poor, at
                            least as long as the present Baath government is in power in Baghdad.
                            The Baathist regime will continue to use the party and the state
                            apparatuses to further Iraq's aims of replacing of traditional rulers in
                            the Gulf with revolutionary governments, and, as far as possible, to
                            exclude Iran from Gulf affairs. The Baath groups in Bahrain, Kuwait, Abu
                            Dhabi and a few other principalities are likely from time to time to
                            attract Iran's attention. The Iranians and the Iraqis continue <pb n="8" xml:id="d86-08" facs="d86-08"/>to support the activity of political
                            exiles from the other country. For example, an Iranian-supported group
                            tried to oust the Baath regime in January 1970. The Iraqis, for their
                            part, continue to call for the "liberation" of Khuzistan, which they
                            call Arabistan. Especially since Iraq became heavily involved in the
                            Arab-Israeli dispute, however, these endeavors have been largely
                            rhetorical. Nevertheless, the Shah is seriously concerned about Iraqi
                            pretensions to Khuzistan.</p>
                        <p>14. In the past, NASSER had ambitions to extend his country's political
                            influence into the Persian Gulf, and he may well entertain thoughts of
                            making trouble for the local rulers there at some time in the future.
                            Egypt now has neither the time nor the resources to devote to such a
                            task in so distant an area; the Israelis are Egypt's pressing problem.
                            NASSER is also inhibited from involvement in the Gulf area by the fact
                            that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia supply 76 percent of the $250 million
                            annual subsidy which is of great importance to the Egyptian economy. For
                            the present, he is not likely to risk offending these donors by
                            adventuring in the Gulf. In any case, other persons and parties now
                            present alternatives, which have some appeal to young would-be
                            revolutionaries in eastern Arabia. The Shah deeply distrusts NASSER's
                            aims, however, and fears that a detente in the Arab-Israeli dispute
                            might give NASSER a chance to renew pressures in the Persian Gulf
                            region.</p>
                        <p>15. Iran has maintained good relations with Israel for many years, but,
                            out of regard for the sensibilities of conservative Arab associates, the
                            Shah has kept his Israeli association fairly discreet. His concern to
                            maintain good relations with King Feisal and the Amir of Kuwait, for
                            example, will continue to set limits to public displays of intimacy with
                            Israel. Yet, Iran is the major source of oil for the pipeline across
                            Israel from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterranean, and the two
                            governments get along quite well and cooperate in certain quiet
                            ways.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Western Europe</p>
                        <p>16. The Shah maintains good relations with the principal countries of
                            Western Europe. The Iranians and the British successfully worked out an
                            independent status for Bahrain, thus defusing a potentially serious
                            post-UK withdrawal problem. There is a good chance that the British, who
                            wish interstate relations in the Gulf to be as orderly as possible in
                            anticipation of their withdrawal, will also work out an amicable
                            arrangement allowing Iran control over the islands of Tunbs and Abu
                            Musa, which it claims. The Shah views the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, along with France and perhaps Germany, as potential
                            sources of arms if he cannot purchase what he wants from the US.</p>

                        <p>17. Iran and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have brought their
                            relations to a fairly normal level over the past eight years. The
                            situation today contrasts sharply with the state of bitter hostility
                            which prevailed in the late 1940s and much of the 1950s. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Iran have exchanged many
                            high-level visits; the Soviets have extended $525 million in economic
                            credits, of which about $120 million has been drawn. The <pb n="9" xml:id="d86-09" facs="d86-09"/>major projects involved are a natural
                            gas pipeline which is due to begin operation in late 1970 and a steel
                            mill in Isfahan. Iran has also contracted for $235 million worth of
                            military equipment from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            mostly personnel carriers, trucks, and artillery.</p>
                        <p>18. The Soviets have attempted to build good relations with Iran and
                            other states along its border which are allied to the West. At the same
                            time, it has courted the "progressive" Arab regimes and become the major
                            arms supplier for Iraq, Syria, and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> places
                            considerable importance on expanding its presence in the Persian Gulf,
                            where it has limited diplomatic representation and few political assets.
                            Showing the flag by Soviet naval vessels is certain to increase in the
                            years ahead. However, an overly active policy of support for Arab
                            radical movements in the Gulf or undertaking independent conspicuous
                            political or military efforts there could jeopardize the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s currently good, if not overly
                            cordial, relations with Iran. The Soviets would therefore prefer not to
                            be put in a position of having to choose between Iran on the one hand
                            and Iraq and the radical Arabs on the other. This consideration will set
                            limits on how aggressive the Soviets will be in pursuing their policy in
                            the Gulf in the next few years.</p>
                        <p>19. The Iranians continue to regard the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>SSR with concern, recalling Soviet efforts to create puppet
                            regimes in Iran during and after World War II and active support
                            thereafter for the Communist Tudeh movement. The Shah takes considerable
                            pains to avoid Soviet military and economic aid in areas he considers
                            critical, e.g., sophisticated weapons and training. He is suspicious of
                            historic Russian designs on Iran and desires for direct access to the
                            Persian Gulf. He believes, however, that good Iranian-Soviet relations
                            offer benefits to Iran and that he can control any Soviet presence and
                            subversive activities in his country.</p>
                        <p>20. Since the early 1950s, the Shah has considered the US to be Iran's
                            principal foreign supporter. By 1967, Iran had outgrown its dependence
                            on US economic and military assistance and, while it continued to look
                            to the US for advice and weapons, it became substantially less ready to
                            accept guidance. This has been particularly the case in the field of
                            weapons procurement. In the 1950s, Iranian military programs were
                            designed with the confrontation of the cold war in mind. More recently,
                            the Shah has emphasized that he wants to buy arms to protect Iran and
                            the Gulf from radical Arab revolutionary forces. In 1968, the US
                            undertook, subject to annual Congressional approval, to provide Iran
                            credit up to $100 million annually for five years for the purchase of
                            arms. Purchases under these credit arrangements, together with earlier
                            arms procurement, aim at modernizing and streamlining Iran's Armed
                            Forces. This process is well along; Iran has over 300 M-60 tanks, 31
                            F-4s (and 32 more on order), and nearly 100 F-5s. (See Table at Annex
                            for details.) In April 1970 the Shah was informed that the US was ready
                            to examine further military needs with him and possibly make new
                            financing arrangements on the basis of this examination.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. THE SHAH'S FOREIGN POLICY GOALS</p>
                        <p>21. The Shah is acutely conscious of Iran's great past and is determined
                            to set his country on the road to a great future. He is determined to
                            ensure for Iran a position of power and leadership to which he believes
                            it is entitled on the basis of its history and standing in the region.
                            The Shah sees the British withdrawal from the Gulf as a development
                            which gives Iran an opportunity to restore its historic position in the
                            Gulf, but which also contains dangers of turmoil.</p>
                        <p>22. Considerations of this sort underlie the Shah's military and foreign
                            policy. He wants Iran to be on good terms with its neighbors, if
                            possible. He has no major territorial ambitions; save as noted below, he
                            accepts-as do almost all Iranians-the country's boundaries as they were
                            determined by wars and treaties in the 18th and 19th centuries. He has,
                            for example, given up Iranian claims to Kuwait and Bahrain. However,
                            there are possible points of friction with Iraq on such matters as the
                            boundary in the Shaat-al-Arab, and with some Arab states on seabed
                            petroleum rights in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>23. The Shah has long been concerned that Arab radicals present a threat
                            to Iran. He has seen a succession of conservative and monarchial Arab
                            governments replaced by military regimes espousing socialism,
                            anti-imperialism, and friendship for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which has provided arms and other aid to them. These
                            regimes have, in varying degrees, extended help to like-minded elements
                            in "non-liberated" Arab states. The Shah appears to believe that,
                            perhaps over an extended time, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will be able to dominate a number of these regimes and manipulate them
                            against Iran's interests, especially in the Gulf, and ultimately against
                            Iran itself. He views any new radical regime as a potential adherent to
                            these "anti-Iranian" forces.</p>
                        <p>24. The Shah's worries are not without justification, but they are
                            exaggerated. The Soviets and the Arab radicals are indeed working for
                            "progressive" regimes in the Middle East. Each addition to the radical
                            side-and there probably will be a few more in the course of the
                            1970s-further isolates the remaining traditional rulers. Yet, there are
                            several factors which militate against a Soviet-radical Arab campaign
                            against Iran. First, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            continuing to improve its political relations with Iran by government to
                            government dealings. Second, the Arab radicals are deeply split; there
                            are the Nasserists, two bitterly antagonistic Baath Parties, two Arab
                            Nationalists Movements, and a variety of local revolutionary groups.
                            Cooperation among these radical Arab states and movements is decreasing,
                            even with regard to Israel. Communist parties in several Arab countries,
                            e.g., Iraq and Syria, are divided. Third, except where their interests
                            run parallel, the Arab radicals have shown little disposition to accept
                            Soviet direction. Fourth, most Arab radicals have so far shown little
                            interest in Iran, even though they regard the Shah as an imperialist
                            agent and a friend of Israel.</p>
                        <p>25. In the Persian Gulf, Iraq and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will, to some extent, be carrying out parallel
                            activities. The Soviets are likely to make the "correct" diplomatic
                            moves, naval visits, and the like, while the Iraqi Baathists promote
                            their revolutionary <pb n="11" xml:id="d86-11" facs="d86-11"/>interests.
                            The Baathists will be willing to cooperate with other revolutionary
                            forces in the Gulf, including the Communists, as long as such
                            cooperation seems likely to further Baath interests. Iraq is not likely
                            to help in promoting the fortunes of other Arab radical movements or of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at its own expense. Moreover,
                            Baghdad would resent Soviet efforts to direct Iraqi activities in the
                            Gulf.</p>
                        <p>26. The Shah wants modern sophisticated armed forces to establish
                            military superiority over neighboring Arab countries, particularly Iraq,
                            in order to deter present or potential hostile forces from any notions
                            of armed adventure in Iran, and to promote Iranian interests in the
                            Gulf. In recent years, he has emphasized improvement of his air force,
                            and to a lesser extent his navy. Iran's Armed Forces are already larger
                            and better equipped than any the Iranians are at all likely to
                            fight-notably that of Iraq. The additional aircraft which the Shah
                            wishes to purchase- about 70 F-4s and 30 C-130s-will make a dramatic
                            increase in certain of Iran's capabilities. If he gets these C-130s,
                            Iran would have the capability to airlift over 4,000 combat soldiers at
                            one time to any likely trouble spot in the Gulf region. Forces of this
                            nature would permit Iran to conduct military operations in, say, Saudi
                            Arabia in response to a request for help against insurrection.</p>
                        <p>27. Iran's neighbors are probably not yet aware of just how impressive
                            Iran's forces may become by the mid-1970s-even without these additional
                            purchases. The conservative Arab rulers in the Gulf have and are likely
                            to continue good relations with Iran; in any case, there is little they
                            can do militarily about Iran's preponderant force. The Iraqis, who have
                            built up their forces considerably in recent years but are still
                            militarily inferior to Iran, are likely to get quite concerned when they
                            realize the levels of air power toward which the Iranians are building.
                            Baghdad will probably believe that the Iranians are doing so with
                            operations against Iraq in mind and will almost certainly seek to add to
                            its own forces.</p>
                        <p>28. Hostilities between Iraq and Iran, though not likely, are clearly
                            possible. In 1969 and in early 1970, Iraqi and Iranian forces mobilized
                            to a degree and faced each other across the border in the south. This
                            could happen again, and an incident might touch off fighting-e.g.,
                            border skirmishes, exchanges of artillery fire, and occasional air
                            raids. Iraq will, however, be particularly inhibited from initiating
                            provocative actions as long as about a fifth of its army remains in
                            Jordan and Syria.</p>
                        <p>29. Should large-scale hostilities between Iraq and Iran take place, the
                            major scene of action would be along the southern half of the two
                            countries' common border. The Iraqi Army has not reached the border in
                            the mountainous north for 10 years, thanks to the Kurdish rebellion. The
                            Iranian Armed Forces are substantially larger than those of Iraq,
                            although the two sides are about evenly matched in numbers of such
                            weapons as tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, and aircraft.
                            The Iraqis, despite their nearly 10 years of warfare <pb n="12" xml:id="d86-12" facs="d86-12"/>against Kurdish guerrillas, do not
                            seem to have developed much spirit and dash. Their senior officer corps
                            has been decimated several times by political purges.</p>
                        <p>30. An Iraqi attempt to invade Iran would in all probability be an
                            advance on the Abadan- Khorramshahr region in the south or possibly one
                            on Kermanshah in the center of the border. The Iranians should be able
                            to deploy forces of at leastlequal magnitude against those of Iraq. The
                            Iranian Air Force appears superior to Iraq's since it has about half
                            again as many qualified pilots and better aircraft, although the Iraqis
                            have had experience in ground support operations in the Kurdish war.
                            Each side could do some damage to the other, e.g., by bombing or
                            shelling oil installations; both Abadan and the Iraqi oil ports are
                            close to the border. It seems likely that both sides would rapidly find
                            that the complexity of their equipment caused high breakdown rates and
                            that their logistics was inadequate to support an ambitious advance.
                            Hence, any fighting would probably not go on for an extended period.</p>
                        <p>31. Syria or Egypt would have virtually no capability to support Iraq in
                            such a war as long as they actively confront the Israelis. Should a
                            settlement be reached with Israel, Syria and Egypt could move some
                            troops to Iraq. Syria and Egypt could also deploy aircraft to assist
                            Iraq. However, a major change in the relations among the three would
                            have to take place before Syria and Egypt would contemplate such moves.
                            The Syrian Baathists despise their Baghdad colleagues. The Iraqi
                            Baathists despise the Syrians. NASSER distrusts both, and the feeling is
                            reciprocated. An effective coalition of radical Arab states against Iran
                            is virtually impossible in the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>32. Hostilities with other countries seem remote indeed. The very close
                            ties that Iran enjoys with Turkey and Pakistan preclude hostilities
                            involving these countries. We see no likelihood that Iran and
                            Afghanistan would see any reason to go to war in the foreseeable future.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could of course overwhelm Iran
                            with ease. Clearly, however, Soviet policy with non-Communist neighbors
                            is to maintain good state to state relations and to promote Soviet
                            influence through trade, aid, and other conventional instruments of
                            statecraft. Hostilities beween the two are probable only in the context
                            of general hostilities between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in this area. Should either Kuwait or Saudi Arabia
                            fall under the domination of a radical regime, relations with Iran would
                            almost certainly deteriorate. But neither country has sufficient
                            military force to pose any threat to Iran, nor could either build such a
                            force for many years. Even under a radical government, neither is likely
                            to receive external assistance sufficient to reverse this situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. IMPLICATIONS</p>
                        <p>33. The existence of a stable government with a large military force will
                            help the Shah get the cooperation of conservative Arab rulers in
                            opposing the spread of radical doctrines and forces in the Gulf. Yet,
                            there are formidable obstacles in the way of an enduring cooperation
                            between Iran and these rulers. There is a basic, longstanding antagonism
                            between Persians and Arabs, and <pb n="13" xml:id="d86-13" facs="d86-13"/>even the conservative Arabs in the Gulf are likely to view a
                            projection of Iranian power in this area with some suspicion. At
                            present, the Shah and Feisal are determined to cooperate, but this
                            disposition is essentially a personal matter on the part of the two
                            rulers rather than a firmly grounded matter of national policy of the
                            two states. In any case, cooperation between the two is a prerequisite
                            but not a guarantee of stability in the Gulf. The means by which the
                            Shah seeks to make Iranian power felt in the Gulf could set Iranian and
                            conservative Arabs at loggerheads. Feisal might help the Shah if the
                            latter moved covertly, but should radical turmoil break out in one of
                            the shakier mini-states of the Gulf, for example, and the Shah were to
                            intervene openly, the need to show Arab solidarity would probably compel
                            Feisal to denounce Iranian intrusion-even though his sympathies probably
                            would be against the radicals.</p>
                        <p>34. Developments of this sort would cause some difficulties for the US,
                            which might find itself caught between two friendly states, both armed
                            with US weapons and both of major interest to US petroleum companies.
                            Even if matters do not reach such a stage, Iranian moves in the Gulf
                            could cause much Arab opinion to believe that the US is supporting
                            Iranian efforts, including those clearly directed against Arab
                            interests. Such a belief would have some adverse effect on relations
                            with the Arab world; the issue could become serious if Iran did use
                            force on the Arab side of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>35. Of more immediate concern is the issue of US-Iranian bilateral
                            relations, and particularly the Shah's desire for additional military
                            aircraft. He probably would settle for a substantial part of the total
                            number he wants, hoping to get approval for more at a later date. If,
                            however, he felt that US explanations implied a prolonged delay or an
                            unwillingness to meet his needs, he would almost certainly turn to other
                            Western sources-probably France in the first instance. He would be
                            reluctant, as he says, to complicate his air force's logistics by doing
                            so, and this consideration would cause him to delay for a time, while
                            trying to convince the US to give him greater satisfaction. He is
                            unlikely to turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for
                            military aircraft; he remains deeply suspicious that Russia has long
                            term subversive designs on his country, and he would not want the
                            Soviets to have access to his air force.</p>
                        <p>36. The Shah considers US willingness to sell him the arms he wants as
                            evidence of US support for his policies and for him personally. Since
                            the Shah views Iran's relationship with the US as extremely important,
                            deferral or even refusal of a particular request would not cause him to
                            make major alterations in the overall relationship unless he considered
                            this request essential. Yet, his suspicions that the US does not fully
                            appreciate him would increase. He would probably become correspondingly
                            resistant to US advice on future arms purchases and on Iranian policies
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>37. But if US rebuffs or deferrals of his arms requests should convince
                            the Shah that the US was no longer responsive to his needs, he would
                            conclude the US was downgrading its relations with Iran. Consequently,
                            he would readjust Iranian policies in the direction of: closer ties with
                            certain West European states, <pb n="14" xml:id="d86-14" facs="d86-14"/>a more accommodating attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, resistence to US advice on international issues,
                            probably increased pressures on US oil interests, and possibly
                            termination of US special facilities and military overflight rights.</p>

                            IRAQ</p>
                        <p>At the outset of hostilities with Iraq, Iran would be able to deploy 2
                            infantry divisions, 2 armored divisions, and 5 separate brigades. If
                            required the remaining 2 infantry divisions could be deployed within
                            24-72 hours. The Iranian Air Force would be able to deploy 8 tactical
                            fighter squadrons (5 F-5a/B, 2 F-4, 1 F-86). Logistics deficiencies,
                            although existing, would not be a significant factor in the defense of
                            Iran from Iraq. However, the Iranians would probably not be able to
                            support a major offensive mbvement into Iraq. Perhaps as much as an
                            infantry division would be kept for duty along the Soviet border east of
                            the Caspian, but, if required, most of this force could be deployed into
                            action against Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Although an Imperial Guard division is assigned security duty in Tehran,
                            only a brigade would be required for internal security during

                        <p>1. Fully endorse your remarks to <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> that attempts to whip up national sentiment
                            against oil companies would almost certainly be resented abroad and
                            would do nothing to improve Iran's credit rating. Indeed, if such
                            attempts were successful, as we assume they would be if instigated by
                            the Shah, we fear it possible that they could create a climate in which
                            the oil companies might carried only so far before counterreaction sets
                            in and they themselves are not without options. Quite frankly, we feel
                            we and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> have pushed the companies
                            about as far as they will go on the offtake question. As you know, the
                            pressure has been insistent and virtually unremitting for almost a
                            year.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d87-02" facs="d87-02"/>
                        <p>2. We assume that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is fully
                            conversant with the physical limitations the current tanker shortage
                            puts on any immediate, dramatic increase in Persian Gulf offtake. We
                            assume also that it recognizes that Iranian oil and Libyan oil are of
                            different qualities and therefore not interchangeable in meeting
                            specific European market requirements. We note also that offtake for the
                            first seven months of the current year as compared to the first seven
                            months of last year indicate an 11.2% increase for the Middle East
                            generally, a 12.5% increase by the Consortium and a 14.2% increase for
                            Iran. This compares with a decrease of 0.3% for Abu Dhabi. Nevertheless
                            you may assure the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that we will
                            continue to be alert to opportunities that may occur which would help
                            increase Iranian offtake and that we will urge the oil companies to act
                            on these opportunities when they occur.</p>
                        <p>3. We found your remarks about the need for Iran to tailor its security
                            and development needs to its financial cloth most timely and relevant.
                            They might bear repeating in the near <pb n="3" xml:id="d87-03" facs="d87-03"/>future. We were gratified at Hoveyda's response and
                            indications that he may have taken them to heart in cutting back and/or
                            stretching out some of the government's programs now underway or
                            contemplated. We hope that it is coming home to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that it has pretty well wrung out all
                            possible sources of external assistance be it the Consortium, special
                            deals with oil independents, the international financial community or
                            the US Government. Further pressures, therefore, are unlikely to result
                            in anything other than irritation and increased questioning of what Iran
                            itself is doing to restrict its expenditures to strictly essential
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>4. We appreciate fully the difficulties the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> faces in making hard judgments on this score.
                            Nevertheless, evidence that they are doing so will doubtless bolster the
                            confidence and faith of its friends as they continue to try and be
                            helpful. Certainly evidence of our good faith in this respect was
                            clearly demonstrated most recently by our <pb n="4" xml:id="d87-04" facs="d87-04"/>willingness to consider financing Iran's military
                            requests through the Eximbank because we appeared to be stymied on
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> legislation.</p>
                        <p>5. We are informing the British here of the general tone of the foregoing
                            and expect that they will be advising Ambassador WRIGHT in Tehran along
                            similar lines.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>For some time Iran has been pressing us for additional credits to fund
                            the military equipment which it wants to buy. In response to these
                            initiatives, Ex-Im Bank has decided that it would be willing to loan
                            Iran $120 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 instead of the
                            $100 million to which the bank had committed itself. Ex-Im is now
                            seeking State and Defense concurrence in a cable informing the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of this decision, and State has agreed
                            in principle.</p>
                        <p>We believe it is unwise, at this time, for the U. S. to offer to increase
                            Iran's credit for purchases of military equipment for the following
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. The requirement for $120 million is based on the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> acquirMg, inter alia, 32 F-4Es, in
                            addition to the 64 already purchased, and 30 C-130s. As you are aware,
                            no U.S. decision has yet been made on the sale of these additional
                            aircraft, which cannot easily be justified in terms of the threat Iran
                            faces. Notifying the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of US
                            willingness to loan $120 million would imply the decision has already
                            been made.</p>
                        <p>2. It appears that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has made a
                            firm decision to purchase 32 more F-4s but Iran is much less certain
                            that it can afford to buy the additional 41 F-4s included in the
                            recently signed Letter of Intent. We believe there is a strong
                            possibility that if Iran is informed it can have $120 million credit in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71, it will assume it can probably
                            get a similar amount annually over the next three or four years. (The
                            history of our dealings with the Shah suggests that this assumption is
                            fair.) The prospect of an additional $20 million per year over tht next
                            three or four years could well be the deciding factor in Iran's decision
                            to purchase the last 41 F-4s. Since we are not yet convinced that it
                            would be in the best interest of either Iran or the U. S. for Iran <pb n="2" xml:id="d88-02" facs="d88-02"/>to have an 8-squadron F-4 force
                            (128 aircraft), we do not believe that we should do anything to
                            encourage Iran to make a positive decision at this time.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> must convert the F-4 Letter of
                            Intent to a firm contract by 1 December 70 and has already signed,
                            without US approval, the C-130 contract. The US position on those
                            transactions must therefore be established by late October. We are
                            consulting with Systems Analysis and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>

                        <p>— The Shah is feuding once again with the consortium of oil companies and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> feels that
                            "the moment of truth" has come for the consortium and the Shah. The Shah
                            claims that the consortium continues to be totally unresponsive and
                            negative toward his proposals that they increase the amount of oil they
                            are lifting for sale in non-consortium markets. He had tried to be
                            reasonable and fair but the companies seemed to think that they owned
                            the oil and could push the host countries around. The Shah said that he
                            would make one final proposition to the consortium, which, if it did not
                            accept, would oblige him to seek legislative action — an action which
                            would be based on "United Nations papers that make clear that mineral
                            resources of a country belonged to the country itself rather than the
                            foreign exploiting companies”.</p>

                            of the Shah asked that the Shah's concerns on the consortium and on

                        </list>
                        <p>We are at a major decision point in our relations with the Shah of Iran
                            over his arms acquisition program. The Shah desires to purchase amounts
                            of military equipment that exceed the ability of his services to absorb,
                            lie far beyond his military requirements, and run the risk of
                            destabilizing the military balance in the Persian Gulf area. If we do
                            not acquiesce to the Shah's wishes, we may seriously damage the
                            currently close relationship with Iran. Our choice is, therefore,
                            between an unwise and possibly dangerous arms program, on the one hand,
                            and denial of the Shah's wishes and likely damage to our relationship
                            with Iran, on the other hand.</p>
                        <p>In order to meet force goals that the US has not yet endorsed, the Shah
                            is attempting to buy, largely on credit, an additional 73 F-4E, 4 RF-4E,
                            and 30 C-130 aircraft. These aircraft would all be delivered to Iran by
                            the end of 1974 and would give the Imperial Iranian Air Force (<gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss>) an operational inventory of
                            approximately 128 F-4D/Es, 4 RF-4Es, 96 F-5s, 16 RF-5s, and 50 C-130s.
                            (The <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> currently has 31 F-4Ds, 96
                            F-5s, RF-5s, and 21 C-130s, with an additional 32 F-4Es and 5 C-130s on
                            order and scheduled for delivery before the end of 1971.) The total cost
                            of the new aircraft purchase program would be approximately $500
                            million. The Shah also plans to buy other defense items that could bring
                            the total cost to some $800 million over the next four or five
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The following case can be made for meeting the Shah's request:</p>
                        <p>1. We would demonstrate our continued support for Iran and our
                            willingness to help build the military force that the Shah considers
                            necessary to meet contingencies in the Persian Gulf area after the
                            British withdrawal next year.</p>
                        <p>2. A military force of that size could deter overt Iraqi military
                            aggression against Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>3. If we refuse his request, the Shah may buy aircraft elsewhere, thereby
                            degrading Iran's logistic system and the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss>'s orientation toward the US.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d90-02" facs="d90-02"/>
                        <p>The following case can be made against meeting the request:</p>
                        <p>1. The threat to Iran does not require such a significant increase in
                            military power. A Special National Intelligence Estimate (<gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>) reaching this conclusion is attached
                            at Tab A. Although the Joint Staff now supports a force goal of 128 F-4
                            aircraft (Tab B), it does so on the basis of the same rationale used
                            last year to support a goal of 64. Systems Analysis considers the change
                            in the Joint Staff's opinion to be unwarranted and supports <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>'s assessment that the Shah's force
                            goals are excessive in view of the threat. (Tab C).</p>
                        <p>2. Although the Shah's goal for combat aircraft would probably not
                            provide Iran with quantitative superiority over Iraq, Iran's most likely
                            antagonist, it would provide qualitative superiority and almost
                            certainly lead Iraq to seek additional assistance from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, perhaps even in the form that Egypt
                            is currently receiving. We might therefore be faced with an arms race
                            nullifying any temporary improvement in Iran's security.</p>
                        <p>3. Subversion rather than aggression is the major threat to peace and
                            stability in Iran and the Persian Gulf area. The air force desired by
                            the Shah would not counter this threat. At the same time, the diversion
                            of Iranian resources to military rather than economic and social ends
                            could promote internal discontent and subversion.</p>
                        <p>4. An $800 million program of military purchases over the next five years
                            could have a damaging impact on the Iranian economy, since it would
                            absorb a significant portion of the funds available for importing
                            capital goods.</p>
                        <p>5. Purchase of such a large number of complex aircraft would severely
                            strain the meager base of technical personnel. We have already assigned
                            some eighty blue-suiters to assist in maintenance of present F-4s, an
                            arrangement we wish to terminate as quickly as possible. We can expect
                            requests for more rather than fewer blue-suiters.</p>
                        <p>6. The Shah has been seeking for some time to increase training spaces in
                            the US for his pilots, even though Iran already accounts for almost half
                            the spaces allotted to foreign trainees. We can expect additional
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>Because of the political importance of Iran to the US (area stability,
                            overflight rights, and intelligence facilities), we should meet at least
                            some of the Shah's postulated needs even though they cannot be justified
                            on purely military grounds. In fact, the Shah may not have made a final
                            decision on buying all 73 F-4Es, and funding problems together with
                            personnel constraints may lead him to restrict his 1970 F-4 buy to 32
                            (plus a few attrition aircraft). Indeed, Iran's funding request to the
                            EX-IM Bank mentioned only 32 F-4s.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d90-03" facs="d90-03"/>
                        <p>In light of these factors and the countervailing pressures for and
                            against this sale, I recommend that:</p>
                        <p>1. You approve the sale of 32 F-4Es plus up to 7 attrition aircraft, 4
                            RF-4Es, and 30 C-130s.</p>
                        <p>2. We make a vigorous attempt to dissuade the Shah from buying the last
                            increment of F-4s, perhaps by persuading him to substitute the pending
                            freedom fighter.</p>
                        <p>3. You be prepared to consider a follow-on request for additional F-4s if
                            we are unsuccessful in dissuading the Shah.</p>

                        <p>A related problem is the level of credit to be offered Iran by EX-IM. The
                            Bank has proposed a level of $120 million for Iran in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971, with a promise to consider
                            sympathetically a similar amount for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1972 and 1973. This level of credits would be required to meet
                            disbursements under the proposed sales package. I recommend that you
                            approve the EX-IM proposal.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Review Group has completed a
                            study of the Persian Gulf following withdrawal of British military
                            forces and termination of formal defense treaties and protectorate
                            responsibilities. Since the British never planned to withdraw their
                            political presence and since announcement of the revision of their
                            relationship has released local nationalist aspirations, the problem is
                            less one of filling a vacuum than of dealing with a readjustment of the
                            balance in the area.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem that this subject warrants discussion in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> at this time, but it does seem
                            desirable to describe the options considered and to seek your
                            concurrence in the general line of policy that is being followed. There
                            will be discussions soon with the Shah and the British about a base for
                            our Persian Gulf naval force after the British military leave, and plans
                            must be included in your next Budget for slightly increased diplomatic
                            representation and other activity. A longer paper reflecting the Review
                            Group discussions is at Tab B, but the options and decisions to be made
                            are summarized below.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                        <p>The central problem is that it is easy to recognize the potential for
                            instability in the Gulf and increased Soviet and radical exploitation,
                            but it is difficult to determine how the U. S. can best help minimize
                            the consequences.</p>
                        <p>While the Persian Gulf is important to U. S. allies and friends, its
                            potential instability seems relatively unresponsive to U.S. power. The
                            main evolution will come through political intrigue or subversion in
                            politically unprogressive and often inaccessible areas. Because <pb n="2" xml:id="d91-02" facs="d91-02"/>the main U.S. interest lies in
                            the interests of allies and in the area's relationship to the global
                            strategic balance and because U.S. power may not have significant impact
                            on evolution within the area itself, the problem is more one of devising
                            the best possible international framework for that evolution than it is
                            figuring out how the U. S. can influence it. Within the limitation of
                            that framework, though, it is important to determine what kind of U.S.
                            presence can be most constructive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Strategy</p>
                        <p>The Review Group went through the exercise of considering five distinct
                            strategy options:</p>
                        <p>1. assuming the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s role as protector
                            ourselves;</p>
                        <p>2. backing Iran as our "chosen instrument" to be keeper of stability in
                            the Gulf;</p>
                        <p>3. promoting Saudi-Iranian cooperation;</p>
                        <p>4. dealing directly with the new states of the lower Gulf; and</p>
                        <p>5. actively promoting a regional security pact.</p>
                        <p>The first and the last were ruled out as impractical, and the middle
                            three options are not really alternatives. The logical course seems to
                            be to marry those middle three. Our course then would be:</p>
                        <p>—to promote Saudi-Iranian cooperation as the mainstay of a stable
                            regional system but</p>
                        <p>—to recognize that Iran is in fact the preponderant power in the Gulf
                            and</p>
                        <p>—to do what we can to develop a working relationship with the new
                            political entities in the lower Gulf.</p>
                        <p>A Saudi-Iranian confrontation would increase instability, and both at
                            present recognize the importance of their cooperation. If a radical
                            regime were to take over in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. would have little
                            choice but to move closer to Iran—and there is no reason now not to go
                            on preparing Iran for that contingency. But as long as those two major
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d91-03" facs="d91-03"/>regional nations are trying
                            themselves to create the framework for political evolution, the U. S.
                            has every reason to support it.</p>
                        <p>As for an independent U. S. presence, the U. S. interest is two-fold:</p>
                        <p>—imaginative technical and educational assistance through governmental
                            and private programs can inject Western methods and relationships into
                            political and economic evolution;</p>
                        <p>—while the U.S. may not have plans for military involvement, now would
                            not seem the time to cut back the small U.S. naval force that operates
                            from Bahrain. This show of interest seems important vis-a-vis both the
                            regional entities and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that the British—despite revision of their formal
                            relationships—intend to remain active in the Gulf's political,
                            diplomatic and commercial affairs and in military supply and
                            training.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Decisions To Be Made Now</p>
                        <p>1. General U.S. strategy. While no precise decision is required now, it
                            would be helpful to have your general reaction to the strategy that is
                            now contemplated for the near term. I am doing a further study to look
                            at our longer term interests and objectives in the Gulf area. The
                            proposed short-term strategy will not foreclose any options for the
                            longer term.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you approve the general strategy outlined above for
                            the near term—promoting Saudi-Iranian cooperation while recognizing
                            Iran's preponderant power and developing a modest U.S. presence in the
                            new states.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Approve [RN] Other</p>
                        <p>2. The future U.S. naval presence. The small U. S. naval force (2
                            destroyers and a converted seaplane tender) is home-ported on Bahrain by
                            agreement with the British. The Bahrainis would like us to stay. The
                            British have offered us first refusal on some of their facilities (a
                            dock and a few small communications and storage shacks). They will need
                            to know soon whether the U.S. wants them to work out a transfer. We
                            should also sound out the Shah. There would be an argument against
                            introducing new forces, and the present force may not be welcome there
                            for a long time. But while most of our friends regard it as an important
                            sign of U.S. interest, it seems untimely to remove it.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d91-04" facs="d91-04"/>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you approve a decision in principle not to reduce
                            the U. S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf at this time unless further
                            exploration should prove it politically unacceptable to friends of the
                            U. S. in the area.</p>

                        <p>3. U. S. diplomatic and aid presence. One of the serious limitations on
                            U. S. ability to contribute to orderly evolution in the Gulf is that one
                            of our usual instruments of policy is not available. Capital assistance
                            is not needed by these oil-rich states. While they do need the technical
                            assistance relationship that usually goes with capital aid, we do not
                            now have a well-developed program for providing it to states with their
                            own financial resources. When asked for a plan for a U.S. presence in
                            the lower Gulf, State came back with a fairly conventional blueprint for
                            diplomatic posts. While modestly expanded diplomatic representation is
                            desirable, our main interest is in pressing the agencies to break new
                            ground in a serious effort to adapt our programs to meet the needs of an
                            area like this. Your foreign policy message to Congress last February
                            identified this problem. Some staff work has been done and the new
                            technical assitance institute would help. But a prod would be in
                            order.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you approve the general principle of a U. S.
                            diplomatic presence in the lower Gulf but instruct the Under Secretaries
                            Committee (1) to review plans for this presence to assure that it is
                            imaginatively adapted to the needs of this emerging area and (2) to
                            oversee the development of programs—emphasizing technical and
                            educational assistance, exchange, and effective use of private as well
                            as public resources—that can provide for a growing U.S. presence
                            consistent with the strategy of promoting regional responsibility for
                            stability.'</p>

                        <p>4. Arms sale policy. The British have been the traditional supplier of
                            arms and would like to remain a major supplier. The U. S. has reason to
                            want the British to remain in the business of military training and
                            supply. At the same time, Kuwait has approached us to buy some transport
                            aircraft, and there have been other feelers from some of the states in
                            the lower Gulf. The only logical way to deal with this would seem to be
                            to look at a few concrete cases to get a feel for the political and
                            legal problems involved rather than trying to make a decision in the
                            abstract.</p>

                            recommendation for you on outstanding requests for military supply and
                            that you withhold decision until it can be made on concrete cases.</p>

                        <p>I. The Situation After a century and a half of relative insulation from
                            major political conflict, the Persian Gulf today is vulnerable to
                            internal and external pressures. The instability of the several
                            conservative regimes, the disunity among them, the contagion of the
                            ideological conflict which infects the rest of the Middle East, and the
                            new possibility of great-power competition in the Gulf — these are all
                            potential sources of disruption which are exploitable by Arab radicals
                            and the Soviet Union. The question for U. S. policy is how to deal with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The problem arises because it appears certain that Britain will revise
                            its defense commitments, protectorate responsibilities, and virtually
                            all its military forces by the end of 1971. Eleven small Arab states in
                            the lower Gulf — Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the seven Trucial States, and
                            Muscat/Oman — will no longer enjoy this formal British protection or
                            tutelage, although the British intend to maintain a substantial
                            political presence.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Local Weakness and Disunity</p>
                        <p>Paradoxically, the prospect of British withdrawal has simultaneously
                            provided an incentive for regional unity and yet at the same time has
                            opened up a number of local quarrels which have lain dormant during the
                            period of British dominance. The nine small states on the threshold of
                            independence (Bahrain, Qatar, and the Trucial States) have yet to
                            determine whether they will join in a Federation of Arab Amirates
                                (<gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>), or else go their separate
                            untried ways. A federation might help keep their intramural disputes
                            contained and enhance their ability to police their internal security.
                            But the sheikhs are divided by territorial disputes (exacerbated by oil)
                            and by personal jealousies and mistrust. On their own, not all the
                            Sheikhs would have the competence to govern intelligently and maintain
                            order at home, let alone conduct a coherent foreign policy. Bahrain and
                            some others are quite vulnerable to radical pressures.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U. S. Interests</p>
                        <p>Our overall interest in the stability of the region embraces a number of
                            specific interests:</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d91-07" facs="d91-07"/>
                        <p>—Economic: Oil production and sales by 20 U.S. companies yield a net
                            balance of payments surplus of $1.5 billion. The Gulf provides 55% of
                            Western Europe's oil, 90% of Japan's, and 89% of the oil used by U.S.
                            forces in Southeast Asia. Britain's commercial involvement in the region
                            (the Sterling Area relation, and L200 million income from investments)
                            are crucial to the stability of the pound and therefore of the
                            international monetary system.</p>
                        <p>—Political: The spread of radicalism in the Gulf would alter the balance
                            within the Arab world. It might aggravate the Arab-Israeli conflict and
                            would almost certainly increase the prospect for tension between Iran
                            and the Arabs. Soviet political penetration would affect the East-West
                            geopolitical balance (e. g., by increasing Soviet pressure on Iran and
                            Turkey and — although there is debate over how this would work out in
                            practice — by increasing the potential for Soviet control over
                            disposition of Persian Gulf oil.</p>
                        <p>—Military: The U. S. has communications and intelligence facilities in
                            Iran, and overflight and landing privileges in Iran. and Saudi Arabia
                            which provide an air corridor to South and Southeast Asia. A small U. S.
                            naval force (<gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>),
                            home-ported on Bahrain, enjoys refueling and port-call privileges in
                            much of the region. The intelligence facilities are judged to be
                            extremely important now [text not declassified] The longer range
                            military significance of a U.S. naval presence and overflight rights has
                            two aspects: (1) They are aspects of an overall U.S. presence, more
                            important now for political than for military reasons. (2) With
                            increasing naval and perhaps strategic Soviet interest in the Indian
                            Ocean, they are of possible military value as a base for a presence, the
                            precise nature of which it is difficult to foresee now.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Involvement</p>
                        <p>Our main worry in the Gulf, as elsewhere in the Middle East, is the
                            danger of Soviet penetration. The Soviets have revived the traditional
                            Tsarist aspiration to influence in this region immediately to the south
                            of them; recent Soviet naval visits in the Gulf are the first Russian
                            visits in 60 years.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d91-08" facs="d91-08"/>
                        <p>But it remains to be seen what an increased "Soviet presence" in the Gulf
                            would consist of, and what the Soviets can plausibly expect to
                            accomplish:</p>
                        <p>—On the one hand, the region must present a tempting target: The British
                            departure seems to suggest a power vacuum; the significant Western
                            interests in the Gulf look particularly vulnerable to the tide of Arab
                            radicalism.</p>
                        <p>—On the other hand, greater Soviet involvement may magnify certain
                            contradictions in Soviet policy, e.g. , supporting Arab radicals even
                            while cultivating the Shah (an avowed conservative who has ties with
                            Israel). A cutoff of oil to the West would not be in the economic
                            interest of producing states, whatever their ideology. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to develop a need for Gulf
                            oil</p>
                        <p>(especially for supplying Eastern Europe), which will give it a stake in
                            the stability of the oil flow but will not be large enough to diminish
                            the importance of the West as a customer. The Soviets could not sustain
                            a significant naval force in the region (especially while the Canal is
                            closed), and the establishment of a naval base in the Gulf is
                            improbable.</p>
                        <p>—On yet another hand, short-sightedness or opportunism might draw the
                            Soviets into mischief-making in the Gulf no matter how clearly we can
                            see that it would only complicate Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The Problem</p>
                        <p>The central problem, therefore, is that it is easy to recognize the clear
                            potential for instability and increased Soviet and radical exploitation,
                            but it is difficult to determine how the U.S. can best help minimize the
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>While the Persian Gulf is very important to U.S. allies and friends, its
                            potential instability seems relatively unresponsive to U. S. power. The
                            main evolution will come in the form of political intrigue and
                            subversion in politically unprogressive and often inaccessible areas.
                            Because the main U.S. interest lies in the interests of allies and in
                            the area's relationship to the global strategic balance and because U.S.
                            power may not have significant impact on evolution within the area
                            itself, the problem is more one of devising the best possible
                            international framework for that evolution than it is figuring out ways
                            for the U. S. to involve itself directly. Within the limitation of that
                            framework, though, it is important to determine what kind of U. S.
                            presence can be most constructive.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Where Do We Want to Go?</p>
                        <p>Our strategy must aim at building the Gulf into a self-regulating
                            regional system as capable as possible by itself of filling whatever gap
                            is created by revision of the British protectorate:</p>
                        <p>—In such a system, stable relationships would exist at each level — an
                            equilibrium among the small sheikhdoms of the lower Gulf, collaboration
                            between the larger Gulf states (Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait), and mutual
                            deterrence between the outside powers in the background (U.S.,
                            U.K.,<lb/>and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>—At the same time, the larger states would help to keep order among the
                            smaller states, and also exert some counterweight against troublemakers
                            from inside or outside the system (e.g., Iraq, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>—Satisfactory political relations among all the Gulf states, enhanced by
                            mutual assistance for regional economic development, would improve the
                            chances of preserving stability within each.</p>
                        <p>—Soviet involvement would be discouraged first and foremost by the active
                            desire and capacity of the local states collectively to manage their
                            regional affairs. The need for active U.S. involvement would be
                            correspondingly reduced.</p>
                        <p>This is in fact the objective we have already been pursuing.</p>
                        <p>The Review Group went through the exercise of considering five distinct
                            strategy options: (a) assuming the U.K.'s role as protector ourselves,
                            (b) backing Iran as our "chosen instrument" and the key to stability;
                            (c) promoting Saudi-Iranian cooperation: (d) dealing directly with the
                            new states of the lower Gulf; and (e) actively promoting a regional
                            security pact.</p>
                        <p>The first and the last are impractical. The logical and obvious strategy
                            is to marry the middle three options: to promote Saudi-Iranian
                            cooperation as the mainstay of a stable regional system, but to
                            recognize Iran's special importance as the preponderant power in the
                            Gulf, and to do what we can to develop a working relationship with the
                            new political entities in the lower Gulf. There is no way to promote
                            cooperation without recognizing Iran's <pb n="10" xml:id="d91-10" facs="d91-10"/>preponderance (else we would lose our influence with
                            Iran); there is no reason to back Iran and not use our influence to
                            encourage Saudi-Iranian cooperation; there is no reason not to develop
                            ties with the sheikhdoms.</p>
                        <p>This strategy is upset, however, if we are ever forced to choose between
                            Iran and the Arabs. A crisis could result, for example, if the Shah
                            moves to seize the small Arab-held islands at the mouth of the Gulf (the
                            Tunbs and Abu Musa), that the Iranians claim as rightfully theirs and
                            crucial to their security. In the circumstances like those, we would
                            have to ask ourselves how much of our political capital to expend with
                            the Shah to restrain him. In the short run, the most serious strains on
                            Arab-Iranian collaboration will indeed come from Iran's behavior: Iran
                            is determined to step into Britain's shoes as the dominating and
                            protecting power in the Gulf. The Arabs do not relish this concept, and
                            there may be a necessity for the U.S. to restrain the Shah.</p>
                        <p>In the longer run, the Arab-Israeli conflict is another threat to
                            Arab-Iranian collaboration, and anything we can do to mitigate this
                            conflict will benefit us indirectly in the Gulf. The Iranians and Saudis
                            are perfectly conscious that Arab radicalism is a menace to them both;
                            this provides an incentive for collaboration (as when the Shah recently
                            extended military aid to the Saudis when their territory was raided by
                            South Yemen). But this collaboration also stigmatizes the</p>
                        <p>Saudis, since the Shah's ties with Israel make him a pariah to Arab
                            radicals. Saudi Arabia will clearly be the weak link in the chain. Its
                            future stability is already somewhat problematical. The longer and more
                            intense the Arab-Israeli conflict, the greater the radical pressure upon
                            all the conservative Arab regimes from both outside and inside.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Britain's Role</p>
                        <p>We have to bear in mind in formulating our basic strategy that the
                            British will still be actively involved in Gulf diplomacy. This is
                            another reason why it is wrong to assume that a vacuum is in
                            prospect.</p>
                        <p>Heath's victory in June has little to do with this. The Tories may indeed
                            stretch out the period of British military withdrawal slightly beyond
                            Wilson's deadline (the end of 1971). But it is too late to reverse the
                            process of local political change that the original U. K. withdrawal
                            announcement of 1968 has set in motion. (The Shah, the Saudis, and the
                            Kuwaitis have <pb n="11" xml:id="d91-11" facs="d91-11"/>all been
                            emphatic on this score.) Therefore, the Tories will likely proceed with
                            the withdrawal of most of their military forces from the Gulf proper,
                            and with the termination of formal defense treaties and protectorate
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>But Britain nevertheless has some leeway in deciding what its
                            "disengagement" will actually amount to. Wilson never planned to
                            withdraw Britain's political presence from the Gulf. Its active and
                            expert diplomacy, its commercial involvement, its military supply and
                            training in the Sheikhdoms, and possibly even its military contingency
                            planning will all continue, and will likely outweigh that of any other
                            outside power in the lower Gulf. The <gloss target="#t_RAF1">RAF</gloss>
                            complement at the staging base on Masirah Island (in the Arabian Sea off
                            Muscat/Oman) will also remain.</p>
                        <p>The new British Government has announced that it will decide the question
                            of its military deployment in accordance with two basic political
                            objectives: the "earliest possible settlement" through negotiation of
                            outstanding disputes in the Gulf, and the determination "on a practical

                            (in a single Federation, ideally). These should be our diplomatic
                            objectives as well. But we should continue to allow the British to take
                            the lead diplomatically.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. The Operational Plan</p>
                        <p>The British have discouraged us in the past from involving ourselves in
                            Gulf diplomacy. For this reason, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            has had no diplomatic presence in the lower Gulf, but has kept watch on
                            things from our Consulate General in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia (and also
                            through our <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> command on
                            Bahrain). When the British announced their disengagement decision (in
                            January 1968), they invited us to come in once their withdrawal was
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>One of the major purposes of our policy review exercise, therefore, was
                            to begin to determine the nature of our future presence in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>There are two serious issues: (a) our diplomatic and aid presence, and
                            (b) the future of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Diplomatic and Aid Presence</p>
                        <p>One of the serious limitations on our ability to act effectively in the
                            Gulf is that one of our important instrumentalities of influence —
                            capital <pb n="12" xml:id="d91-12" facs="d91-12"/>assistance — cannot be
                            effectively used. Many of the small sheikhdoms are capital-surplus
                            countries because of their oil wealth, and would not qualify for U.S.
                            capital aid. But all the Gulf states, large and small — and other
                            countries in the Arab world — badly need technical and educational
                            assistance, which the U.S. should be able to provide.</p>
                        <p>This kind of aid, plus private commercial involvement, will probably be
                            the extent of the U.S. presence in the Arab world for the foreseeable
                            future. It should not cost us much money — since much of it can come
                            from private U.S. sources, and the sheikhs will pay for it in any case.
                            It will be politically acceptable to the Arabs both because it will be
                            relatively low-key and because they want the help.</p>
                        <p>But the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not now have the
                            programs or appropriations geared to this kind of U.S. role. We need a
                            mechanism for marrying and channeling the various <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and private skills and resources —
                            technical assistance, investment promotion, cultural and educational
                            assistance and exchanges — where they are wanted. Your foreign Policy
                            Report of February 18, in the chapter on the Middle</p>
                        <p>East, alluded to this need. The Persian Gulf is the classic case, and we
                            should make it a proving for an imaginative new approach.</p>
                        <p>The Review Group has prepared a rough blueprint of a minimum U.S.
                            presence of this type, for possible use in planning the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 budget. It is a good start. It is
                            more complete, however, in spelling out the requirements of a
                            conventional diplomatic presence — diplomatic and consular services,
                            commercial attaches, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> scholarships,
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> [text not declassified]
                            activities — than it is in breaking new ground in a serious effort at an
                            imaginative new approach. What you can do now to move things in the
                            right direction is to (1) authorize the bureaucracy to continue and
                            complete the planning for our diplomatic mission, and to (2) instruct
                            the bureaucracy to integrate into our diplomatic presence a
                            comprehensive new program for technical and educational assistance and
                            cultural exchange. This new program should tie together such
                            requirements as: new criteria of eligibility for technical assistance; a
                            new organizational structure for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            (e.g., the role of the new technical assistance institute envisioned in
                            the Peterson <pb n="13" xml:id="d91-13" facs="d91-13"/>Report); new ways
                            of marrying U.S. private technical and managerial skills with local
                            needs; and new demands on State's educational and cultural affairs

                        </p>
                        <p>Our small naval force (two destroyers and a converted seaplane tender) is
                            presently home-ported on Bahrain by agreement with the British. The
                            Bahrainis would like us to stay. The British have offered us first
                            refusal on some of their own facilities once they leave. The question
                            is, do we want to stay?</p>
                        <p>A decision is needed now, so that arrangements can be worked out with the
                            Bahrainis and the British before the British go. More importantly
                            perhaps, we will have to sound out the Shah to see how strenuously he
                            will object to the continuation of an outside military presence: He will
                            be skeptical, but the problem may be less complicated now that he has
                            relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>The force is of little military value, and its presence could increase
                            the vulnerability of the already-unstable Bahraini regime. On the other
                            hand, a U.S. withdrawal at the same time as the British withdrawal could
                            have a harmful psychological effect: It would seem to signify that the
                            West is abandoning its interests.</p>
                        <p>On balance, I think that even though we cannot count on its being welcome
                            or useful for very long in the future, this is probably the wrong time
                            to remove <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. The
                            decision required is a decision in principle not to reduce our presence
                            at this time. This would trigger necessary feelers (with the Shah, the
                            Bahrainis, and the British) to determine the political feasibility. If
                            the political cost of staying on looks as if it will outweigh the
                            psychological utility of maintaining this form of "presence,” then we
                            should remove it.</p>

                        <p>The British — in connection with their military responsibilities — have
                            been the predominant arms suppliers to the area. Now, however, the
                            Kuwaitis have approached us on the sale of C-130 aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The argument for agreeing in principle would be to enhance the U.S.
                            political position.</p>
                        <p>The arguments against are that the U.S. wants to encourage maximum
                            continuing British political and military involvement in the Gulf and
                            that the U.S. has no interest in encouraging these nations to become

                                the seventh and eighth squadrons had to be clarified, since the Shah
                                had assumed from his October 1969 talks with the President that Iran
                                already had U.S. approval. A U.S. Government refusal to endorse the
                                sale at this stage, the Embassy observed, would run the "serious
                                risk of being interpreted by Shah as unilateral modification of
                                high-level policy decision" with serious consequences.

                                advised that the Shah had urgently demanded clarification of the

                                Government had not approved the seventh and eighth squadrons.

                        <p>Honorable <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName>
                            <lb/> Secretary of State<lb/> Department of State<lb/> Washington, D. C.
                            20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>We have just completed a searching examination of the major military
                            purchase program planned by the Shah of Iran over the next several
                            years. This has been a particularly difficult exercise, for it has
                            required us to balance an almost total lack of military requirements for
                            additional aircraft against the likelihood that our close relationship
                            with Iran would be damaged if we were to deny the Shah's request.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the intelligence community examined the threat to Iran this
                            summer and reported that the forces now possessed by the Shah are fully
                            competent to meet any threat with which Iran may be faced for the
                            foreseeable future. Juxtaposed against this limited threat, the Shah's
                            latest purchase proposal — for 71 F-4-Es, 4 RF-4Es and 30 C-130s — is
                            particularly disturbing to me, for the acquisition of so much new
                            equipment can only concern Iran's neighbors and, likely, force them to
                            react by acquiring new arms for their own forces.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's chief interest is his security. To agree to his full-purchase
                            program would, to my mind, be destabilizing in the Persian Gulf area,
                            lead his neighbors — principally Iraq — to increase their arms
                            inventories, strain Iran's financial and personnel resources, and
                            present new opportunities for the Soviets and radical Arab states to
                            penetrate the area.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that we must seek to dissuade the Shah from buying
                            all the aircraft he desires and, for this reason, am willing to agree to
                            sell Iran only two squadrons (UE-16) of F-4Es, plus up to 7 attrition
                            aircraft, together with 4 RF-4Es and 30 C-130s.</p>
                        <p>There is little question that the Shah will be unhappy over our
                            unwillingness to sell him all that he wants. Nevertheless, I consider
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d93-02" facs="d93-02"/>the course he appears to be
                            following inimical to Iran's interests and our own, and I think the time
                            has come to talk bluntly with him about arms stability in the Persian
                            Gulf area, as well as the excessive monetary and personnel costs which
                            these programs would entail.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that our staffs should now discuss the means for persuading the
                            Iranians of the logic of this arrangement, with a view to maintaining
                            both a stable arms balance in the area and the close and productive
                            US-Iranian relationship which in recent years has been so important for
                            promoting U.S. interests in Southwest Asia.</p>

                        <p>You will have seen the telegram from Tehran saying that the question of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> approval for the sale of seventh
                            and eighth squadrons of F-4 aircraft to Iran to now out in the open and
                            that the Shah has asked his Chief of Staff to find out what the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position is. Behind this query was the
                            fact that the representative of the
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> Aircraft Company, which makes
                            the F-4, had told the Iranians that the U.S. government was holding up a
                            contract and that unless the Iranians signed a contract right away the
                            price of the F-4 would go up. On that point, Defense Department has a
                            commitment now from MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> saying that
                            the price will remain the same at least through March of next year.</p>
                        <p>Defense circulated last night a draft telegram which was totally
                            unacceptable, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                            has written a letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. This will take a couple of days to iron out,
                            although I have made clear to Defense that its initial approach would
                            not be approved here.</p>
                        <p>The argument revolves around the following positions:</p>
                        <p>—The Defense Department believes that this additional equipment is not
                            warranted by the military threat to Iran; that the Iranian Air Force
                            will have technical difficulty integrating the additional equipment
                            within the next four years because it is already introducing over a
                            hundred of these aircraft in that period and having manpower problems in
                            handling them; and that the financial burden is at the moment beyond
                            Iran's or our capacity to manage. There are also attractive possible
                            alternatives to these aircraft which should be considered—the
                            probability that a follow-on aircraft to the F-5 will be available by
                            next spring and the possibility that there may be surplus <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F-4's available by 1974 or 1975.
                            Either of these alternatives would be cheaper for the Shah and simpler
                            to handle either because of the simpler aircraft or because of delay in
                            delivery.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d94-02" facs="d94-02"/>
                        <p>—The State Department argues that the way to approach the Shah is not to
                            tell him he cannot have the seventh and eighth squadrons but rather to
                            say that he can if he needs them but he does not have to decide right
                            now and there is some advantage in looking further at the alternatives
                            which we would be glad to discuss with him. State's a approach is not to
                            try to dissuade the Shah but to make sure that he has had a chance to
                            consider possible alteratives which might be advantageous to him.</p>
                        <p>I have talked with both State and Defense to press the line that nothing
                            should be done to call into question U.S. support for Iran's military
                            development but that—within that framework—there is no reason not to
                            have a discussion with the Shah about possible reasonable alternatives
                            that our production plans may offer provided that can be done in a way
                            that does not upset the political relationship.</p>
                        <p>A holding telegram has been sent to Tehran saying that the
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> report that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is planning to hold up the F-4's is not
                            true and that we will be prepared to discuss all the elements of the
                            decision shortly.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You asked me to discuss with you the issue of the seventh and eighth F-4E
                            squadrons for Iran. I now have a State-Defense telegram in draft for
                            your comment (attached).</p>
                        <p>I am fully aware of the importance of not doing anything to undercut the
                            President's relationship with the Shah or the Shah's confidence in the
                            U.S. as a supplier of the arms he needs. The Shah believes he has a
                            commitment to these two squadrons—which is a central fact—but I doubt
                            the President ever did more than promise general continued support.</p>
                        <p>The problem in this instance has been created by the
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> Corporation's efforts to rush
                            the government of Iran into signing a contract for the seventh and
                            eighth squadrons by December 1st. The Defense Department has been in
                            touch with MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> and has gained their
                            assurance that Iran's option on these aircraft need not be exercised
                            before March 1, 1971, and an assurance that there will be no change
                            during the intervening period in price, terms or delivery schedules from
                            those which Iran wants. So the pressure of time on this decision has
                            been removed.</p>
                        <p>The response to the Iranians in the attached telegram is essentially the
                            following: We recognize that it is Iran and not the U.S. that will
                            determine what it needs to buy for its security. However, since our
                            advice has been asked, we want to make available to the Iranians facts
                            which we are aware of that may figure in their final decision. One of
                            these is that a slight modification of the F-4E aircraft with less
                            electronics is now in prospect via a possible cooperative arrangement
                            with the West Germans. This would cost $1 million less than the aircraft
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> is now pressing on the
                            Iranians and yet would have essentially the operational capability that
                            Iran needs. This could amount to a saving of something like $34 million
                            for the Iranians. Another factor to be considered, given the <pb n="2" xml:id="d95-02" facs="d95-02"/>tightness of Iranian and U.S.
                            financial resources, is the relationship of these purchases to other
                            military purchase plans. Finally, the timing of deliveries relates to
                            the training of Iranian manpower to handle the additional aircraft, and
                            a study is now going on in the Iranian forces with the cooperation of
                            our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to determine these
                            relationships. This study will be finished next month.</p>
                        <p>The main thrust of the response, therefore, is that the Iranians do not
                            have to make up their minds until next March 1, and we suggest their
                            waiting until their study of total force and financial needs is
                            completed next month.</p>
                        <p>This draft telegram is a far cry from the initial Defense Department
                            position which set out to dissuade the Shah altogether from purchasing
                            the seventh and eighth squadrons. This in essence says that we do not
                            intend to oppose selling those squadrons once the Shah is satisfied on
                            exactly what version of the plane he wants and that the financial
                            resources and manpower will be available to manage them within the
                            delivery schedules proposed.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you authorize me to clear the attached telegram.</p>

                        <p>1. In response to query about <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            position on 7th and 8th squadrons F-4E's you should inform <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that we recognize fully it entirely
                            within <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> prerogative as well as its
                            responsibility to determine military forces it requires to provide for
                            its security. As a close friend whose advice is being sought on a wide
                            range of military questions, however, we feel that we would be derelict
                            were we not to make known insofar as possible factual considerations we
                            see which would help the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to make
                            sound and informed decisions. In the specific case of additional
                            squadrons of F-4's, we assume that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would wish to consider carefully and fully such
                            questions as <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> capablitiy to absorb
                            and use aircraft in terms of manpower, training, maintenance facilities,
                            possible less costly alternatives such as the F-4E (F), <pb n="2" xml:id="d96-02" facs="d96-02"/>and the financial impact additional
                            acquisitions may have on its other military purchase plans. We hope
                            these considerations will be illuminated by the <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> study which is still in progress and that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will not feel compelled to reach
                            decisions of this importance until this study has been concluded. We
                            also assume that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will wish to
                            consider with us the possible impact additional acquisitions could have
                            on the regional arms balance as we are certain they share our hope that
                            an arms race in the area can be avoided.</p>
                        <p>2. In connection with the time factor we appreciate <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s desire to minimize possibility that a
                            deferral of a decision to acquire additional F-4's may prove more
                            costly. We understand further that it must address itself by December 1,
                            1970 to a letter of intent it gave
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> in September indicating its
                            desire to acquire 73 F-4E's and 4 RF-4's. We have discussed this matter
                            with MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> and have been assured of
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> willingness to <pb n="3" xml:id="d96-03" facs="d96-03"/>convert the September letter of
                            intent into two arrangements: (a) a contract for 39 F-4E's and 4
                            RF-4E's, sale of which has been approved by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in response to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            request. (As Embassy aware, we understand financing not yet arranged for
                            7 of 39 F-4's, a fact which we assume <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will want to take account of before signing on dotted
                            line); and (b) a new option for 34 F-4E's which need not be exercised
                            before March 1, 1971 which stipulates there will be no rpt no change in
                            price, terms or delivery schedules from those embodied in current letter
                            of intent. FYI It noted that current letter of intent envisages delivery
                            of all 77 aircraft by December 1974,
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> has furnished us copy of
                            October 31 message from Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName> which indicates QUOTE final decision UNQUOTE
                            to have 25 aircraft delivered during calendar year 1973, 24 aircraft
                            delivered during 1974, and 24 aircraft delivered during 1975.
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> asserts this new <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> delivery schedule will cause costs to
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d96-04" facs="d96-04"/>rise above those cited in
                            letter of intent because all F-4E production is currently projected to
                            cease at end of calendar year 1974 except for production for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName>
                            now calculating cost estimates for latest <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> delivery schedule and we expect they will be
                            forthcoming shortly. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>3. As to question of transferring F-4E and/or RF-4E negotiations into
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> channels (Tehran 4772) wish to
                            point out that <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SECDEF</gloss> 9029 September
                            2, 1970 was not intended to convey impression that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> unalterably opposed to this
                            possibility. It was intended to convey our belief that we could not
                            appropriately comment on the details of direct negotiation between
                            private company and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, a process
                            to which we were not a party. We appreciate Embassy observation that in
                            spite of rapid advances <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may not yet
                            be prepared to fully understand or deal with complex issues involved in
                            negotiating a contract for highly sophisticated and expensive items such
                            as F-4's. We are therefore willing consider <pb n="5" xml:id="d96-05" facs="d96-05"/>your suggestion that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> handle transaction through <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> channel. We have not yet worked out with <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> how such changes might affect
                            December 1 time table. In so advising the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, however, it requested you indicate that any <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> negotiation would be on estimated cost
                            basis with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> having to pay any
                            increases or contrarily benefiting from any decreases arising out of
                            changes in MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> production schedules.
                            We understand <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has already rejected
                            such an arrangement with MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> and has

                        <p>In response to the memorandum of July 30, 1970, "Future U. S. Policy in
                            the Persian Gulf,” submitted by the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Interdepartmental Group for the Near
                            East and South Asia, the President has:</p>
                        <p>1. Approved a general strategy for the near term of promoting cooperation
                            between Iran and Saudi Arabia as the desirable basis for maintaining
                            stability in the Persian Gulf while recognizing the preponderance of
                            Iranian power and developing a direct U.S. relationship with the
                            separate political entities of the area.</p>
                        <p>2. Made a decision in principle not to reduce the U.S. naval presence in
                            the Persian Gulf at this time unless further exploration should prove it
                            politically unacceptable to friends of the U.S. in the area, in which
                            case a special report should be submitted to the President.</p>
                        <p>3. Approved in principle expansion of U.S. diplomatic representation in
                            the lower Gulf but directed the NSC Under Secretaries Committee to
                            assure that this representation is imaginatively adapted to the
                            requirements of this unique area and the pursuit of U.S. interests
                            there.</p>
                        <p>4. Directed the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries
                            Committee to review plans for U.S. technical and educational assistance
                            and cultural exchange in this area through private as well as public
                            programs to assure the development of imaginative programs consistent
                            with the strategy of promoting orderly development and local
                            responsibility for maintaining stability.</p>

                            (excluding Iran and Saudi Arabia) in the Persian Gulf. This memorandum

                        <p>1. With respect to future <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, President has made decision in principle not to
                            reduce U.S. Naval presence in Persian Gulf at this time unless further
                            exploration should prove it politically unacceptable to friends of U.S.
                            in area, in which case a special report should be submitted to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>2. Department aware Ruler of Bahrain wishes <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d98-02" facs="d98-02"/>to remain and anxious for U.S.
                            commitment to do so as soon as possible. Also aware British have for
                            some time been awaiting response as to what U.K. facilities <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> may wish to take over if
                            British Navy withdraws completely from Bahrain and <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> remains. Department now
                            proceeding with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and Department of
                            Navy to determine legal and logistic requirements for continued <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence in Bahrain after
                            independence, in events of either complete or partial withdrawal of
                            British Naval presence.</p>
                        <p>3. As President's decision indicates, however, continued presence <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> is considered sensitive
                            matter with friendly Gulf littoral states, particularly Iran. It
                            therefore imperative that confidential notification to them be carefully
                            orchestrated prior to our making any approach to either Bahrainis or to
                            British Naval Command in Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>4. Asst Sec'y <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> scheduled for
                            discussions with British next week on Middle East, including Persian
                            Gulf. Hopefully, this meeting may provide clearer picture British plans
                            re its own naval forces in Bahrain. We plan to use <pb n="3" xml:id="d98-03" facs="d98-03"/>that occastion to notify them,
                            confidentially, that we will be discussing continued presence <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> with Bahrainis after
                            notifying friendly littoral powers. If Shah's reaction, and that of
                            Kuwaiti and Saudi leaders constitute acquiescence, we would then proceed
                            quickly to initiate through Consul General Dhahran discussion with
                            Bahrainis re our desire maintain <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence. If, however, three littoral states
                            indicate strong negative reaction to <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>'s remaining, we shall be required to bring this
                            problem to attention of President with recommendations of how to
                            proceed.</p>
                        <p>5. Would appreciate Tehran, Jidda, and Kuwait views on timing and
                            substance of notification to host governments. Primary problem is, of
                            course, Iranian sensibilities, although we suspect that neither SAG nor
                            GOK will be enthusiastic about <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>'s remaining. Department's thinking is that we
                            should not seek approval of littoral states but merely inform them that
                            we plan to discuss with Bahrain <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>'s continued use of facilities on island. We
                            visualize <pb n="4" xml:id="d98-04" facs="d98-04"/>first notifying Iran
                            and, barring strenuous objection from Shah, shortly thereafter
                            similtaneously notifying Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF STATE<lb/> WASHINGTON<lb/> November 19, 1970</p>
                        <p>The Honorable<lb/> Melvin R. Laird,<lb/> Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mel:</p>
                        <p>I have your letter of October 27, 1970 in which you discuss Iran's desire
                            to acquire additional military aircraft over the next several years.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you recall the Shah of Iran's visit to Washington in October,
                            1969, during which he discussed with the President, you and me his
                            security requirements as he saw them. He was, of course, concerned about
                            the growing military strength of radical Arab States, particularly his
                            immediate neighbor Iraq. He commented specifically on the substantial
                            military aid these countries were receiving from the Soviet Union. It
                            was in the light of this situation and how he felt it might develop that
                            the Shah spoke of the need to develop and maintain a security force
                            sufficiently impressive to deter any potentially hostile neighbor or
                            group of neighbors from launching a first-strike against Iran's
                            vulnerable urban centers and vital oil installations. I am certain that
                            he continues to hold to this view and that it would be futile to try and
                            persuade him otherwise as long as current conditions and leadership in
                            his part of the world remain relatively unchanged.</p>
                        <p>I do believe, however, that our especially close relations with Iran
                            permit us to influence Iranian military decisions more than would
                            normally be the case. This relationship includes heavy Iranian reliance
                            on our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Tehran for advice on the
                            organization, training, management and operation of its military forces.
                            As you know, there is presently under way a study by the Iranian
                            military forces, aided by our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            mission, of Iran's military acquisition plans.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d99-02" facs="d99-02"/>
                        <p>We expect this study will illuminate fully the financial, manpower,
                            training, maintenance and operational implications of these plans,
                            including the possible acquisition of an additional two squadrons of
                            F-4E's. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            and Major General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> in
                            Tehran believe that this study should be finished by the end of this
                            year. They expect that upon its completion the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will be able to see much better than now how costly its
                            present plans are and to make judgments as to what areas of activity or
                            items might be cut back or stretched out if necessary.</p>
                        <p>To my mind, this process is the only way we can reasonably expect to
                            influence the size and scope of Iran's military acquisition plans. We
                            must be very careful, however, to avoid conveying the impression that we
                            are better judges than Iran of Iranian priorities and allocation of
                            resources. To do otherwise, am convinced, would reduce greatly the
                            considerable influence we now have and cause Iran to look elsewhere for
                            military aircraft. I fear also that it could lead to the Shah making a
                            direct linkage between the amount of assistance he expects of us in the
                            future and the very valuable and, in some instances, unique intelligence
                            and security facilities Iran now provides to us, a notion the Shah has
                            scrupulously avoided heretofore.</p>
                        <p>In sum, I believe that we are on the right track and that we should
                            continue to provide factual and technical information which should help
                            Iran reach informed decisions on its military acquisition plans.
                            Whatever decisions it may reach, we shall of course want to consider
                            carefully their impact on our overall relations and larger interests in
                            the area.</p>

                        <p>You will probably have seen Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s latest telegram (Tehran 5021 attached)
                            urging that he be authorized to give the Shah our agreement in principle
                            to the sale of the 7th and 8th squadrons of F-4s.</p>
                        <p>The logical response to him would be to give him a go-ahead to tell the
                            Shah that we, of course, have no objection to the sale and are willing
                            to agree in principle to it pending the necessary Iranian review of its
                            financial situation and the alternatives that could perhaps provide
                            these aircraft less expensively. This would be a step beyond the last
                            telegram which simply authorized <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> to say that Iran was, of course, the ultimate
                            judge of its needs but we felt that alternatives should be considered
                            before a final decision was made.</p>
                        <p>The bureaucratic problem is that State favors giving the Shah agreement
                            in principle now but Defense is resisting vigorously. I have talked with
                            State this morning urging them to get the disagreement down on paper so
                            that, if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> cannot
                            resolve it with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>,
                            we should put it up to the President. This is where we stand at the

                        <p>The Consortium has just completed a renegotiation of its contract with
                            the Shah of Iran. Under the renegotiated contract, the Iranian tax rate
                            increased 10% from 50% to 55%. The price of heavy oil was increased by 9
                            cents a barrel.</p>
                        <p>These increases will provide slightly more than the Shah's requirements
                            of a billion, one hundred million dollars for the year ending March,
                            1971. Assuming oil remains in short supply, with the continuation of the
                            Suez Canal closure, this will come close (about $50 million) to meeting
                            his requirements for the following 12 month period. There currently are
                            negotiations applying the 9 cents a barrel increase to light oil also,
                            which would help to meet any future shortfall.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these negotiations, the Shah is apparently satisfied at
                            the present time. However, the history of the relationship between the
                            Government of Iran and the Consortium is one of constant haggling for an
                            increased "take" by the government. No doubt we will be hearing again
                            from the government requesting that we urge the Consortium to provide
                            additional funds.</p>

                        <p>1. MY WIFE AND I DINED INFORMALLY WITH COURT MINISTER ALAM LAST EVENING
                            (NOV 30) BECAUSE HE WISHED TO DISCUSS WITH ME SOME MATTERS WHICH DEEPLY
                            CONCERNED SHAH. ONLY MINISTER OF ECONOMY ANSARY AND WIFE WERE PRESENT.
                            MY WIFE AND I LEFT ALAM'S HOME TO RETURN TO EMBASSY RESIDENCE ABOUT
                            11:00 P.M. MIDWAY BETWEEN ALAM'S RESIDENCE AND EMBASSY ON A BROAD
                            BOULEVARD A LARGE CAR CONTAINING THREE OR FOUR MEN (ESTIMATED AGE
                            MID-TWENTIES) OVERTOOK US AND SWERVED TOWARD US FORCING OUR CAR TOWARD
                            CURB. SINCE THIS WAS EVE OF HOLIDAY (CELEBRATING END OF RAMAZAN) WE AND
                            OUR DRIVER HAIKAZ INITIALLY ASSUMED CAR OCCUPANTS WERE SIMPLY EXUBERANT
                            CELEBRANTS OF FORTHCOMING HOLIDAY. HOWEVER, WHEN HAIKAZ REFUSED TO BE
                            FORCED FURTHER TOWARD CURB, CAR SWERVED IN, STRIKING LEFT SIDE OF OUR
                            CAR IN DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO FORCE US TO CURB AND CUT US OFF. ASSAILANTS
                            DID SUCCEED IN VIRTUALLY BRING US TO A HALT. AT SAME TIME SECOND CAR
                            TOOK POSITON BEHIND US. IN RAPIDLY MOVING MOVIE TYPE SCENARIO, TWO MEN
                            JUMPED OUT OF CAR, ONE WITH PISTOL POINTED AT US SHOUTING AND
                            GESTICULATING FOR US TO GET OUT. I INSTRUCTED OUR CHAUFFEUR, HAIKAZ, WHO
                            BEHAVED SUPERBLY, TO GO FULL SPEED AHEAD AND HE SKILL- FULLY DISENGAGED
                            FROM THE CAR WHICH HAD FORCED US TOWARDS CURB AND ACCELERATED,
                            MANEUVERING OUR CADILLAC BETWEEN ASSAILANTS CAR AND JUBE, WHEREUPON MAN
                            WITH PISTOL FIRED POINTBLANK AT US AS WE DROPPED TO FLOOR (BULLET LOGING
                            IN DOOR FRAME BY REAR SEAT). AT SAME TIME SECOND MAN HURLED AX AT REAR
                            SIDE WINDOW SHATTERING IT COMPLETELY WITH AX COMING TO REST WITH US-ON
                            FLOOR OF OUR CAR.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d102-02" facs="d102-02"/>
                        <p>2. I REPORTED INCIDENT TO COURT MINISTER ALAM IMMEDIATELY UPON RETURN TO
                            EMBASSY AND HE IN TURN AT ONCE REPORTED TO SHAH AND PRIMIN. ENTIRE
                            IRANIAN SECURITY APPARATUS WAS IMMEDIATELY ALERTED AND STARTED
                            INVESTIGATION. PRIME MINISTER CALLED ME PERSONALLY TO EXPRESS DEEP
                            REGRET AND PROPOSED THAT SPECIAL IRANIAN SECURITY GUARD BE PROVIDED FOR
                            BOTH MY WIFE AND ME. I HAVE ACCEPTED THIS OFFER AND WILL HANDLE IN WAY
                            WHICH WE HOPE WILL NOT BE TOO OBTRUSIVE.</p>
                        <p>3. ALTHOUGH NO ONE EXCEPT FEW OF MY CLOSEST ASSOCIATES KNOWS OF ATTACK,
                            IN VIEW OF CONDITION OF CAR AND FACT THAT IRANIAN GUARDS AT EMBASSY AND
                            HOUSEHOLD PERSONNEL AND MOTOR POOL PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT THERE WAS SOME
                            INCIDENT, KNEW THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED WILL IN DUE COURSE LEAK OUT.
                            EMBASSY PERSONNEL HAVE SIMPLY BEEN TOLD WE HAD AUTO ACCIDENT BUT NOBODY
                            HURT.</p>
                        <p>4. I AM PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS THAT THIS MATTER BE TREATED PUBLICLY IN WAY
                            WHICH WILL NOT RPT NOT EMBARRASS GOI. ACCORDINGLY, COURT MINISTER ALAM
                            (AFTER CONSULTATION WITH SHAH AND PRIMIN HOVEYDA) AND I HAVE AGREED THAT
                            WE WILL VOLUNTEER NO STATEMENT ABOUT INCIDENT BUT IF WE ARE QUERIED
                            RESPONSE WILL BE THAT WHILE RETURNING TO RESIDENCE FROM A DINNER LAST
                            EVENING OUR CAR WAS SIDESWIPED BY A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER WHO WAS
                            PROCEEDING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND THAT CAR SUFFERED BROKEN WINDOW
                            AND SOME OTHER DAMAGE BUT NOBODY HURT. WE CAN NOT SPECULATE ON WHETHER
                            ACCIDENT WAS DELIBERATE ON PART OF HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER OR SIMPLY RESULT
                            OF VERY BAD DRIVING FOR WHICH IRAN IS KNOWN.</p>
                        <p>5. I TRUST FOREGOING WILL BE HELD VERY CLOSELY IN DEPT ON NEED-TO-KNOW
                            BASIS AND THAT NOTHING WILL BE SAID OR VOLUNTEERED BY ANYONE. IF DEPT
                            SHOULD BE QUERIED, REQUEST IT REPLY AS AGREED WITH ALAM IN PARA 4 AND
                            THAT I BE NOTIFIED OF QUERY. THUS FAR NOBODY HAS A CLUE AS TO WHO WAS
                            BEHIND ATTACK OR WHAT MOTIVATED IT BUT SINCE OTHER OF MY PRINCIPAL
                            ASSOCIATES COULD POSSIBLY ALSO BE TARGETS WE ARE REVIEWING URGENTLY OUR
                            SECURITY PROCEDURES.</p>
                        <p>6. FINALLY I WILL IN DUE COURSE PROPOSE OUR DRIVER HAIKAZ FOR VERY
                            SPECIAL AWARD FOR WITHOUT HIS COURAGE, COOLNESS AND SKILL THERE WOULD
                            NOT HAVE BEEN A HAPPY ENDING.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On 15 October you addressed the question of Iran's desire to purchase 73
                            F-4E and 4 RF-4E aircraft (Tab A). Your decision was to approve the 4
                            RFs and only 39 F-4s at that time and to urge that State and Defense
                            undertake a vigorous effort both here and in Teheran to dissuade the
                            Shah from purchasing the balance on the grounds that they were
                            militarily unnecessary, would overtax Iran's limited technical
                            capability and could have a serious impact on the arms balance in the
                            Persian Gulf. You also accepted our recommendation that you be prepared
                            to reconsider this decision if we were unsuccessful in dissuading the
                            Shah. Although we have registered our reservations on Iran's acquiring
                            the last two squadrons of F-4s at various levels in the Shah's
                            entourage, his reactions have been anything but positive and the
                            increasing shrillness of his statements suggests that our efforts are
                            becoming counterproductive. In addition, negotiations between the
                            Government of Iran and MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> have
                            foundered over the disparity between the projected cost of a commercial
                            transaction and that of an RAS sale. The Shah has now decided to
                            purchase the F-4Es under <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The implications of this second development bear directly on our need to
                            move expeditiously on the 7th and 8th squadrons. Unlike the
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> "fixed price" offer (under
                            which these last two squadrons could be purchased as late as 1 March
                            1971 with no increase in price), there is a significant difference in
                            estimated cost if aircraft are ordered under <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> before 31 December 1970. Under <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>, aircraft ordered before that date will bear an
                            estimated flyaway unit price of $3.71 million while, after that date,
                            the price is estimated to rise to $3.84 million. (Iran has been given an
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> unit cost estimate of $3.77
                            million, the average of these two prices for 73 aircraft). Since the 7th
                            and 8th squadrons, plus two attrition F-4s, amount to 34 aircraft, our
                            forcing Iran to delay its purchase beyond 31 December would increase the
                            total cost to Iran by $4.42 million. The Shah would be understandably
                            disturbed when he became aware of this additional cost, as he
                            undoubtedly would, and there probably would be serious
                            repercussions.</p>

                        <p>We are still convinced that the points made in your 27 October letter to
                            Secretary Rogers (Tab B) remain valid, i.e., that there is no military
                            requirement for the 7th and 8th squadrons and that there are serious
                            drawbacks to Iran's acquiring such a large number of F-4s. State now
                            recognizes that the military justification for the sale is extremely
                            weak but has argued that it would be futile to attempt to dissuade the
                            Shah from buying the last two squadrons and that we should agree to sell
                            them on political grounds. We are now being pressed strongly on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Defense has succeeded in raising our points of reservation with the Shah
                            and in emphasizing within the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> that
                            the sale must be justified as a political, not a military, requirement.
                            It is my judgment, however, that in the final analysis State and the
                            White House will insist that the sale be approved. In light of this
                            probability, I see no merit in continuing to block the purchase of the
                            last two squadrons until our Iranian friends are forced to pay an
                            additional $4.42 million.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> withdraw
                            its objection to the sale of the last 34 F-4Es.</p>

                                had speculated that the radical Iranian student groups abroad, and
                                perhaps also the Palestinian Popular Front for the Liberation of
                                Palestine (PFLP), could have been involved in the attack. Since the
                                attack had betrayed the weaknesses in the Iranian system, the Prime
                                Minister also had requested U.S. assistance in putting Iranian
                                security files into processed data form. (Ibid., POL IRAN-US)</note>

                        <p>1. WHEN I SAW SHAH DEC 9 HE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AND RELIEF THAT NO HARM
                            HAD BEFALLEN US AS RESULT NOV 30 ABDUCTION ATTEMPT. HE WAS ALSO HAPPY TO
                            HEAR FROM HIS SECURITY PEOPLE THAT NEITHER OF US HAD BEEN UNNERVED BY
                            EXPERIENCE. HE SAID HE HAD INSTRUCTED IRANIAN SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO
                            FIND PERPETRATORS. HE WAS PERSONALLY CONVINCED THAT "THE SAME COMMUNIST
                            ELEMENTS" THAT WERE WORKING ON IRANIAN STUDENTS ABROAD, PARTICULARLY IN
                            WEST GERMANY, AUSTRIA, ITALY AND FOR THAT MATTER THE US, AS ATTACK ON
                            IRANIAN CONSULATE IN SAN FRANCISCO DEMONSTRATED, WERE BEHIND ATTEMPT. HE
                            REASONED THAT BY ABDUCTING AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AND THEN INSISTING IRAN
                            GOVT RELEASE "POLITICAL PRISONERS" COMMUNIST PERPETRATORS WOULD GAIN
                            WORLDWIDE ATTENTION AND COULD THEN TRY TO DISCREDIT SHAH'S WHITE
                            REVOLUTION AND PROGRAM OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS BY PORTRAYING GOI
                            AS FASCIST DICTATORSHIP WHICH WAS HOLDING LARGE NUMBERS OF "POLITICAL

                        <p>1. IN DEC 9 MEETING WITH SHAW I ASKED HIM ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS IN GULF
                            SINCE LAST I SAW HIM. HE SAID THERE NO PROGRESS ON TUNBS AND ABU MUSA
                            AND THAT CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATIONS AND TO HIS GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
                            KING FAISAL HAD BEEN OF NO HELP WHATSOEVER AND KUWAIT GOVT HAD BEEN
                            ACTUALLY HOSTILE BY ENCOURAGING SHEIKHS NOT TO REACH AGREEMENT. HE SAID
                            FAISAL TOOK POSITION, WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO ASSAIL, THAT BRITISH HAD
                            CREATED GULF PROBLEM BY SEIZING THESE ISLANDS DURING COLONIAL ERA AND
                            ARBITRARILY ALLOCATING THEM TO SHEIKHDOMS. SINCE THEY HAD CREATED
                            PROBLEM, IT WAS UP TO BRITISH TO SETTLE IT BEFORE THEY DEPARTED FROM
                            GULF NEXT YEAR. HE FRANKLY DID NOT KNOW WHY KUWAIT WAS SO HOSTILE TO AN
                            AGREEMENT BETWEEN SHEIKHS AND IRAN, PARTICULARLY SINCE KUWAIT WITHOUT A
                            STRONG <pb n="2" xml:id="d105-02" facs="d105-02"/>FRIEND SUCH AS IRAN
                            WAS VERY VULNERABLE INDEED TO IRAQ, WHOSE CLAIMS AND ASPIRATIONS RE
                            KUWAIT HAD NEVER BEEN RENOUNCED.</p>
                        <p>2. TURNING TO ISLANDS, HE SAID HE HAD MADE ABSOLUTELY AND UNEQUIVOCABLY
                            CLEAR TO BRITISH AND ARAB FRIENDS ON OTHER SIDE OF GULF THAT THESE
                            ISLANDS WERE IRANIAN AND AT VERY LEAST IRAN WOULD INSIST ON STATIONING
                            FORCES ON THEM. IF SHEIKHS WERE UNWILLING TO REACH SOME AGREEMENT FAULT
                            WOULD BE THEIRS BUT IRAN COULD COULD AND WOULD NOT LEAVE THESE ISLANDS
                            WHICH CONTROLLED MOUTH OF GULF SOLELY IN HANDS OF TINY SHEIKHDOMS WHICH
                            MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT SURVIVE RADICAL ARAB OFFENSIVE, WHICH HAS ALREADY
                            BEGUN THROUGH INSTALLATION OF SUBVERSIVE CADRES. IF SHEIKHS REMAIN
                            UNCOOPERATIVE, THEY COULD NOT LATER EXPECT COOPERATION FROM IRAN.</p>
                        <p>3. TURNING TO FEDERATION, HE SAID IRAN HAD RECENTLY REAFFIRMED AGAIN TO
                            SHEIKHDOMS THAT IF THEY WANTED FEDERATION (<gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>) IRAN FAVORED IDEA WHETHER <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> BE LARGE OR SMALL. HOWEVER, AT SAME TIME GOI HAD MADE
                            CLEAR THAT ISLANDS QUESTION MUST BE SETTLED FIRST AND THAT IF IT WERE
                            NOT, IRAN WOULD BE ACTIVELY OPPOSED TO A FEDERATION SHOULD SHEIKHDOMS
                            TRY TO ACTUALLY BRING ONE INTO BEING. SHAH THEN MENTIONED THAT IF THERE
                            IS ARAB-ISRAEL SETTLEMENT AND SUEZ CANAL IS OPENED, RUSSIANS WOULD BE
                            ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR NAVAL PRESENCE IN INDIAN OCEAN AND ARABIAN SEA
                            AREA WHICH WAS ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF CONCERN RE GULF. AS OBVIOUSLY
                            RUSSIANS WILL SUPPORT RADICAL ARAB REGIMES, PARTICULARLY IRAQ, AS
                            CATSPAWS TO PULL DOWN MODERATE ARAB REGIMES IN ARABIAN PENINSULA AND
                            THUS INCREASE SOVIET INFLUENCE IN AREA. THIS AFFORDED ME OPENING TO
                            RAISE FUTURE OF MIDEASFOR AS FOLLOWS.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. FUTURE OF MIDEASFOR</p>
                        <p>1. I REPLIED SOVIETS INCREASING THEIR NAVAL PRESENCE IN MEDITERRANEAN AND
                            AGREED FULLY WITH HIM THEY ALSO DOING SAME THING IN INDIAN OCEAN AND
                            GULF AREA. SAID I UNDERSTOOD HE HAD RECENTLY SEEN REPORTS OF CONCERN IN
                            UK AND US OVER STEADILY INCREASING SOVIET PRESENCE <pb n="3" xml:id="d105-03" facs="d105-03"/>IN INDIAN OCEAN AREA WHETHER US OR
                            IRAN LIKED IT OR NOT, THIS WAS FACT OF LIFE AND WE WOULD DOUBTLESS SEE
                            FURTHER EXPANSION 0F SOVIET NAVAL ACTIVITY IN INDIAN OCEAN, ARABIAN SEA
                            AND PERSIAN GULF. I WAS SURE HE WOULD AGREE IT WOULD WOULD GREAT TRAGEDY
                            IF RUSSIANS SUCCEEDED IN TURNING INDIAN OCEAN AND GULF AREA INTO WHAT
                            AMOUNTED TO SOVIET LAKE. FOR THESE REASONS USG WANTED HIM TO KNOW
                            CONFIDENTIALLY THAT WE PLANNED TO CONTINUE MIDEASTFOR AS AT PRESENT.
                            THIS WOULD HELP COUNTERBALANCE INCREASED SOVIET NAVAL PRESENCE BOTH IN
                            GULF AND IN INDIAN OCEAN AREA WHERE MIDEASTOR SPENT APPROXIMATELY TWO
                            THIRDS OF ITS TIME COVERING ITS AREA OF RESPONSIBLITY FROM CEYLON ACROSS
                            TO AFRICA.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH REPLIED HE HAD MADE CLEAR TO SOVIET AMBASSADOR THAT WHEN BRITISH
                            NAVY LEFT GULF HE DID NOT WANT IT REPLACED BY SOVIETS, AMERICANS OR
                            ANYONE ELSE. (HE ADDED HE TOLD BRITISH HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO BRITISH
                            NAVAL BASE OUTSIDE GULF IN OMAN.) I SAID I KNEW HE DID NOT WISH A
                            BRITISH OR AMERICAN PRETEXT FOR RUSSIANS TO COME INTO GULF BUT HARD FACT
                            OF LIFE IS THAT THEY ARE ALREADY IN GULF AND OBVIOUSLY INTENDED TO
                            CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SOME SORT OF PRESENCE THERE WHETHER ANYONE LIKED IT
                            OR NOT. I POINTED OUT THAT FOR SIXTY YEARS FROM DESTRUCTION OF IMPERIAL
                            RUSSIAN FLEET BY ADMIRAL TOGO IN 1905 TO ABOUT TWO AND HALF YEARS AGO
                            THERE HAD BEEN NO RUSSIAN NAVAL VESSELS IN GULF. HOWEVER, IN LAST TWO
                            AND HALF YEARS, THERE HAD BEEN FIVE VISITATIONS OF GROUPS OF SHIPS. SHAH
                            NODDED AND SAID "YES TWO OF THEM VISITED IRANIAN PORTS.” I WENT ON THAT
                            PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WAS FACT THAT RUSSIANS CONSTRUCTING NAVAL
                            FACILITY IN UMM-AL-QASR IN IRAQ NOMINALLY FOR IRAQ BUT OBVIOUSLY TO HAVE
                            AN AVAILABLE PORT UNDER CONTROL OF A COUNTRY HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON SOVIET
                            UNION FOR ASSISTANCE. OBVIOUSLY RUSSIAN SHIPS WOULD USE THIS PORT AS
                            THEY USE PORT THEY CONSTRUCTING IN EGYPT AS MAS-AL-MATRU WHICH, WHILE
                            NOMINALLY FOR UAR, IS ACTUALL FOR SOVIET NAVAL VESSELS. FOR A NUMBER OF
                            REASONS, INCLUDING THOSE I HAD CITED, WE HAD DECIDED FREE-WORLD
                            INTERESTS WOULD BEST BE SERVED BY CONTINUING MIDEASTFOR, WHICH WHILE

                                Tehran, December 2, the Embassy conveyed the Shah's concern over
                                information, allegedly from a Department source, that some State
                                officials viewed selling the two extra squadrons of F-4s to the
                                Iranians as “provocative.” <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> denied the rumors, but in a private
                                comment blamed the Shah's suspicions on the lack of a positive
                                response on the squadrons. (Ibid., POL 15-1 IRAN). In Telegram
                                197768 to Tehran, December 4, the Department responded that the
                                Shah's suspicions were disappointing after all the U.S. efforts to
                                ensure Iranian security, adding that the Department was trying to
                                come up with an inter-agency response on the F-4s. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. DURING HOUR AND HALF MEETING WITH SHAH DEC 9 HE SPENT MUCH TIME GOING
                            OVER REASONS BEHIND IRAN'S MILITARY ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS, STRESSING
                            THESE WERE BARE MINIMUM GIVEN POTENTIAL DANGERS IN A VERY PERILOUS
                            AREA.</p>
                        <p>2. HE OPENED BY STATING HE REMAINS CONVINCED THAT SOVIETS BASIC
                            OBJECTIVES REMAIN (A) EXPELLING US AND WESTERN INFLUENCE FROM ARABIAN
                            PENINSULA AND GULF AREA, AND (B) GAINING POSITION OF PRIMARY EXTERNAL
                            INFLUENCE IN THESE AREAS AND THAT SOVIET TACTICS IN ATTAINING THESE
                            OBJECTIVES IS TO USE RADICAL ARAB REGIMES TO DESTROY MODERATE ARAB
                            STATES.</p>
                        <p>3. KEEPING BASIC SOVIET OBJECTIVES IN MIND, SHAH WENT ON, FUTURE WILL
                            ALSO BE INFLUENCED MUCH BY (A) WHETHER THERE IS ARAB-ISRAEL SETTLEMENT:
                            (B) WHETHER PROPOSED ARAB FEDERATION OF UAR, SUDAN AND LIBYA BECOMES A
                            REALITY: AND (C) WHETHER IT IS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FIRST SYRIA AND
                            PERHAPS LATER IRAQ. SHAH DOES NOT BELIEVE SOVIETS WANT SETTLEMENT
                            BECAUSE THIS WOULD REDUCE DEPENDENCY OF RADICAL ARAB STATES ON SOVIET
                            UNION AND HENCE SOVIETS CAPABILITY TO PENETRATE WORLD AND GAIN EVER
                            INCREASING INFLUENCE IN THESE STATES.</p>
                        <p>4. RE ARAB FEDERATION, IF IT BECOMES REALITY IT SHOULD <pb n="2" xml:id="d106-02" facs="d106-02"/>NOT REPRESENT POTENTIAL DANGER FOR
                            MODERATE REGIMES IN ARABIAN PENINSULA IF IT IS CONFINED TO THREE
                            "AFRICAN MEMBERS" (UAR, LIBYA AND SUDAN). IF, HOWEVER, IT INCLUDES SYRIA
                            AND POSSIBLY LATER IRAQ, IT COULD REPRESENT GRAVE DANGER NOT ONLY FOR
                            MODERATE ARAB REGIMES IN SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND SHEIKHDOMS, BUT ALSO
                            IRAN FOR THAT MATTER. HE EXPLAINED THAT GIVEN RADICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL
                            NATURE OF REGIMES IN BOTH DAMASCUS AND BAGHDAD, EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
                            RECENT CHANGES THERE, THERE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE STRONG MATERIAL (OIL) AND
                            IDEOLOGICAL PRESSURES ON SUCH A FEDERATION FROM SYRIA (AND IRAQ IF IT
                            WERE A MEMBER) TO ACT TO REPLACE MODERATE, TRADITIONALIST REGIMES IN
                            JORDAN, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND GULF SHEIKHDOMS. IF SUCH A FEDERATION
                            EMBRACING SYRIA AND PERHAPS IRAQ SHOULD BECOME SOLID REALITY AND THERE
                            SHOULD BE ARAB-ISRAEL SETTLEMENT, SHAH IS VERY PESSIMISTIC AND DOES NOT
                            CONSIDER SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT OR EVEN JORDAN'S SURVIVAL POTENTIAL AS
                            GOOD.</p>
                        <p>5. THERE IS ALSO DANGER THAT SOUTHERN YEMEN (<gloss target="#t_PRSY1">PRSY</gloss>) AND YEMEN MAY MERGE AT SOME JUNCTURE THROUGH <gloss target="#t_PRSY1">PRSY</gloss> FORCE OR OTHERWISE. IF THIS HAPPENS
                            SAUDI ARABIA WILL BE EVEN MORE THREATENED. PRSY SITUATION IS
                            PARTICULARLY DISTURBING IN LIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SOVIETS
                            SUPPLYING <gloss target="#t_PRSY1">PRSY</gloss> WITH GROUND FORCE
                            EQUIPMENT FOR SIX BRIGADES AND ALSO LANDING CRAFT. "WHY”, HE ASKED, "HAS
                            SOUTHERN YEMEN ANY NEED FOR LANDING CRAFT UNLESS HAS DESIGNS ON OMAN AND
                            GULF SHEIKHDOMS? AND IF SOME OR ALL OF THESE SHOULD FALL AND RADICAL
                            REGIMES LIKE <gloss target="#t_PRSY1">PRSY</gloss> BE INSTALLED THERE,
                            WILL SOVIETS ALSO SUPPLY THEM WITH LANDING CRAFT FOR INFILTRATION
                            OPERATIONS IN AND ACROSS GULF TOWARD IRAN?”</p>
                        <p>6. ANOTHER POTENTIAL PROBLEM IRAN MUST CONSIDER IN JUDGING ITS SECURITY
                            REQUIREMENTS IS PAKISTAN WHERE RECENT ELECTIONS RESULTS CAME AS
                            CONSIDERABLE SHOCK TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. IT IS TOO
                            SOON, SHAH SAID, TO ESTIMATE WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THESE ELECTIONS. BUT
                            BHUTTO'S VICTORY IN WEST PAKISTAN IS VERY DISTURBING BECAUSE OF HIS
                            FANATICAL MILITANCY AGAINST INDIA AND HIS LEFTIST PHILOSOPHY WHICH MAY
                            LEAD HIM INTO MUCH CLOSER <pb n="3" xml:id="d106-03" facs="d106-03"/>RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH COMMUNIST CHINA AND SOVIETS. WHILE VICTORY IN
                            EAST PAKISTAN OF RAHMAN AND AWAMI LEAGUE, WHICH WANT MODUS VIVENDI WITH
                            INDIA, MAY TEND TO COUNTERACT BHUTTO'S HOSTILITY TOWARD INDIA, WHO CAN
                            TELL WHETHER EAST AND WEST PAKISTAN WILL REMAIN UNITED OVER NEXT FEW
                            YEARS? AND IF THEY GO SEPARATE WAYS, IRAN MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF
                            POSSIBILITY OF INSTALLATION OF EXTREME RADICAL REGIME IN WEST PAKISTAN
                            WITH VERY CLOSE TIES WITH SOVIETS AND CHICOMS. AT PRESENT IRAN HAS ONLY
                            ONE DIVISION COVERING ITS WHOLE EASTERN BORDER AND HAS NO NAVAL STRENGTH
                            OUTSIDE GULF EVEN THOUGH IRAN HAS COASTLINE ON GULF OF OMAN OF OVER 500
                            KILOMETERS. THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT MORE ESSENTIALL THAN EVER FOR
                            IRAN TO PURCHASE THE TWO ADDITIONAL DESTROYERS FROM US IT HAS REQUESTED.
                            SHAH MENTIONED THAT IRAN'S ORIGINAL STRATEGIC NAVAL CONCEPT WAS CONFINED
                            TO GULF. HOWEVER, IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO INCLUDE A CAPABILITY IN GULF OF
                            OMAN TO COVER IMPORTANT SEA APPROACHES TO "IRAN'S LIFELINE, THE GULF,”
                            AND ALSO BECAUSE OF POSSIBILITY ARAB SIDE OF GULF OF OMAN MIGHT FALL
                            INTO HANDS OF RADICAL REGIME THAT MIGHT WISH TO INFILTRATE SUBVERSIVE
                            TEAMS THROUGH IRAN'S LONG AND TOTALLY EXPOSED COAST ON GULF OF OMAN. TO
                            ADD TO PROBLEM, IT POSSIBLE THAT A RADICAL <pb n="4" xml:id="d106-04" facs="d106-04"/>GOVT COULD EVENTUALLY EMERGE IN WEST PAKISTAN, WHICH
                            IF NOT ACTUALLY HOSTILE TO IRAN, MIGHT BE AT LEAST UNHELPFUL AND
                            UNCOOPERATIVE.</p>
                        <p>7. INSOFAR AS AIR FORCE (<gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss>) CONCERNED
                            IRAN MUST WAVE SOME CAPABILITY OF DEFENDING ITS VAST WEST AND SOUTHERN
                            AIR FRONTIER STRETCHING FROM TURKEY TO PAKISTAN FRONTIER, A DISTANCE OF
                            THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS AS WELL AS SOME CAPABILITY ON ON NORTHERN
                            FRONTIER WITH SOVIET UNION TO GIVE CREDIBILITY TO IRAN'S WARNING THAT IF
                            SOVIETS EVER INVADE IRAN THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOOT THEIR WAY IN. IRAN
                            REALIZES IT CANNOT COVER ALL OF THIS VAST AREA AS FORCE NEEDED WOULD BE
                            TOTALLY BEYOND IRAN'S FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES. THEREFORE IT MUST
                            TAKE CALCULATED RISKS AND ASSUME THAT IT WILL NOT HAVE TROUBLE ON ALL
                            ITS FRONTIERS AT SAME TIME. THIS WAS WHY <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> REQUIREMENTS HE HAS GIVEN US FOR EIGHT SQDNS OF F-4S
                            ARE IN REALITY AUSTERE IN LIGHT OF VAST AREA TO BE COVERED AND ARE
                            ABSOLUTE AND INDISPENSABLE MINIMUM. HE OBSERVED IRAN'S SITUATION IS
                            QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OURS IN THAT WE HAVE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEAN
                            CUSHIONS AND ALSO HAVE HIGHLY TRAINED AIR RESERVE UNITS WITH COMBAT-
                            EXPERIENCED PILOTS WHICH, IN EVENT OF NEED CAN BE ACTIVATED IN SHORT
                            TIME, THUS EXPANDING OUR AIR CAPABILITY. IRAN HAS NO SUCH CUSHIONS AND
                            NO SUCH RESERVE. IT HAD TO COUNT ON ACTIVE UNITS ALONE WITH NO BACK-UP
                            WHATSOEVER. THIS IS WHY IIAF REQUIREMENTS HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH
                            PRESIDENT IN OCTOBER 1969 WERE <pb n="5" xml:id="d106-05" facs="d106-05"/>ABSOLUTE MINIMUM.</p>
                        <p>8. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING HE IS NOT TRYING TO CREATE "SOME KIND OF GREAT
                            IMPERIAL ARMED FORCE LIKE KAISER WILHELM OR LIKE HITLER.” ON CONTRARY,
                            WHAT HE WANTS IS RELATIVELY SMALL BUT HIGHLY EFFICIENT AND WELL-TRAINED
                            FORCE WHICH AT SAME TIME WOULD BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COUNTER ANYTHING
                            BUT MAJOR SOVIET ATTACK. GIVEN VAST AREA INVOLVED, NATURE OF BASIC
                            SOVIET OBJECTIVES AND TACITCS, AND OTHER POTENTIAL THREATS, SIX
                            DIVISIONS PLUS SEVERAL BRIGADES WAS ABSOLUTE MINIMUM GROUND FORCE
                            ALTHOUGH HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT ON HAND FOR
                            RESERVE DIVISIONS. SIMILARLY, THE NAVAL AND AIR REQUIREMENTS HE HAD
                            INDICATED TO US WERE ESSENTIAL MINIMUM. WHILE IN PRINCIPLE HE WOULD LIKE
                            TO ACQUIRE ALL HIS EQUIPMENT FROM US, HE KNEW THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE BUT
                            HE DID WISH TO EQUIP HIS AIR FORCE ENTIRELY FROM US AND OTHER SELECTED
                            ITEMS FROM CREDIT THAT REMAINED. HE MENTIONED TOUFANIAN-TWITCHELL STUDY
                            (TTS) WHICH HE SAID WOULD SOON BE READY AND WOULD INDICATE IRAN'S
                            REQUIREMENTS WHEN TTS COMPLETED, HE WOULD WISH TO DISCUSS REQUIREMENTS
                            WITH US WITH VIEW TO EXTENDING 1968 UNDERSTANDING AS FORMER UNDER
                            SECRETARY RICHARDSON HAD INDICATED WE WERE WILLING TO CONSIDER.</p>
                        <p>9. I SAID AS I UNDERSTOOD IT, TTS WOULD PROVIDE HIM WITH BASIC
                            INFORMATION RELATING TO EQUIPMENT THE THREE SERVICES DESIRED AND ALSO
                            THE RELATED PROBLEMS OF COST, TRAINED MANPOWER, INFRASTRUCTURE, ETC.
                            THIS, I OBSERVED, SHOULD BE GOOD BASIS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF FIVE, YEAR
                            PLAN HE HAD MENTIONED TO <persName corresp="#p_REL1">RICHARDSON</persName>. SHAH COUNTERED SAYING TTS WOULD IN EFFECT
                            CONSTITUTE IRAN'S FIVE-YEAR REQUIREMENTS. I COMMENTED THAT OBVIOUSLY
                            WHAT EMERGED FROM STUDY HAD TO BE RELATED TO IRAN'S FINANCIAL, HUMAN AND
                            OTHER RESOURCES AS WELL AS TO SOME SCHEDULE OF EQUIPMENT PAYMENTS OVER A
                            FIVE YEAR PERIOD. THIS SEEMED ESSENTIAL AS IRAN WOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO
                            TIME-PHASE ITS ACQUISITIONS IN KEEPING WITH ITS RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL
                            AND MANPOWER CAPABILITIES. SHAH CONCEDED THAT THIS WAS OF COURSE TRUE
                            BUT SAID HE WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT INSOFAR AS AIRCRAFT ARE <pb n="6" xml:id="d106-06" facs="d106-06"/>CONCERNED, DECISION AS TO WHAT IS
                            NEEDED HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.</p>
                        <p>10. HE THEN ASKED ME POINT BLANK WHETHER IT IT WE HAD OBJECTIONS TO 7TH
                            AND 8TH SQDNS OF F-4 AIRCRAFT. REPLIED BY SAYING WE TRYING TO HELP IN
                            ALL POSSIBLE WAYS, LISTING, AS I HAD TO ALAM, WHAT WE HAD DONE TO TRY TO
                            HELP IRAN MEET ITS MILITARY NEEDS: E.G., SHIFTING FROM FMS TD; EX-IM,
                            PICKING UP MISSING EIGHTH TRANCHE. OUR WILLINGNESS TO EXPAND PILOT
                            TRAINING, ETC. OBVIOUSLY, THERE WERE PROBLEMS FOR GOI INCLUDING
                            FINANCING. HOWEVER,I COULD ASSURE HIM HIS DESIRE TO ACQUIRE THESE
                            AIRCRAFT WAS FULLY UNDERSTOOD IN WASHINGTON WHICH I ALSO KNEW WAS
                            EXAMINING PROBLEM. I FELT SURE HE KNEW WE WOULD DO OUR LEVEL BEST TO
                            HELP IRAN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO MEET ITS SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. HE SAID
                            HE WAS SURE HE COULD COUNT ON US.</p>
                        <p>11. COMMENT: AT BEGINNING OF OUR DISCUSSION OF F-4S AND IRAN'S MILITARY
                            REQUIREMENTS, SHAH WAS IN SOMBER AND RATHER SUSPICIOUS MOOD, OBVIOUSLY
                            IN PART CAUSED BY REPORTS (TEHRAN 5193) THAT ELEMENTS WITHIN USG
                            OPPOSING HIS ACQUISITION OF 7TH AND 8TH F-104 SQDNS AS WELL AS
                            OPPOSITION TO FLAME THROWERS. RE LATTER, HE SAID RATHER ACIDLY HE COULD
                            OBTAIN ALL HE WANTED FROM ISRAEL. HOWEVER, BY END OF OUR CONVERSATION HE
                            SEEMED IN MORE RELAXED MOOD, PARTICULARLY AS RESULT OF ASSURANCES IN
                            VERY HELPFUL STATE 199179 AND <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SECDEF</gloss>
                            7580 THAT I WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO QUESTION
                            WHATSOEVER THAT SHAH HAS MADE FINAL DECISION ON ACQUISITION OF 7TH AND
                            8TH F-4 SQDNS AND, EXPECTS OUR APPROVAL AND COOPERATION. I NEED NOT ADD
                            THAT IF WE FAIL HIM ON THIS, IT WILL CHANGE HIS ENTIRE OUTLOOK.</p>

                            decision has been made to approve in principle <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> request to purchase additional 34 F-4E aircraft

                        <p>2. While doing so request you again specify reasons why <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has studied his request so carefully in
                            order dispel any misunderstandings Shah may have gained through informal

                            attitudes toward Iran and its security requirements. You are well aware
                            of the major reservations that have been held throughout consideration
                            of Shah's request. We believe it desirable you continue to stress with

                            Iran's manpower requirements and financing of the transaction. Proposed

                            requirements, it could be forced to place some aircraft in storage.
                            Further, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> ability provide large-scale
                            F-4 technical assistance over a long term cannot be assured. In addition
                            we had hoped Shah would have benefit of <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> study to assist him in making necessary
                            difficult decisions on allocating Iran's resources.</p>

                        <p>4. You should ensure that Shah recognizes that, despite our reservations,
                            if he wishes to buy the remaining 34 F-4s, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will agree. We are only concerned he know that as
                            long-time friend and ally, US desires he be aware of very important
                            factors we believe he would want to consider in making decision of this

                            QUESTION OF JAN 12 MEETING TO DEALWITH OIL PRICE INCREASES. IN FIRST
                            PLACE, SHAH YESTERDAY MADE MAJOR SPEECH AT CABINET-PLANORG MEETING (FOR
                            FIRST TIME SUCH MEETING COVERED BY BOTH TELEVISION AND PRESS) IN WHICH
                            HE STRESSED (A) IN VIEW MAJOR DECLINE IN PURCHASING POWER OF STERLING
                            AND DOLLARS OVER PAST FEW YEARS IRAN AND OTHER OIL PRODUCERS IN RELATIVE
                            TERMS RECEIVING SUBSTANTIALLY LESS FOR THEIR OIL THAN TEN TO TWELVE

                        <p>2. FURTHERMORE LAST EVENING COURT CALLED ME TO SAY SHAH WAS "DEEPLY
                            DISTURBED" BY EFFORTS OF CONSORTIUM TO POSTPONE JAN 12 MEETING. WHILE
                            SHAH DID NOT WISH ANOTHER UNPLEASANT CONRONTATION WITH CONSORTIUM IF IT
                            INSISTED ON POSTPONEMENT OF JAN 12 MEETING IRAN WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
                            TO UNILATERALLY DECIDE ON POSTED PRICE INCREASES. SHAH THEREFORE HOPED
                            USG WOULD URGE US COMPANIES IN CONSORTIUM TO MEET JAN I2 DEADLINE.</p>
                        <p>3. I SAID THAT WHILE I WOULD TRANSMIT SHAH'S REQUEST, I PERSONALLY FELT
                            IRAN AND OPEC MEMBERS HAD GIVEN CONSORTIUM VERY LITTLE TIME TO GET READY
                            FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEETING. IN FIRST PLACE, ALTHOUGH VENEZUELA OPEC
                            MEETING HAD TERMINATED DEC I2, REPORT HAD NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC UNTIL DEC
                            28. SO NEITHER OIL CONSORTIUM COMPANIES NOR THEIR GOVTS HAD, INSOFAR AS
                            I KNEW, ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF VENEZUELA DECISIONS UNTIL NOW.

                            PERIOD WHEN MANY IMPORTANT EXECUTIVES, WHOSE VIEWS AND JUDGMENT WERE
                            NEEDED, WOULD PROBABLY BE TAKING WELL EARNED VACATION OF ANYWHERE FROM
                            TWO TO THREE WEEKS. FINALLY, I COULD TELL HIM THAT USG DID FEEL THAT
                            TIME FRAME FOR JAN 12 MEETING WAS VERY SHORT AND DIFFICULT TO MEET IN
                            VIEW OF WHAT I HAD SAID TO HIM ABOVE (REF B). ALAM SAID NONETHELESS SHAH
                            TRUSTED THAT USG WOULD, URGE COMPANIES TO MEET DEADLINE.</p>
                        <p>4. VAN REEVEN (CONSORTIUM GENERAL MANAGER) INFORMS US THAT FINMIN
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName>, WHO REPRESENTED
                            IRAN AT VENEZUELA OPEC MEETING, STOPPED OVER IN LONDON DEC 22 AND GAVE
                            ADDISTON (CONSORTIUM) COPY OF OPEC VENEZUELA REPORT. VAN REEVEN ALSO
                            SAID <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> HAS PRESSED HIM
                            HARD TO URGE CONSORTIUM MEMBERS TO MEET JAN 12 DEADLINE FOR MEETING.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> SAID DEADLINE NOT
                            MET OPEC COMMITTEE HE HEADS (IRAQ-SAUDIS-IRAQ) MUST REPORT TO SECGEN
                            OPEC AND AS PRACTICAL MATTER THIS WOULD RESULT <pb n="3" xml:id="d108-03" facs="d108-03"/>IN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF OPEC,
                            RESULTS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT PREDICT. VAN REEVEN FEARS UNLESS
                            CONSORTIUM SENDS SOMEONE TO AT LEAST BEGIN TALKS JAN 12, THERE MAY BE
                            STRONG AND VERY ADVERSE EMOTIONAL REACTION ON PART OF GOI WHICH COULD
                            LEAD TO UNFORTUNATE DECISIONS. ACCORDINGLY, HE HAD URGED CONSORTIUM TO
                            SEND SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE TO AT LEAST BEGIN DISCUSSIONS JAN 12 EVEN IF
                            THEY TURN OUT TO BE PROLONGED (WITH NEED FOR SUSPENSION AT SOME POINT
                            FOR CONSULTATIONS).</p>
                        <p>5. POSSIBILITY OF BEGINNING TALKS JAN 12 BUT STRINGING (THEM OUT OVER
                            PERIOD OF SOME WEEKS WOULD NOT SEEM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ONE FACTOR—THIS
                            IS SHAH'S PLANS TO PROCEED TO SWITZERLAND ABOUT JAN 20 FOR HIS ANNUAL
                            FOUR WEEK MEDICAL CHECK-UP AND VACTION. WE SUSPECT THAT THESE PLANS MAY
                            BE IN PART RESPONSIBLE FOR ADAMANT GOI POSITON THAT TALKS MUST BEGIN JAN
                            12 WITH AGREEMENTS REACHED RELATIVELY SOON THEREAFTER.</p>
                        <p>6. COMMENT: UNTIL WE KNOW CONSORTIUM REACTION TO VAN REEVEN'S STRONG
                            RECOMMENDATION THAT CONSORTIUM SEND TEAM HEADED BY SENIOR MEMBER TO AT
                            LEAST BEGIN TALKS JAN 12, WE ARE NOT IN POSITION TO MAKE ANY
                            RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO TRY HEAD OFF POSSIBILITY OF

                            ARABIA AND IRAQ. HOWEVER, I DO OWE ALAM REPLY TO SHAH'S REQUEST THAT

                        <p>1. DURING MEETING <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss> ANNENBERG AND I HAD
                            WITH SHAH JAN 14 A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF IRAN AND MID-EAST SITUATION WAS
                            INTERRUPTED BY TELEPHONE CALL FROM <gloss target="#t_PMPRIMIN1">PRIMIN</gloss> HOVEYDA TO SHAH RE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>-CONSORTIUM PROBLEM. THIS AFFORDED NATURAL OPENING TO
                            DISCUSS <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>-CONSORTIUM NEGOTIATION AND
                            MAKE POINTS IN <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. IN RESPONSE TO MY ASSERTION THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            HAS FIRST-HAND <pb n="2" xml:id="d109-02" facs="d109-02"/>KNOWLEDGE THAT
                            OIL COMPANIES HAVE GENUINE LEGAL AND COMMERCIAL PROBLEMS BUT WE BELEIVE
                            THEY PREPARED TO BE FLEXIBLE AND FORTHCOMING, SHAH REPLIED WITH BITING
                            SKEPTICISM, SAYING IT INCONCEIVABLE THAT CONSORTIUM, WHICH WAS ALERTED
                            IN LONDON ON DEC 22 TO DETAILS OF <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            RESOLUTIONS, COULD NOT HAVE HAD A NEGOTIATING TEAM IN TEHRAN BY JAN 12.
                            HE FELT ACTION OF CONSORTIUM SENDING TEAM WHICH NOT ONLY COULD NOT
                            NEGOTIATE BUT WOULD NOT EVEN NAME DATE WHEN RESPONSIBLE CONSORTIUM
                            NEGOTIATIORS WOULD ARRIVE IN TEHRAN WAS ANOTHER TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF
                            CONSORTIUM'S "ARROGANCE.” WHILE CONSORTIUM HAD GOT AWAY WITH ARROGANT
                            APPROACH IN PAST HE WISHED TO ASSERT UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THEY WOULD NEVER
                            AGAIN GET AWAY WITH IT INNPUGRE. HE SEEMED PARTICULARLY INCENSED THAT
                            CONSORTIUM GROUP IN JAN 12 MEETING HAD BEEN UNWILLING TO GIVE ANY
                            INDICATION WHEN PRINCIPALS WOULD BE PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AT NEGOTIATING
                            TABLE. I AGAIN EMPHASIZED THAT CONSORTIUM, BECUASE OF ITS INTERNATIONAL
                            COMPOSITION, HAD GENUINE LEGAL AND COMMERCIAL PROBLEMS THAT HAD TO BE
                            SORTED OUT. ON PERSONAL BASIS I ALSO POINTED OUT THAT CONSORTIUM HAD
                            BEEN INFORMED JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS-NEW YEARS HOLIDAY WHEN TRADITIONALLY
                            SOME IMPORTANT EXECUTIVES, KEY MEMBERS OF THEIR STAFFS, WERE NOT ALWAYS
                            IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.</p>
                        <p>3. SHAH BRUSHED ASIDE THESE ARGUMENTS SAYING HE OFTEN WORKED ON HOLIDAY
                            WHEN NECESSARY AND CONSORTIUM COULD DO LIKEWISE. HE WANTED TO MAKE
                            CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> WOULD MEET IN
                            TEHRAN NEXT TUESDAY, JAN 19, AND IF CONSORTIUM PRINCIPALS HAD NOT
                            ARRIVED IN TERHAN AND BEGUN NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE THAT DATE, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> WOULD TAKE ITS OWN UNILATERAL ACTION,
                            WHICH WOULD INCLUDE SHUTTING DOWN PRODUCTION. I AGAIN REFERRED TO
                            DIFFICULT LEGAL AND OTHER PROBLEMS COMPANIES HAD TO SOLVE AND EXPLAINED
                            (PARA 4 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WOULD TAKE SERIOUS VIEW OF ANY
                            ARBITRARY DEADLINES OR PRODUCTION CUTBACKS OR SHUTDOWNS WHICH WOULD
                            INEVITABLY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES INVOLVED. SHAH RESPONDED
                            WITH RESTRAIND ANGER, SAYING HE SUPPOSED THIS WAS "A BIG POWER THREAT.”
                            HE WANTED US TO KNOW THAT THREATS WOULD NOT WORK AND THAT IRAN AND ITS
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d109-03" facs="d109-03"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> PARTNERS, REGARDLESS OF
                            CONSEQUENCES TO RELATIONS WITH WESTERN OIL CONSUMING COUNTRIES, WOULD
                            PROCEED UNILATERALLY WITH PRODUCTION SHUTDOWNS UNLESS CONSORTIUM WERE
                            FORTHCOMING.</p>
                        <p>4. I REPLIED THAT WITH ALL DUE: RESPECT THERE HAD BEEN NO THREAT OF ANY
                            IMPLIED IN WHAT I HAD SAID. POINTS I HAD MADE WERE (A) WE DID FEEL
                            DEADLINE SET BY VENEZUELA <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            RESOLUTION HAD BEEN SHORT GIVEN VERY COMPLEX LEGAL AND OTHER PROBLEMS
                            INVOLVED FOR CONSORTIUM: (B) WE CONVINCED THAT AS SOON AS THESE PROBLEMS
                            SORTED OUT THE CONSTORTIUM WOULD BE PREPARED TO COME FORWARD AND
                            NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH, PUTTING FORWARD PROPOSALS THAT WOULD BE
                            RESPONSIVE TO <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> GROUP'S OBJECTIVES
                            AND (C) IF MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE AND ANY ARBITRARY
                            PRODUCTION CUTBACK WERE INSTITUTED BY <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, THEN INEVITABLY BECAUSE OF EFFECT OF SUCH A CUTBACK
                            ON ECONOMIES OF MANY COUNTREIS, IT WOULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT RELATIONS WITH
                            THE PRODUCER INVOLVED.</p>
                        <p>5. SHAH SAID IRAN HAD BEEN PATIENT FOR YEARS AND BELIEVED IN MODERATION.
                            IT HAD NO INTENTION OF FOLLOWING COURSE OF LIBYA OR VENEZUELA, EVEN
                            THOUGH COMPANIES CRAVENLY FOLDED UP TO LIBYAN PRSSURE "WHILE
                            INTRANSIGENT TO IRAN AN ALLY THAT EXERCISED MODERATION.” IF CONSORTIUM
                            GROUP ARRIVED IN TIME TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE JAN 19 AND IF IT WAS
                            CLEAR THAT CONSORTIUM WAS SINCERE AND WAS NOT JUST SITTING DOWN TO
                            NEGOTIATING TABLE TO DRAG ITS FEET FURTHER, THEN, OF COURSE, THERE WOULD
                            BE NO NEED TO CUT BACK OR SUSPEND PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, IT WAS UP TO
                            CONSORTIUM TO PROVE ITS GOODWILL AND SINCERITY. WHILE HE SPOKE FOR IRAN
                            HE FELT SURE SAUDI AND IRAQ MEMBERS OF PRICING COMMITTEE WOULD AGREE. HE
                            ALSO SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN SUCH NEGOTIATIONS CONSORTIUM NEGOTIATORS
                            MIGHT HAVE TO REFER BACK SOME PROBLEMS TO THEIR HOME OFFICES AND ASK FOR
                            A DELAY OF 24, 36 OR A FEW MORE HOURS MORE. THIS DID NOT POSE PROBLEM
                            INSOFAR AS HE IS CONCERNED. HOWEVER, IF OPEC IS NOT TO BE <pb n="4" xml:id="d109-04" facs="d109-04"/>FORCED TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION,
                            COMPANIES MUST IN GOOD FAITH BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE JAN 19. I SAID
                            THERE WERE MANY RUMORS GOING AROUND THAT PRODUCTION CUTBACKS OR

                        <p>6. SHAH CONCLUDED BY LONG AND EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL CRITICISM OF CONSORTIUM
                            ATTITUDE AND ACTIONS OVER NUMBER OF YFARS, CASTIGATING IT FOR ARROGANCE
                            AND <pb n="5" xml:id="d109-05" facs="d109-05"/>ATTEMPT TO PUSH PRODUCING
                            COUNTRIES AROUND. HE SAID THIS WOULD NEVER WORK AGAIN NOR WOULD
                            PRODUCING COUNTRIES EVER AGAIN ACCEPT THAT KIND OF TREATMENT.
                            FURTHERMORE, CONSORTIUM COMPANIES AND CONSUMING GOVTS HAD BEEN DERIVING

                            INCREASED TAXES WITH NO CORRESPONDING BENEFITS FOR PRODUCTERS. NET

                            (PARTICULARLY PARA 4) THE STRENGTH AND VEHEMENCE OF HIS REACTION
                            SURPASSED OUR ESTIMATE. NONETHELESS I THINK IT WAS USEFUL AND NECESSARY
                            TO MAKE PITCH WE DID SO THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MISUNDERSTANDING ON HIS
                            PART THAT ARBITRARY CUTBACK OR SHUTDOWN OF PRODUCTION WOULD INEVITABLY
                            LEAD TO VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IN RELATIONS WITH US AND OTHER
                            CONSUMERS. WHILE HE WAS AT THE TIME EXTREMELY IRKED, I DO NOT BELIEVE
                            DESPITE VEHEMENCE OF HIS REACTION THAT IT WILL LAST. FURTHERMORE EVEN IF
                            IT DOES ENDURE FOR A TIME THE GRAVITY OF THIS ENTIRE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF
                            NOT JUST OIL COMPANIES BUT CONSUMER GOVTS HAD TO BE MADE CLEAR. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> ZAHEDI, WHO SAW HIM JUST AFTER I

                            HAD SAID HE INITIALLY MISUNDERSTOOD POINTS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE.
                            FURTHERMORE, AFTER OIL PART OF OUR DISCUSSION CONCLUDED, SHAH DISCUSSED
                            A NUMBER OF OTHER TOPICS FOR OVER AN HOUR IN MOST AMICABLE AND FRIENDLY
                            WAY.</p>

                            FEEL REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT SHAH WILL RESTRAIN ANY EFFORTS TO USE
                            PRODUCTION CUTBACKS AS BLACKMAILING WEAPON IN NEGOTIATIONS, ALTHOUGH,
                            OBVIOUSLY, SUCH ACTION WILL HANG LIKE SWORD OF DAMOCLES OVER HEADS OF
                            NEGOTIATORS UNTIL AGREEMENT IS REACHED. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT
                            CONSORTIUM AT ONCE INFORM FINMIN <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> OF DATE WHEN ITS NEGOTIATING PRINCIPALS WILL
                            ARRIVE TO ENABLE NEGOTIATIONS TO BE UNDER WAY PRIOR TO JAN 19. ANY OTHER
                            COURSE IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR TROUBLE.</p>

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<lb/> WASHINGTON<lb/> January 16, 1971</p>
                        <p>Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                        <p>I have become increasingly concerned about growing indications of an
                            imminent impasse in relations between the oil producing countries and
                            the oil companies. It is apparent that such an impasse could benefit no
                            one.</p>
                        <p>Oil supply is vital to the free world. Therefore, your interests in oil
                            and ours are bound intimately together. The consuming countries need a
                            secure source of oil available on reasonable terms, and the producing
                            countries have every right to expect a fair income from their most
                            precious resource. The United States Government has taken such legal
                            steps as it can to facilitate expeditious negotiations between the
                            companies and the oil producing countries.</p>
                        <p>In this spirit I have asked <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">John
                                Irwin</persName>, Under Secretary of State, to act as my emissary to
                            deliver this letter to you and to contribute constructively to the
                            efforts of both sides to arrive at an equitable solution to this
                            pressing problem.</p>
                        <p>I hope you will feel free to discuss these matters frankly with him in
                            the same close cooperative spirit that has always characterized our
                            relations.</p>

                            THE CONSUMING COUNTRIES. PREVIOUSLY THE US HAD NOT PARTICIPATED IN ANY
                            OIL NEGOTIATIONS AND IT WAS DOING SO NOW TO THIS VERY LIMITED EXTENT,
                            BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THESE NEGOTIATIONS WERE CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE
                            OIL INDUSTRY, ARRANGEMENTS IN THE PERSIAN LILF, EFFECT ON EUROPE, JAPAN,
                            ELSEWHERE AND THE US, AND BECAUSE THREATS HAD ISSUED FROM LIBYA THAT OIL
                            WOULD BE USED AS A POLITICAL WEAPON AGAINST US POLICY IN THE MIDDLE
                            EAST. THE US WAS NOT REPRESENTING OR TAKING THE <pb n="2" xml:id="d111-02" facs="d111-02"/>PART PER SE OF THE OIL COMPANIES
                            BUT BECAUSE OF THE GREATER INTEREST, INCLUDING THAT OF IRAN, WE WERE
                            ASKING HIM TO USE HIS GREAT PRESTIGE AND INFLUENCE TO SEEK AN AGREEMENT
                            WHICH WOULD RESULT IN STABILITY.</p>
                        <p>3. I OUTLINED BRIEFLY ASPECTS OF THE STRATEGIC SITUATION IN EUROPE AND
                            THE MIDDLE EAST AND HIM TOOK OVER GIVING AN INTERESTING ANALYSIS OF THE
                            WORLD SCENE FROM HIS VIEWPOINT. (<gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> WILL REPORT ON THIS
                            SEPARATELY AS HE HAS HAD A SIMILAR CONVERSATION WITH HIM.)</p>
                        <p>4. I COMMENTED ON THE EFFECT OF CUTS BY LIBYA IN ITS PRODUCTION ON EUROPE
                            AND JAPAN AND THEREFORE ON THE US, ON THE EFFECT OF TAPLINE AND ON THE
                            EVEN GREATER PROBLEMS OF ALL OF US IF PRODUCTION WERE HALTED OR EVEN CUT
                            IN THE PERSIAN GULF;</p>
                        <p>(A) THAT PART OF OUR CONCERN AND THAT OF THE OIL COMPANIES AROSE FROM THE
                            RECENT NEGOTIATION WHICH RESULTED IN PRICE INCREASES FIRST IN LIBYA,
                            NEXT IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND THEN IN VENEZUELA, ONLY TO HAVE THE CYCLE
                            BEGIN AGAIN IN LIBYA AND NOW IN <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            WITH ITS CARACAS RESOLUTION. THE FEAR WAS THE PATTERN WOULD BE REPEATED.
                            THIS WOULD CREATE AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION FOR THE OIL COMPANIES AND
                            ALSO FOR EUROPE, JAPAN, AND THE US. THE QUESTION WAS WOULD IT BE JUST
                            ANOTHER ROUND OF PRICE INCREASES OR COULD IT BE A RESPONSIBLE
                            NEGOTIATION WHICH WOULD BRING STABILITY FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME TO
                            THE OIL INDUSTRY;</p>
                        <p>(B) THAT THE US HAD URGED THE OIL COMPANIES APPROACH THE NEGOTIATION IN A
                            COOPERATIVE SPIRIT AND TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH FOR AN AGREEMENT FAIR
                            TO ALL;</p>
                        <p>(C) THAT THE US HAD GIVEN THE OIL COMPANIES CERTAIN LIMITED ASSURANCES
                            REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF ANTI-TRUST LAWS, BUT HAD DONE SO ONLY ON
                            JANUARY 15, 1971. THIS MEANT THAT THE OIL COMPANIES HAD HAD NO TIME TO
                            EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND PREPARE THE JOINT POSITION NEEDED TO ENTER THE
                            NEGOTIATIONS. I HOPED HIM WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS FACT AND WOULD RECOGNIZE
                            THAT ALTHOUGH THE OIL COMPANIES HAD SENT TWO NEGOTIATORS TO BEGIN
                            DISCUSSIONS IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THE COMPANIES TO PREPARE ALL THE DATA
                            NEEDED TO CONCLUDE THE NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>5. IN DISCUSSION WE ALSO COVERED ASPECT RE FUTURE OIL SUPPLY, WORLD AND
                            INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY NEEDS, THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE IN FUTURE OF PERSIAN
                            GULF OIL, THE ADVANTAGES THAT THE OIL COMPANIES BROUGHT TO THE PRODUCING
                            COUNTRIES, E.G., CAPITAL NEEDED IN THE NEXT DECADE, PERHAPS $200
                            BILLION, ACCESS TO MARKETS AND MARKETING FACILITIES, THAT WOULD BE MOST
                            DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF ARRANGEMENTS WERE ATTEMPTED
                            DIRECTLY BETWEEN PRODUCING AND CONSUMING COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d111-03" facs="d111-03"/>
                        <p>6. THE SHAH SAID HE GREATLY APPRECIATED EXPLANATIONS I HAD GIVEN HIM AND
                            WAS GRATEFUL TO THE PRESIDENT FOR SENDING ME. HE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT
                            COMPANIES DID NOT WISH TO BE WHIP-SAWED BY ESCALATION AD SERIATIM
                            DEMANDS BY DIFFERENT PRODUCERS OR COUNTRIES. HE FELT OFFER BY OIL
                            COMPANIES REPRESENTED A GOOD BASE FOR NEGOTIATION BECAUSE IT ACCEPTED
                            THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INCREASE IN PRICES AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPLE OF AN
                            INDEX WHICH WOULD PROTECT THE PRODUCERS AGAINST INFLATION IN THE
                            WEST.</p>
                        <p>7. HE SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT THE COMPANIES HAD INCLUDED IN THEIR
                            PAPER A REFUSAL TO ACCEPT (A) NO FURTHER INCREASE IN TAX RATE PERCENTAGE
                            BEYOND CURRENT 55 PERCENT RATE; (B) NO RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS; AND (C) NO
                            NEW OBLIGATORY REINVESTMENT BECAUSE THESE THREE POINTS HAD NOT BEEN
                            INCLUDED IN THE VENEZUELAN-OPEC RESOLUTION. HE KNEW VENEZUELA, ALGERIA,
                            AND LIBYA HAD OTHER IDEAS BUT THESE HAD BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE
                            RESOLUTION. HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE SAW NO CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS
                            OF THE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> RESOLUTION AND THE
                            COMPANIES RESPONSE.</p>
                        <p>8. HE ALSO AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO STABILIZE PRICES FOR
                            FIVE YEARS. HOWEVER, THIS MEANT A FREEZE ON PRICES BY BOTH PRODUCERS AND
                            COMPANIES. HE HAD STATISTICS WHICH SHOWED <pb n="4" xml:id="d111-04" facs="d111-04"/>COMPANY PRICE INCREASES ALREADY PUT INTO EFFECT MORE
                            THAN COVERED INCREASES IRAN HAD IN MIND. THEREFORE IF COMPANIES TRIED TO
                            INCREASE PRICES AS RESULT OF AGREEMENT REACHED IN FORTHCOMING
                            NEGOTIATIONS, PRODUCERS WOULD HAVE TO BENEFIT ACCORDINGLY. HE ALSO MADE
                            CLEAR THAT WHEN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED IT WOULD BE RETRACTIVE TO JANUARY
                            1, 1971 AS GP AND SHELL HAD JUST RAISED THEIR PRICES AT END OF DECEMBER.
                            TO SUMMARIZE, HE BELIEVED THAT NEGOTIATIONS COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY
                            CONCLUDED IF, BUT ONLY IF, "THERE IS NO DISCRIMINATION, NO FAVORITISM,
                            AND NO DIRTY TRICKS ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY NEGOTIATORS.”</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d111-05" facs="d111-05"/>
                        <p>9. AMPLIFYING REMARK ABOUT "NO DIRTY TRICKS,” SHAH SAID THAT IF, HOWEVER,
                            COMPANIES DRAGGED OUT THE NEGOTIATIONS OR IF THEY REACHED AN AGREEMENT
                            WITH THE GULF PRODUCERS HEADED BY IRAN BUT REFUSED TO SIGN SUCH AN
                            AGREEMENT UNLESS ALL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> MEMBERS
                            SUBSCRIBED TO IT, THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS TROUBLE. AS THE OIL COMPANIES
                            KNEW FULL WELL, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR IRAN AND THE GULF PRODUCERS TO
                            IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON VENEZUELA OR RADICAL ARAB PRODUCERS SUCH AS LIBYA,
                            ALGERIA, AND POSSIBLY IRAQ WHICH ASKED MUCH MORE. THEREFORE ANY ATTEMPT
                            BY THE COMPANIES TO SAY THAT THEY WOULD NOT SIGN AN AGREEMENT UNLESS
                            THESE STATES, WHICH WERE ALREADY RECEIVING OR MAKING DEMANDS FOR MORE
                            THAN WAS IN THE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> RESOLUTION, ALSO
                            SIGNED SIMILAR AGREEMENT, WOULD BE TAKEN BY IRAN AND THE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> AS A SIGN OF BAD FAITH AND HE COULD
                            ASSURE US THAT <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> WOULD TAKE ACTION.
                            IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANIES TO GET AWAY WITH THE TACTICS OF
                            TRYING TO PLAY OPEC MEMBERS OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER AND STRINGING OUT
                            NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>10. THE SHAH SAID WHEN SAUDI OIL MINISTER VISITED TEHRAN YESTERDAY HE
                            BROUGHT A MESSAGE FROM KING FAISAL THAT SAUDI ARABIA WOULD GO ALONG WITH
                            WHATEVER THE SHAH AGREED TO. THERE WAS A SIMILAR INDICATION FROM KUWAIT.
                            WHILE IRAQ MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO TRY TO MAKE TROUBLE, HE THOUGHT IRAQ
                            COULD BE CONTAINED BY IRAN, THE SAUDIS, AND OTHER MODERATE GULF
                            PRODUCERS. THE SHAH REITERATED GULF PRODUCERS WILLING TO SIGN A
                            FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT ON BASIS OF <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            RESOLUTION EVEN IF VENEZUELA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN PRODUCERS (IRAQ,
                            LIBYA, AND ALGERIA) WERE UNWILLING TO DO SO. OBVIOUSLY, HOWEVER, IF
                            COMPANIES AGREED TO GIVE THESE COUNTRIES SUBSTANTIALLY MORE IN TAXES AND
                            ROYALTIES THAN GULF STATES, THERE WOULD BE POLITICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
                            PROBLEMS. THE SHAH INDICATED HE HOPED COMPANIES WOULD STAND FIRM AGAINST
                            THOSE MAKING UNREASONABLE DEMANDS. HE PERSONALLY FELT THAT THE COMPANIES
                            SHOULD DEAL SEPARATELY WITH THE THREE MAJOR OIL PRODUCING
                            AREAS—VENEZUELA (CARIBBEAN), MEDITERRANEAN, AND THE GULF WITHIN
                            FRAMEWORK OF <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. HE REPEATED,
                            HOWEVER, THAT IRAN AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF COUNTRIES WOULD AGREE TO ABIDE
                            BY FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT EVEN IF OIL COMPANIES CAVED INTO HIGHER DEMANDS
                            OF LIBYA, ALGERIA, AND VENEZUELA. IT WAS CLEAR THOUGH THAT SUCH ACTION
                            BY OIL COMPANIES WOULD ANGER HIM AND MAKE RELATIONS DIFFICULT.</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: SHAH RECEIVED ME THROUGHOUT THE TWO-HOUR MEETING IN A FRIENDLY
                            MANNER, LISTENING ATTENTIVELY AND EXPRESSING APPRECIATION OF OUR
                            VIEWPOINTS AND PROBLEMS. AMBASSADOR AND I BOTH BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A
                            MUCH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS AND THOSE
                            OF NATO AND FREE WORLD COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE NATURE OF AN OIL
                            SETTLEMENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss>
                            ZAHEDI (WHO SAW SHAH IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE DID) TOLD US THAT SHAH HAD
                            FOUND OUR MEETING "TO BE VERY USEFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE.” I THINK THE
                            TALKS WERE SUCCESSFUL FROM OUR VIEWPOINT AND THAT IT WILL INFLUENCE HIM
                            TOWARD MODERATION, IF, BUT ONLY IF, COMPANIES ARE UNDERSTANDING AND
                            RESPONSIVE TO THE FACTS OF LIFE THEY WILL FACE AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS
                            WE ARE SUBMITTING.</p>
                        <p>THE CRUX, HOWEVER, OF THE WHOLE VISIT WAS THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT FOR
                            WHOM HIM EXPRESSED HIGHEST REGARD AND ADMIRATION HAD SENT AN
                            EMISSARY.</p>
                        <p>SUBSEQUENTLY, WE HAD A MEETING WITH FINANCE MIN <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> WHO GAVE US DETAILED
                            CLARIFICATION OF SHAH'S VIEWS WHICH CAST QUITE A NEW AND HELPFUL LIGHT
                            ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM. I AM SUMMARIZING <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName>'S CLARIFICATIONS IMMEDIATELY
                            FOLLOWING TELEGRAM TOGETHER WITH MY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH

                            AGREES AND ON WHICH I HOTE ACTION CAN QUICKLLY BE TAKEN. WE HAVE
                            CLASSIFIED TELEGRAMS <gloss target="#t_NoForn1">NOFORN</gloss> SO THAT
                            DECISION ON BRIEFING ALL OIL COMPANIES, AMERICAN AND FOREIGN, CAN BE

                        <p>1. I MET AT NOON JAN 19 WITH CONSORTIUM NEGOTIATORS (LORD STRATHELMOND
                            AND PIERCEY) VAN REEVEN (CONSORTIUM TEHRAN) AND <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, FRENCH AND DUTCH AMBASSADORS TO BRIEF THEM
                            CONFIDENTIALLY ON WHAT WE HAD PICKED UP RE IRANIAN VIEWS IN TALKS UNDER
                            SECRETARY HAD JAN 18 WITH SHAH AND FINANCE MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName>. I DREW SUBSTANTIALLY ON
                                <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss> (B) FOR DETAILS OF IRANIAN
                            VIEWS, EXPRESSING CONVICTION THAT COMPREHENSION ON PART OF SHAH AND HIS
                            MINISTERS RE COMPLEXITY OF PROBLEMS INVOLVED AND REASONS FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CONCERN HAD BEEN GREATLY INCREASED AS
                            RESULT OF UNDER SECRETARY'S VISIT, WHICH I THOUGHT RESULTED NOT ONLY IN
                            BETTER UNDERSTANDING HERE BUT ALSO IMPROVED <pb n="2" xml:id="d112-02" facs="d112-02"/>GENERAL ATMOSPHERE. ALSO TOLD THEM OF UNDER
                            SECRETARY'S PRESENTATION OF DIFFICULTIES OUR ANTITRUST LAWS PRESENTED
                            FOR US COMPANIES DUE TO FACT THEY COULD NOT CONSULT TO DEVELOP A COMMON
                            POSITION UNTIL <gloss target="#t_Dept1">DEPT</gloss>. OF JUSTICE HAD
                            GIVEN CLEARANCE FRIDAY. HENCE NEED FOR SOME PATIENCE AND AVOIDANCE ANY
                            ARBITRARY DEADLINES.</p>
                        <p>2. FOLLOWING ARE SALIENT POINTS THAT WERE: DISCUSSED BY CONSORTIUM
                            MEMBERS DURING BRIEFING:</p>
                        <p>(A) I TOLD THEM OF IRAN INSISTANCE THAT EFFECTIVE DATE OF ANY AGREEMENT
                            BE EARLY IN JAN. 1971 AND MY OWN RECOMMENDATION THAT COMPANIES MAKE THIS
                            CONCESSION EARLY IN DISCUSSIONS AS IT MIGHT LESSEN PRESSURE IF
                            NEGOTIATIONS HAD TO LAST LONGER THAN <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> GROUP ANTICIPATED. STRATHELMOND MADE NO COMMENT BUT
                            PIERCEY'S FIRST REACTION WAS TO REJECT IDEA OF ANY SUCH DATE AS
                            "IMPOSSIBLE.” I GAVE HIM MY PERSONAL VIEW THAT IF CONSORTIUM WAS GOING
                            TO GET AN AGREEMENT SHAH WOULD INSIST ON JAN EFFECTIVE DATE FOR SUCH
                            AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <p>(B) IN REPLY TO MY STRESSING THAT OPENING MEETING WITH <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> SUBCOMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON COULD BE
                            OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF NEGOTIATIONS, BOTH
                            STRATHELMOND AND PIERCEY AGREED THEY WOULD HAVE IRANIAN ATMOSPHERICS IN
                            MIND AND WOULD DO UTMOST TO HANDLE DISCUSSIONS IN WAY TO AVOID ADVERSE
                            REACTIONS OR RAISING DOUBTS IN <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S MINDS AS TO SINCERITY AND
                            SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE OF COMPANIES.</p>
                        <p>(C) IN CONNECTIONS WITH (B) ABOVE, I MENTIONED THAT IF CONSORTIUM
                            NEGOTIATORS AGAIN SAID (AS DID CONSORTIUM JUNIOR <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S ON JAN 12) THAT THEY WERE NOT IN POSITION TO
                            "NEGOTIATE,” FAT WOULD BE IN FIRE. STRATHELMOND SAID THAT WHILE THEY
                            WERE NOT EMPOWERED BY COMPANIES <pb n="3" xml:id="d112-03" facs="d112-03"/>TO SAY THEY THEY WERE IN TEHRAN TO NEGOTIATE, ( THEY
                            COULD SAY "DISCUSS”), HE FELT THEY COULD HANDLE THIS DEFTLY IN MANNER,
                            WHICH WOULD NOT GET <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'S HACKLES UP.
                            PIERCEY ALSO CONVINCED WHILE THEIR INSTRUCTIONS WOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO
                            BE CATEGORIC ON THIS SCORE THEY COULD MAKE CLEAR THEY WERE FULLY
                            EMPOWERED TO DISCUSS DETAILS AND THEY EMPHASIZED THEY WOULD NOT PERMIT
                            DIFFICULTIES ON THIS SCORE TO RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF TALKS. THEY ALSO
                            SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THEY COULD NOT PULL OUT AS EARLIER LOWER LEVEL
                            GROUP HAD DONE AFTER JAN 12 MEETING AND SEEMED RESIGNED TO STAYING ON
                            TILL CONCLUSION OF TALKS UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUZKLY AGREED WITH <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> GROUP.</p>
                        <p>(D) I ADVISED THEM THAT SECSTATE AND CALLED MCCLOY AND GIVEN HIM SUMMARY
                            OF OUR DISCUSSION WITH IRANIANS AND HAD SUGGESTED COMPANY <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S BE DESIGNATED AS "NEGOTIATORS.”
                            SECSTATE HAD ALSO EXPRESSED VIEW COMPANIES WOULD BE WELL- ADVISED TO
                            NEGOTIATE WITH GULF PRODUCERS WITH PARALLEL NEGOTIATIONS WITH LIBYANS.
                            NEGOTIATORS COMMENTED THAT 15 COMPANIES WERE COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATE
                            COMPREHENSIVE DEAL WITH <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> COUNTRIES.
                            THEY WERE PRESENTLY FACED WITH IRANIAN PROPOSITION WHICH, WHILE
                            SUPERFICIALLY ATTRACTIVE, WOULD RESULT IN AGREEMENT WITH GULF PRODUCERS
                            RATHER THAN ALL OF <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. THIS WOULD BE
                            REVERSAL OF THEIR FORMAL POSITION IN INDUSTRY STATEMENT THAT COMPANIES
                            WERE COMMITTED TO COMPREHENSIVE DEAL WITH ALL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> MEMBERS. I POINTED OUT AGAIN AS I HAD IN INITIAL
                            BRIEFING THAT I BELIEVED GULF MEMBERS INCLUDING IRAN WOULD READILY AGREE
                            TO SINGLE AGREEMENT COVERING ALL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            MEMBERS BUT PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WOULD BE HIGHEST COMMON DENOMINATOR AND
                            MOST EXTREME DEMANDS OF RADICAL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            MEMBERS WOULD PROBABLY PREVAIL. WHILE PIERCEY SEEMED QUITE FIXED ON IDEA
                            THAT COMPANIES SHOULD SIGN NO <pb n="4" xml:id="d112-04" facs="d112-04"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NO AGREEMENT WITH IRAN UNTIL THERE
                            HAD ALSO BEEN AN AGREEMENT WITH LIBYA. WHICH MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN
                            GULF AGREEMENT, STRATHELMOND SHOWED A BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND
                            RECOGNIZED THAT COMPANIES SHOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER WHETHER A FIRM AND
                            DEPENDABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE GULF PRODUCERS (BEFORE AGREEMENT CONCLUDED
                            WITH LIBYA) MIGHT CUT GROUND OUT FROM UNDER ALGERIAN AND LIBYAN
                            BLACKMAIL AND IF COMPANIES DID NOT AGREE TO THEIR <pb n="5" xml:id="d112-05" facs="d112-05"/>EXCESSIVE TERMS <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> AS A WHOLE SUPPORT THEM. STRATHELMOND
                            SEVERAL TIMES REFERRED TO COMPANIES OBJECTIVE OF HAVING MEDITERRANEAN
                            NEGOTIATING GROUP NAMED BY <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> WHICH
                            WOULD PERMIT PARALLEL NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE PLACE WITH GULF AND
                            MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES. HE INDICATED THAT HE HOPED TO GET ACCEPTANCE OF
                            THIS CONCEPT IN MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.</p>
                        <p>(E) RE <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName>'S STATEMENT TO US
                            THAT IF COMPANY <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S MADE CLEAR AT
                            OUTSET THAT THEY WERE HERE TO NEGOTIATE AND NEGOTIATIONS ACTUALLY BEGUN,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> WILLING RECOMMEND
                            POSTPONEMENT OF JAN 23 FULL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            MEETING, THERE SEEMED SOME DIFFERENCE OF VIEW BETWEEN STRATHELMOND AND
                            PIERCEY ON DESIRABILITY OF POSTPONEMENT OF JAN 23 FULL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> MEETING. PIERCY'S. VIEW WAS JAN 23
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> MEETING MIGHT BE GOOD IF IT IS
                            CALLED FOR THE RIGHT REASON (I.E. NOT THAT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BROKEN DOWN
                            BUT RATHER THAT COMPANIES HAD MADE AN <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> WIDE <pb n="6" xml:id="d112-06" facs="d112-06"/>OFFER
                            TO NEGOTIATE. THIS MIGHT RESULT IN CREATION OF A MEDITERRANEAN AS WELL
                            AS GULF COMMITTEE SO NEGOTIATIONS COULD GO FORWARD IN PARALLEL).
                            STRATHELMOND, ON OTHER HAND, AGREED IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WORKED OUT
                            THAT WAY ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WERE DANGERS IN THAT RADICAL
                            COUNTRIES MIGHT PRESS FULL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> MEETING
                            TO UP DEMANDS CONTAINED IN <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            RESOLUTION-120, PARTICULARLY INSOFAR AS RETROACTIVE AGREEMENTS,
                            INCREASED TAX RATES AND FORCED INVESTMENT CONCERNED. I STRESSED
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
                            TO KNOW SCORE BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON IF HE WERE TO SEEK POSTPONEMENT OF
                            JAN 23 FULL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> MEETING.</p>
                        <p>(F) BOTH <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> NEGOTIATORS WERE RATHER
                            SHAKEN BY SHAH AND <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName>'S
                            ASSERTION TO US THAT PRODUCERS WOULD ONLY AGREE TO STABILIZE PRICES FOR
                            FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IF COMPANIES AGREED NOT TO PASS ON "UNWARRANTED PRICE
                            INCREASES" TO CONSUMERS. I HAD EXPLAINED THAT AMOUZEGAR ALSO MADE CLEAR
                            THAT ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE MADE SO THIS WOULD NOT APPLY TO LEGITIMATE
                            INCREASE IN COMPANY'S ACTUAL COSTS STEMMING FROM INCREASED WAGES,ETC.
                            AND ALSO <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName>'S THOUGHT THAT
                            COMPANY DESIRES FOR PRICE INCREASES COULD BE REFERRED TO SOME MUTUALLY
                            AGREED IMPARTIAL BODY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WERE JUSTIFIED. PIERCEY
                            TOOK VIEW THAT SUCH PROVISION COULD BE USED BY GULF PRODUCERS TO JUSTIFY
                            INCREASING THEIR OWN PRICES THUS MAKING FIVE YEAR MORATORIUM INCREASE IN
                            PRODUCERS PRICES VIRTUALLY WORTHLESS. STRATHELMOND, ON OTHER HAND, SAID
                            THAT THIS WAS VERY COMPLICATED MATTER AS ANY SUCH AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE
                            TO PROTECT THE COMPANY AGAINST MANY THINGS IN ADDITION TO WAGE
                            INCREASES. FOR EXAMPLE, NEED TO WRITE OFF COMPANY INVESTMENTS. ETC. I
                            COMMENTED COMPANIES WOULD CERTAINLY FACE THIS PROPOSAL. IT WAS ONE WHICH
                            WE HAD IMPRESSION THAT SHAH FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT NOT SO MUCH IN
                            TERMS OF JUSTIFIED INCREASES BUT IN <pb n="7" xml:id="d112-07" facs="d112-07"/>TERMS OF OBSESSION IRANIANS HAVE THAT COMPANIES WILL
                            ARBITRARILY INCREASE THEIR PROFITS AT EXPENSE OF BOTH PRODUCERS AND
                            FINAL CONSUMERS.</p>
                        <p>(G) STRATHELMOND, PIERCEY AND VAN REEVEN EXPRESSED DEEP APPRECIATION FOR
                            HAVING BEEN SO THOROUGHLY BRIEFED ON ATMOSPHERE AND POSITIONS THEY WOULD
                            FACE IN THE TALKS WHICH BEGIN THIS AFTERNOON. THEY SAID IT WOULD HELP
                            THEM GREATLY TO HANDLE DISCUSSIONS IN A WAY BEST DESIGNED TO AVOID
                            RUFFLING <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> FEATHER AND THUS
                            COMPROMISING FUTURE COURSE OF DISCUSSIONS AT OPENING TALKS TODAY. WE
                            BELIEVE IT WAS A USEFUL EXERCISE AND WAS GENUINELY APPRECIATED. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, FRENCH AND DUTCH AMBASSADORS ALSO WARM
                            IN THANKS FOR BRIEFING. FOREGOING COMPANY <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S AND AMBASSADORS ALSO OF BELIEF THAT UNDER SECRETARY'S
                            TRIP HERE HAD COME AT MOST OPPORTUNE MOMENT. CONFIDENTIALLY, WE HAD
                            IMPRESSION THAT PIERCEY WHILE OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY CAPABLE MAN, SEEMS
                            SOMEWHAT MORE RIGID AND INFLEXIBLE IN HIS VIEWS THAN DID LORD

                        <p>(A) THEY CLAIM IRAN HAS NOT ABIDED BY AGREEMENTS. NEGOTIATED IN EARLY
                            FIFTIES AT END OF MOSSADEGH PERIOD:</p>
                        <p>(B) FACT THAT DESPITE EXISTING AGREEMENTS, THERE HAS FOR PAST SEVERAL
                            YEARS BEEN ANNUAL CONFRONTATION BETWEEN CONSORTIUM AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WITH <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> INSISTING ON NEW MEASURES TO INCREASE ITS BENEFITS,
                            PARTICULARLY THROUGH INCREASED OFFTAKE.</p>
                        <p>(C) SHAH'S INSISTENCE ON ESCALATION CLAUSE TO PROTECT IRAN AGAINST
                            INFLATION IN WEST IN ITSELF MEANS <pb n="2" xml:id="d113-02" facs="d113-02"/>THAT PRICE FOR OIL WHICH GULF PRODUCERS AGREE TO

                            THAT NO <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NO ASSURANCE FROM SHAH OR
                            GULF PRODUCERS IS WORTH VERY MUCH AND THAT EVEN IF AGREEMENT REACHED ON

                            TO DEPEND ON ACTUAL TERMS WHICH ARE AGREED BETWEEN TWO PARTIES.
                            YESTERDAY AMERICAN COMPANY <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S SEEMED
                            EITHER NOT WELL INFORMED OR DISINGENUOUS WHEN THEY SAID TO ME THAT
                                “<persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> HAS RAISED NEW

                            <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">IRWIN</persName> THAT INVALIDATE SHAH'S
                            ASSURANCES RE FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT.” THEY CITED AS BASIS OF THIS
                            ASSERTION IRANIAN INSISTENCE ON A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRUDE PRICES AND
                            CONSUMER PRICES. THIS PROPOSAL, AS I POINTED OUT TO THEM, (<gloss target="#t_REF1">REF</gloss> B), HAD BEEN MADE CLEAR TO <gloss target="#t_UNSEC1">UNSEC</gloss> AND ME BOTH BY SHAH AND <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> IN JAN 18 MEETING AND I HAD
                            CONVEYED IT, AS WELL AS OTHER IRANIAN POSITIONS IN DETAIL TO PIERCY AND
                            STRATHALMOND WHEN I BRIEFED THEM FOR OVER AN HOUR JAN 19 SO THAT THEY
                            WOULD KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY WOULD BE UP AGAINST.</p>
                        <p>4. IN LIGHT OF FOREGOING I DO NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT
                            THINK A QUERY OF <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> WOULD
                            ELICIT MORE THAN RENEWED ASSURANCE THAT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND OTHER <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> GULF
                            PRODUCERS ARE WILLING TO SUBSCRIBE TO A FIVE YEAR AGREEMENT IF
                            SATISFACTORY OVER-ALL AGREEMENT REACHED WITH COMPANIES. I RECOGNIZE OF

                            NATURE DO PROVIDE FOR SOME <pb n="3" xml:id="d113-03" facs="d113-03"/>CHANGE IN PRICES EVEN IF THERE IS A FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT. HOWEVER
                            COMPANY <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS AND
                            IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD TRY TO TIE DOWN IN
                            THEIR NEGOTIATIONS ON THESE POINTS TO GET BEST DEAL POSSIBLE. THEY DO
                            NOT AFFECT <hi rend="italic">SHAH</hi>'S COMMITMENT TO GIVE FIVE YEAR

                            BELIEVE COMPANY OFFER SUBSTANTIALLY TOO LOW TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO GULF
                            PRODUCERS. WE ALSO RECALL THAT <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> COMMENTED PRIVATELY TO US THAT IN BARGAINING
                            OVER POST PRICE INCREASE HE EXPECTED COMPANIES WOULD ASK A FIGURE
                            SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW WHAT GULF PRODUCERS WOULD ACCEPT, WHEREAS GULF
                            PRODUCERS WOULD ADVANCE A FIGURE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE WHAT THEY KNOW
                            COMPANIES COULD ACCEPT AND THAT THIS INVOLVED USUAL TYPE OF BARGAINING

                        <p>1. PIERCEY AS SPOKESMAN SAID COMPANIES HAD "COLLAPSED" AND MET VIRTUALLY
                            ALL <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> DEMANDS IN MEETING IN PARIS

                            STILL NOT SETTLED RELATED TO FREIGHT DIFFERENTIAL IN MEDITERRANEAN DUE
                            TO TO FAVORED GEOGRAPHIC POSITION (STATE 22654, PARA 3A). <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> GULF PRODUCERS HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN
                            POSITION THAT IF PRESENTLY JUSTIFIABLE FRIEGHT DIFFERENTIAL FOR LIBYA IS

                            INCREASED COMPARABLE AMOUNT. PIERCEY SAID COMPANIES HAD MADE AN OFFER

                            FIVE YEAR AGREEMENT. SINCE SHAH HAD GIVEN SUCH ASSURANCES TO <gloss target="#t_UNSEC1">UNSEC</gloss> IRWIN IN LATTER'S CAPACITY AS
                            PRESIDENTIAL EMMISSARY. I TOLD WRIGHT THAT IF AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN

                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> OIL: PERSIAN GULF ANCHORED,
                            MEDITERRANEAN NEXT</p>
                        <p>The international oil companies signed a new oil tax and price agreement
                            with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'s(*) six Persian Gulf members
                            in Tehran February 14 and take on <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'s Mediterranean wing next week at dates not yet known.</p>
                        <p>(*) Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries — Abu Dhabi, Algeria,
                            Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela</p>
                        <p>The Gulf agreement is for five years but some oilmen doubt that it will
                            last that long. According to preliminary reports, it gives Gulf
                            governments an immediate revenue increase of almost 30 per cent for
                            crude oil exported from Gulf terminals, with further increases through
                            1975.</p>
                        <p>Major customers affected are Western Europe, which obtains about 40 per
                            cent of its oil from Gulf terminals, and Japan, which imports almost 90
                            per cent of its oil from the Gulf. The companies have stated that the
                            full increase must be passed to consumers, some of whom do not
                            agree.</p>
                        <p>The Gulf agreement climaxed six weeks of sporadic bargaining and
                            ultimatums since publication in late December of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> Resolution <pb n="2" xml:id="d115-02" facs="d115-02"/>XXI/120. This contained demands for a minimum <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> oil tax rate of 55 per cent and
                            negotiation within 30 days of higher posted prices, the price on which
                            taxes are based regardless of actual market prices, which normally are
                            lower than tax prices. The companies countered with a demand for a
                            five-year, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>-wide agreement but
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> successfully insisted on a
                            regional approach beginning with the Persian Gulf. Because of its
                            distance from the markets, the Gulf has less bargaining power than other
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> areas but the prevailing tight
                            oil market has enhanced Gulf leverage, too.</p>
                        <p>The agreement did not end concern over a possible oil supply interruption
                            since negotiations affecting the 45 per cent of Western Europe's oil
                            obtained from Mediterranean sources have not begun in earnest. At a
                            Tripoli meeting next week demands for this "short-haul" oil will be
                            coordinated by Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The latter two
                            exempted from the Gulf agreement the oil they pipe to Eastern
                            Mediterranean ports in hope of tying its terms to those won by Libya,
                            whose demands include premium prices based on proximity to the market.
                            Algeria has been negotiating its own demands with the French government
                            for several months. Western Europe depends on Libya for 25 per cent of
                            its oil and Libya's overflowing treasury makes it theoretically
                            independent of oil revenues for extended periods. A complete oil
                            shutdown by Libya alone, if prolonged, could cause a severe oil shortage
                            so long as the Suez Canal remains closed and the tanker shortage
                            continues. The Tapline reopening is not enough to end the shortage.</p>

                        <p>Highlights of the Persian Gulf agreement are understood to be:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1) Financial adjustments:</p>
                        <p>—an increase in per barrel Gulf government revenues retro- active to
                            January 1 of about 28 cents, rising to about 34 cents June 1 and to
                            about 50 cents in 1975;</p>
                        <p>— an immediate increase of $1.3 billion in annual Gulf oil revenues,
                            growing to $3.5 billion in 1975, on top of their current annual receipts
                            of more than $4 billion;</p>
                        <p>— an increase in government revenue from exports of 34° crude (a medium
                            grade which constitutes a substantial portion of Gulf exports) to about
                            $1.25 and tax paid costs to the companies to $1.38 per barrel;</p>
                        <p>— the 28-cent initial increase comes to about 7/10 of one cent per
                            American gallon and about 2/10 of one cent per liter of crude oil.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2) Assurances from the Gulf governments that they
                            will not:</p>
                        <p>— attempt to increase per barrel revenues beyond the terms of the
                            agreement for five years;</p>
                        <p>— attempt to increase revenues if non-Gulf export terminals receive
                            better terms (no "leap-frogging”);</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d115-04" facs="d115-04"/>
                        <p>— support other <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> governments (such
                            as Libya) whose demands exceed those of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> Resolution XXI/120 plus a "reasonable" freight
                            premium;</p>
                        <p>— limit or restrict oil exported from Gulf terminals if non-Gulf
                            governments demand (a) more favorable terms (b) retroactive payments (c)
                            "unreasonable" freight differentials, so that the companies may replace
                            Libyan oil with Gulf oil if necessary, the tanker shortage
                            permitting.</p>
                        <p>In return for yielding nearly the entire 30-cent increase the Gulf
                            originally demanded the companies appear to have obtained the assurances
                            of stability they wanted, but reportedly feel insecure in these
                            assurances and would like consumer governments to reinforce them by an
                            expression of their expectation that the Gulf countries will respect
                            them. By settling when they did, the companies avoided an imposed or
                            legislated settlement which would have been difficult to alter in the
                            event their bargaining position should later substantially improve.</p>
                        <p>Lacking a clear understanding of the agreement, initial consumer reaction
                            has been cautious but West Germany has objected to absorbing the full
                            increase while Japan has expressed opposition to any increase.(*)</p>
                        <p>(*) Japan's private Arabian Oil Co. reportedly did not, sign the Gulf
                            agreement, explaining that it already pays governments more than the
                            agreement requires.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d115-05" facs="d115-05"/>
                        <p>Some consumer sources have hinted at reducing or eliminating the oil
                            company role in favor of government-to-government oil arrangements.
                            Iran's Shah touched on this in February 16 remarks stating that Iran
                            would seek to replace the companies "in a generation or so" by exploring
                            for, producing and marketing its own oil.</p>
                        <p>Producing government control appears to be the main issue in the
                            Algerian-French negotiations while Libya's initial demands include
                            mandatory reinvestment by the companies of 25 cents per barrel in Libya.
                            Other initial Libyan demands were for oil tax rates of 59-63 per cent, a
                            permanent 30-cent posted price increase and a "temporary" 35-cent posted
                            price increase tied to freight rates, the so-called "Suez premium”.
                            Libya has also rejected company efforts to negotiate as a group,
                            insisting on its right to deal with them one by one. These demands may
                            be revised in Tripoli next week to reflect the Gulf agreement. The
                            Mediterranean governments are expected to present their demands at any
                            time after that.</p>

                                attitudes of the activist youth were widespread, but that their
                                beliefs would be tempered by time. Of the suggestion that the U.S.
                                government attempt to draw nearer to the activists, Childs wrote
                                “the only way to do that would be for the United States to urge, and
                                be seen to be urging, further steps towards liberalization upon the
                                Shah. For a variety of reasons I am sure we would be most hesitant
                                to do this. Therefore I conclude that we should not worry too much
                                about the ill-informed views of activist youths. By the time they
                                reach positions of influence it should be apparent to them that the
                                United States has a lot to offer Iran.” (<gloss target="#t_NEAIRN1">NEA/IRN</gloss>, Office of Iran Affairs, Lot File 75D351, Box

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>Iran is a nation of the young. As in other developing countries, a high
                            birth rate and a decreasing infant mortality rate have combined to
                            noticeably increase the percentage of the young among the population of
                            the country. Yet, except for their age, the youth of Iran are a diverse,
                            non-homogenous group. This study of youth in Iran and their attitudes
                            does not attempt to cover the entire spectrum of young people throughout
                            the country nor to describe the full range of their beliefs and
                            attitudes. Instead, we here attempt the more manageable task of defining
                            the attitudes of an important segment of the young people in Iran and
                            discussing how these attitudes will affect the future of Iran, including
                            the all-important questions of its relations with the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d116-03" facs="d116-03"/>
                        <p>This report was prepared by a group of 11 young officers from the
                            Political, Economic and Consular sections of the Embassy, the Defense
                            Attache's office, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, our Military
                            Advisory Mission, and CAS. It represents the group's evaluation of the
                            attitudes of young Iranians, and is not meant to either reflect or speak
                            for official Mission policy. It is a completely independent undertaking;
                            the group was encouraged by senior officers in the Embassy to prepare
                            the study free from any strictures on its content.</p>
                        <p>The study naturally reflects the difficulties encountered in analyzing
                            the attitudes of a broad section of any society. Our contacts are
                            necessarily limited, and although we have attempted to stress the goal
                            of objectivity, our findings reflect the attitudes of our contacts. In
                            addition, we have described the attitudes of youth while making no
                            claims as to the validity or objectivity of those attitudes. While some
                            of their beliefs might, in our view, be unrealistic and logically
                            unsound, they are nevertheless widely held and must be considered
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The study has been divided into a number of sections to make it both
                            manageable for the drafters and readable for its recipients. The Study
                            begins with a definition of youth in Iran and their place in Iranian
                            society. This should enable the reader to better judge the importance
                            and applicability of our findings. The major section of the paper
                            defines the attitudes of Iranian youth in three areas — domestic,
                            foreign and social. The study ends with a discussion of implications for
                            American foreign policy and recommendations for changes in that
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>It is important to emphasize that the study is the result of a combined
                            effort and does not reflect the views of any one individual. A list of
                            contributors to the study follows the index. Finally, we wish to
                            re-emphasize the completely unofficial nature of the paper — it
                            represents the views of the youth group alone and should not be read as
                            an official Embassy statement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II DEFINITION OF YOUTH</p>
                        <p>Iran is highly centralized, with decision-making, presently and for the
                            foreseeable future, vested largely in Tehran and in the provincial urban
                            areas to a much lesser degree. Also, despite important strides made in
                            the emancipation of women, it is still a male-oriented and dominated
                            society. The young who will have the greatest impact on the future
                            course of Iranian life are the university students, recent graduates,
                            and those who are employed in the important sectors of private business,
                            government, the military, education, and communications. Consequently,
                            the focus of this paper is on the urban male who is working or studying
                            in one of the above mentioned areas. It is this group that will have the
                            greatest influence on the future course of the Iranian nation, and it is
                            their attitudes and beliefs which much be understood if the United
                            States hopes to continue to play a central and meaningful role in
                            Iran.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III PLACE OF YOUTH IN IRANIAN SOCIETY</p>
                        <p>The attitudes of any segment of Iranian youth depend upon their place in
                            the framework of Iranian society. Thus, a proper assessment of both
                            their present impact on the country and their future role in it requires
                            an understanding of their relationship to Iranian society and their
                            influence in that society.</p>
                        <p>54% of the people of Iran — approximately 14.5 million — are under 24
                            years of age. The literacy rate of the 7-24 year age group is 42.6%
                            compared with a literacy rate of 30% countrywide. These 14.5 million
                            Iranians do not represent the total number of those considered in this
                            report. It would be inexact and foolhardy to establish a definite age
                            limit, above which one is considered to have passed from the realm of
                            youth to another category. The Youth Committee has consequently
                            consciously avoided any rigid definition by age of youth in Iran and has
                            rather concerned itself with the attitudes of those, mostly in the urban
                            population, who are considered young by other Iranians.</p>
                        <p>An understanding of the role of youth in Iran would be incomplete without
                            an awareness of the strength of tradition in Iranian society.
                            Traditionally, decision-making in Iran has rested with the elders (or
                            "sefid-rish" - white beards) of the society. The place of youth was to
                            listen to their elders and learn from their wisdom. Any idea of
                            participation in the decision-making was never entertained. The
                            traditional society is breaking down in Iran, and this decay of the old
                            system is most evident in the urban areas. With the disappearance of the
                            traditional leadership system, a new one is emerging, one that reflects
                            an Iran increasingly subject to and aware of the influence of the West
                            and technology. With this change has come a new role for the young
                            people especially in the urban areas; for the first time in Iranian
                            history they find themselves in a position to influence, often only in a
                            limited way, the process of decision making in the country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Business Sector</p>
                        <p>The most noticeable change in the role of youth is in the business
                            sector. Formerly reserved to the bazaari class, private business in Iran
                            has been the leader in the nation's extraordinary economic expansion.
                            With this growth has come a need for well-educated young technocrats,
                            many trained in the West, to administer the commerce of the nation. Any
                            study of the attitudes of youth in Iran must pay particular attention to
                            the young managers and experts who have been in the forefront of Iran's
                            growth toward, and transformation into, a modern western-oriented
                            industrial nation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Government Sector</p>
                        <p>Under the traditional system, positions of power in the Government were
                            reserved for the prestigious families, most of whom were connected to
                            the <pb n="5" xml:id="d116-05" facs="d116-05"/>Royal families. Although
                            the bureaucracy has been less susceptible to change than the private
                            business sector, it is nevertheless feeling the forces of modernization.
                            These pressures have been met in part by employing young, well-educated
                            Iranians, who combine an understanding of their nation's needs with the
                            learning necessary to effect changes in the administration of
                            government. This has been especially evident in the realm of fiscal
                            policy and planning, e.g. the Central Bank, the Plan Organization, the
                            Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI) and the Bank
                            Melli.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Universities</p>
                        <p>Although the growing radicalism of students throughout the world has not
                            gone unnoticed in Iran, the capability of changing the educational
                            system, on the part of the students and young faculty members, is still
                            severely limited. The influence of the students is seen only in their
                            ability to disrupt the tranquility of the system. A relatively small
                            percentage of the teachers and administrators in the universities are
                            attmpting to initiate reforms in the educational system, but, for a
                            number of reasons, education has remained one of the sectors most
                            impervious to change.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communications</p>
                        <p>The communications revolution which has given a transistor radio to every
                            village hut and a television to every middle class Tehrani home, has not
                            been an opportunity for the youth of Iran to attempt independent action
                            or decision-making. Tightly controlled by the Government, the
                            communications sector does not offer youth a creative challenge. There
                            are a few, concerned, well-educated young writers on some of the Tehran
                            newspapers who command respect among the educated classes and to a small
                            degree have influence in the communications sector. Their numbers are
                            limited, however, and their role will continue to be exceedingly
                            circumscribed under present government controls.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Military</p>
                        <p>In the Iranian military establishment, as in any in the world, the young
                            officer is restricted in his power and authority. The system itself,
                            dependent on seniority and rank for the accumulation of power, tends to
                            prevent the young from playing a meaningful role. However, the military
                            is central to the stability and security of Iran and younger officers,
                            as part of this vital organization, acquire a consequent importance.
                            Furthermore, the upgrading of the Iranian military to meet the needs of
                            the 20th Century will rest with the younger career officers who are the
                            future commanders of the system. Many of them, especially in the Air
                            Force, have been trained in the West and their role will become
                            increasingly important as they are continually promoted. Since the
                            attitudes the younger officers hold today affect their future actions,
                            an understanding of these attitudes is important to an appreciation of
                            the future role of those who now are young. <pb n="6" xml:id="d116-06" facs="d116-06"/>A study of the five critical sectors of business,
                            government, education, communications, and the military shows that youth
                            is becoming increasingly important and influential in Iran. With the
                            disintegration of the traditional social and political systems, young
                            people are being given greater responsibilities and their ability to
                            influence decision making in the country, even at relatively high
                            levels, is being increasingly felt. There can be no question that an
                            understanding of the attitudes of the youth of Iran is essential for not
                            only an appreciation of how the country functions, but also in
                            considering how their attitudes will affect American foreign policy for
                            this strategically important nation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV ATTITUDES OF YOUTH</p>
                        <p>The Embassy Youth Committee, throughout this study, has been acutely
                            aware that the youth of Iran, even according to the relatively narrow
                            definition it has applied, is not an homogeneous group. In the sections
                            which follow - domestic, foreign, and social affairs - although
                            generalizations will be made when they are considered relevant, the
                            study will attempt to point out the differences in attitudes among
                            groups which do exist. Differences in the intensity of feeling on
                            various subjects among the groups being studied will also be noted.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Domestic Attitudes</p>
                        <p>The Shah - For most Iranians, including Iranian youth, the Shah is
                            accepted and taken for granted in the landscape of their lives. Many
                            cannot imagine Iran without the ubiquitous presence of His Imperial
                            Majesty. At the same time, this remarkable man is the subject of
                            curiously mixed attitudes among his people. In general, and as a
                            background, there is wide-spread respect and admiration for him among
                            all groups, including the youth of these groups; these feelings become
                            awe and veneration at the lower levels of Iranian society. However,
                            there are also wide-spread negative beliefs about the Shah which most
                            Iranians, again including youth, hold concurrently with their positive
                            feelings. These beliefs are, of course, often mutually contradictory,
                            but in some cases Iranians do not see these as contradictory in the same
                            way that they would be conceived in the West and, in other cases,
                            recognize these contradictions in themselves and find it normal that
                            their leader should have them as well. There follow examples of both
                            kinds of attitudes:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A.</p>
                        <p>1. The Shah works hard to see that Iranian government and administration
                            attain modern standards of honesty and efficiency.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah receives payoffs from those participating in large
                            transactions involving the Government of Iran and foreign firms. Most of
                            this money, as well as revenues from his lands and the Privy Purse, is
                            banked in Switzerland.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B.</p>
                        <p>1.The Shah is a clever and articulate person who has outsmarted both <pb n="7" xml:id="d116-07" facs="d116-07"/>imperialistic foreigners and
                            threatening neighbors such as Iraq and the Soviet Union;</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah serves the interests of foreign powers in return for personal
                            gain.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C.</p>
                        <p>1. The Shah has sacrificed his personal happiness and his private life to
                            ensure that the Royal Family gives Iran good and continuing
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah exercises insufficient control over his family and indeed
                            permits, encourages, and sometimes participates in, their peculations
                            and orgies.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D.</p>
                        <p>1. The Shah sincerely desires the social advancement and economic
                            development of Iran, as shown by the success of land reform and other
                            aspects of the White Revolution.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah has brought about land reform and other elements of the White
                            Revolution for his personal enrichment.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E.</p>
                        <p>1. The Shah genuinely wants to improve Iran's image in the eyes of world
                            opinion and is justifiably proud of Iran's good reputation in other
                            countries as a responsible nation.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah's international travels are used as opportunities for
                            personal excesses.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">F.</p>
                        <p>1. The Shah has an infallible intelligence system that keeps him informed
                            of the smallest details of every event in the country.</p>
                        <p>2. The Shah is detached and aloof from his people, ignorant of their
                            needs and desires, and concerned only with pursuing his dreams for the
                            country and his personal enrichment.</p>
                        <p>The perspective of youth alters the stress and emphasis of some of these
                            points. For example, sophisticated upper-class young people, are less
                            likely to accept the hackneyed traditional view of any Iranian leader as
                            a puppet manipulated by Machivellian outside forces, than are their
                            elders. On the other hand, youth is often much more outraged by stories
                            of corruption in the Court than are older Iranians. In addition, it
                            should be noted that among youth as a group, the prevalence of negative
                            or positive attitudes toward the Shah varies according to professional
                            and social level; for example, military officers, as noted below, are
                            more clearly and uniformly pro-Shah than would be characteristic of
                            other strata of youth.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d116-08" facs="d116-08"/>
                        <p>The attitudes of educated youth in Iran toward the Shah almost invariably
                            reflect Western standards, even if they realize that their society and
                            government cannot be entirely evaluated by those standards. The liberal
                            states of Western Europe and North America are measures by which young
                            Iranians judge themselves and their society. Thus, as elsewhere in the
                            world, most of the educated youth in Iran dislike living in what they
                            see as a totalitarian society. They deeply desire the civil liberties
                            which are standard in the United States and other Western nations; they
                            are annoyed that their newspapers are censored and controlled, their
                            activities subject to secret police scrutiny, their movements
                            (particularly in and out of the country) under heavy control, and the
                            free public expression of their personal opinions forbidden. They regard
                            these aspects of Iranian society and government as a direct creation of
                            the Shah. Accordingly, he is blamed by these sophisticated young
                            Iranians for the lower quality of intellectual and personal life in Iran
                            as compared to those Western societies which they have experienced or
                            learned about.</p>
                        <p>In an attitude closely related to the one immediately preceding, a large
                            number of modernized young Iranians feel strongly that the Shah is an
                            archaic figure; monarchy which rules as well as reigns seems to them old
                            fashioned and inconsistent with the standards of modern Western society
                            which Iran is applying to her economic and social development. These
                            Iranians sometimes see the Shah as an outmoded figure surrounded by
                            meretricious pomp, pursuing conventions of royalty cast off by Western
                            nations, even those which retain constitutional monarchy.</p>
                        <p>Educated Iranian youth are well aware of certain vices in the Iranian
                            tradition and in the Persian character which have made their society
                            weak. They strongly believe that the Shah's system of government and the
                            maintenance of his rule depends on his skillful use of these qualities.
                            For example, Iranians are extremely manipulative in their relations with
                            one another. Each Iranian feels himself the center of contending forces
                            exerted by those around him and tries to play these off against each
                            other. To many Iranians, and especially to aware youth, it seems clear
                            that the Shah insures his control by seeing to it that the leaders of
                            important government departments are kept in a permanent state of
                            nervous competition for imperial favor, not only with their peers in
                            other departments, but also in many cases with their own senior
                            subordinates. Thus, educated Iranian youth regards the Shah's governing
                            technique as supporting the continuing validity of manipulativeness as a
                            method of survival in Iranian society and hence, perpetuating a quality
                            which they believe stands in the way of social and political
                            modernization. Furthermore, the Shah's system of government and his
                            laxness toward his family are similarly seen by these young Iranians as
                            prolonging other decadent Iranian social and political practices such as
                            authoritarianism and nepotism.</p>
                        <p>The Empress - Young Iranians regarded Farah Diba with considerable
                            coldness and cynicism when she became the Shah's third Empress in 1959.
                            Her predecessor, <pb n="9" xml:id="d116-09" facs="d116-09"/> Soraya, had
                            been a tragic and sympathetic figure with whom many Iranian youth
                            identified. Since then, however, Queen <persName corresp="#p_PFD1">Farah</persName>'s gentleness, warmth, and genuine concern for the
                            suffering and the poor have won her considerable respect and growing
                            admiration among Iranian youth. There is a human warmth, simplicity, and
                            unpretentiousness about her which comes across to them even through the
                            rather artificial and self-conscious pomp and circumstance of the
                            Court.</p>
                        <p>Recently, we have noticed a tendency on the part of some sophisticated
                            younger members of the upper classes in Tehran who either themselves
                            have access to the Court, or are close to people who do, to regard the
                            Empress as the patient victim of court intrigues which exclude her from
                            closer contact with the Iranian people, thereby thwarting many of her
                            artistic and social projects.</p>
                        <p>The Crown Prince - The regime's campaign to promote the Crown Prince as
                            the inevitable and worthy successor to his father is still too new to
                            make any judgments as to its eventual success. The attitude of most
                            Iranians (including the nation's youth) toward the Crown Prince ranges
                            from indifference to mild interest. However, there are beginning to be
                            indications that the Crown Prince, as a symbol though not as a person,
                            is becoming the focus of the concern of those in the younger generation
                            who do not wish the rule of the House of <persName>Pahlavi</persName> to
                            be continued in its present form. They see in the Crown Prince the
                            potential for the continuation of a monarchy which rules as well as
                            reigns and which, therefore, stands in the way of the evolution of truly
                            democratic, constitutional government in Iran.</p>
                        <p>Princess <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> - The Shah's twin
                            sister enjoys a special status in the attitudes of young Iranians toward
                            the Royal Family. Because of her vivid personality, special closeness to
                            the Shah, and the large number of young men in her intimate circle,
                            rumors, and speculation about her, almost always unfavorable and in
                            spicy detail, are constantly in circulation among young Iranians.
                            Although sophisticated young Iranians discount a large proportion of the
                            rumors they, nonetheless, express concern at the weakness in the regime
                            which she represents, and disgust at the Shah's leniency with her. They
                            also share with members of their generation somewhat further down the
                            social scale a considerable and growing annoyance at the poor image
                            which the Princess has or may create for Iran abroad. Accordingly, if
                            the Princess' aspirations for high offices in international
                            organizations such as the U.N. should bring her unfavorable publicity
                            abroad, an interesting division in view is likely to develop between
                            older and younger Iranians, with the former likely to be angry at the
                            newspapers and other media concerned, while the latter will almost
                            certainly direct their anger at the Princess and the Shah.</p>
                        <p>Other Members of the Royal Family — In general, young people in Iran,
                            like other Iranians, find the numerous members of the Royal Family,
                            other than <pb n="10" xml:id="d116-10" facs="d116-10"/>the immediate
                            family of the Shah, a shadowy and vaguely distasteful group. Innumerable
                            rumors and occasional substantiated accounts, which are constantly in
                            circulation in Iran, produce, particularly among Iranian youth, a
                            general image of parasitism, constant corruption, and personal laxness.
                            The effect is rather as if in America the Jet Set or Beautiful People
                            were supported by the taxpayer. More specifically, young businessmen and
                            technocrats resent the parasitic omnipresence of the Royal Family in
                            many new major business undertakings, and the interference by members of
                            the Royal Family in new technical projects in order to derive personal
                            benefit from them.</p>
                        <p>Of the many other members of the Royal Family, only Prince Gholam Reza
                            and Prince Abdol Reza stand out. Gholam Reza has a personal following
                            among sports-minded youth and junior army officers who appreciate his
                            concern for, and support of, the interests they share with him.
                            Furthermore, as the oldest of the Shah's brothers, he enjoys a personal
                            standing and autonomy not available to the others. Abdol Reza is
                            particularly respected among young Iranians for his high personal ethics
                            and honesty which they consider to be particularly marked in contrast to
                            other members of his family. He is also respected for making a life of
                            his own and insisting on keeping it separate from the politics and
                            intrigues of the Court. This firmness is particularly admired by those
                            young Iranians who are themselves trying to make lives which they hope
                            will reflect their own values and not the decadent ones which they
                            believe prevail in their society.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister — Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>
                            is seen as the best example of what it takes to survive and achieve
                            success in contemporary Iranian politics. He is a manipulator of the
                            system, finely attuned to the political realities of Iran, and, most
                            importantly, knows his position in relation to the Shah - a low-profile
                            administrator with no overt pretensions of aggrandizing his power. Of
                            equal importance in the attitude of youth toward <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> is their belief that the Prime
                            Ministry is a position without any real power and one totally dependent
                            on the good will of the Monarch. The youth of Iran can feel real
                            antagonism only toward an element in the system which exercises real
                            power, whether an individual or an institution. The Prime Minister does
                            not fall in those categories.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> has proven useful to the
                            government as the lightening rod for criticism. He is continually
                            lampooned in the Persian humor magazines,”Towfieq" and "Karikatur”, and
                            has consequently been made the butt of caustic joking by many university
                            students. As seen from the biting humor directed at the Prime Minister,
                            the attitude of youth toward him, both as an individual and toward the
                            office itself, is one of studied indifference built on their belief that
                            he does not represent a real potential force for change in the system.
                            As a student said, "Everyone knows he just takes orders.”</p>
                        <p>As with the Shah, youth's attitude toward the Prime Minister is focused
                            on his personal qualities, and consequently his policies and
                            achievements are <pb n="11" xml:id="d116-11" facs="d116-11"/>often
                            judged as reflections of his character, not independently. This attitude
                            is a direct result of the Iranian propensity to personalize politics and
                            attitudes; that is, to judge a man's achievements on the basis of his
                            character, method of achievement, and influence rather than on the
                            merits of his policies alone.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Role of the Military</p>
                        <p>The officer corps is made up of an older group of high ranking officers
                            and an increasingly growing, younger, better educated group, many of
                            whom are from the middle class. Both groups profess complete loyalty to
                            the Shah, realizing their self interests are best served by the
                            stability and permanence of the Throne.</p>
                        <p>Many of the younger officers who have been trained and/or lived abroad,
                            chafe under the restraints of the Iranian military structure which is
                            still controlled by the older, high ranking officers. Possibilities or
                            rapid advancement do exist, however. Last year nine senior naval
                            admirals were retired and replaced with nine young naval commanders who
                            were subsequently promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral.</p>
                        <p>There is a general feeling of elitism and comraderie found among younger
                            military officers which is lacking among other young groups in Iranian
                            society. They see themselves as guardians of Iran's sovereignty, acting
                            under the Shah's orders to ensure the strength and survival of the
                            nation. Consequently, although the younger officers are aware of the
                            general public feeling of indifference toward their positions, they are
                            confident that they fulfill an essential function in Iranian life.</p>
                        <p>Strategically, the preoccupation of the younger officers, reflecting a
                            similar concern in their leaders, has turned from the Soviet borders to
                            the South and the West. With the departure of British forces from the
                            Persian Gulf, more emphasis is being placed on the defense of Iranian
                            interests in that area. The younger officers in the military are keenly
                            aware of the threat to Iranian security from Iraq, and Iran's growing
                            interests in the Gulf, and have altered their thinking accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The civilian college or university graduate does not find the possibility
                            of a military career particularly attractive. He prefers to enter the
                            expanding civilian economy rather than subject himself to the
                            uncertainties of the life of a junior officer in the armed forces,
                            subject to the whims of his superior and at a far lower pay scale.</p>
                        <p>More generally, the non-military youth of Iran view the armed services
                            with indifference and often a trace of condescension, in interesting
                            contrast to the feelings of elitism within the military itself. Rather
                            than having strong feelings about the military's role in Iran, the
                            younger people tend to not think about the military establishment,
                            unless it affects them personally — e.g. when the military is used to
                            control student demonstrations or when a <pb n="12" xml:id="d116-12" facs="d116-12"/>young man becomes eligible for the draft. The latter
                            is a frequent issue, because the low pay — 50 Dials ($.64) per month —
                            and poor treatment by American standards lead educated Iranians to go to
                            almost any lengths to avoid service as an enlisted man. There are many
                            cases of young men using influence and/or money to avoid military
                            conscription.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Parliament and Political Parties</p>
                        <p>The youth of Iran view political parties as arbitrary groupings of myriad
                            interest groups which are imposed from the top and not as a natural
                            outgrowth of Iran's social patterns and history. These artificial
                            entities will remain cohesive only so long as they have the support of
                            the Shah; they cannot be considered political parties in the true sense
                            of the word — groupings of individuals with common interests and the
                            willingness and ability to express those interests on the national stage
                            through a flexible political system. The Majles, which is the sum of the
                            present political parties, has no prestige among the youth of Iran, and
                            its members have power and influence only so far as their family and
                            personal connections provide it.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian educational and social system is not conducive to producing
                            young people who are disciplined enough to accept political
                            responsibility. In early childhood, Iranians receive little or no
                            discipline in the home. They enter a primary and secondary school system
                            in which grades are negotiable and standards flexible. Their teachers,
                            severely underpaid, are from a low social class and command little or no
                            respect. In the universities they are catered to in order to avoid any
                            possibilities of their disrupting the stability of the educational
                            system. Once an Iranian youth reaches adulthood he is most responsive to
                            one kind of authority — absolute. All other authority is circumvented
                            and undermined. This type of individual is a poor building block for a
                            democratic state. Although Iranian youth view the political parties and
                            the Majles with cynicism and uninterest, and profess preferences for a
                            more open system, they are themselves presently capable of giving Iran
                            only very limited and circumscribed alternatives to the existing
                            political system.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Information Media</p>
                        <p>The media in Iran are viewed critically by the young people of the
                            country. Passive censorship is evident, especially in sensitive issues
                            such as the Royal Family or the Persian Gulf. There is frequent
                            editorializing on the front pages of even the larges dailies. Criticism
                            of local officials is undoubtedly welcome, but the media is suspected of
                            making such criticism merely to exhibit a pseudo-independence.
                            International coverage, generally taken from the major wire services
                            which give an air of authenticity to a report, is also suspected of
                            being edited or biased. TV and radio programming are considered
                            entertaining, but certainly not politically or socially relevant.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d116-13" facs="d116-13"/>
                        <p>Although young people view BBC and the VOA as more credible sources of
                            news, they too are suspect, partly because of their respective
                            governmental affiliations and partly because of the pervasive Persian
                            cynicism. The ARMISH-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> radio and
                            television station has a certain credibility as an outside source, but
                            still retains its biased nature in most eyes due in part to its
                            existence as an arm of the American military. Sophisticated viewers
                            regard its normal programming as neither representative of America nor
                            edifying.</p>
                        <p>An exception to this list is the humor magazine "Towfiq" which carries on
                            the "Punch" tradition in Iran. By the rules of the game, it avoids the
                            Royal family and for the most part the military, but has become widely
                            read and accepted for its satirical treatment of other personalities and
                            institutions in Iranian government and society. It has served a very
                            valid purpose - an outlet for public indignation - and has allowed the
                            young people to see their leaders as real people with real problems. It
                            allows the youth of Iran to say and see through laughter what it cannot
                            criticize through indignation.</p>

                            him to implement his programs unimpeded; youth knows that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> has the power and the will to carry

                        <p>Although Iranian youth are generally dissatisfied with the present system
                            of Government, and desire a change, their hopes for the future are
                            nebulous and not [<hi rend="italic">do?</hi>] not reflect any particular
                            political philosophy. The thread of an anarchistic "change for change's
                            sake,” noticeable among Western European and American students, is not
                            found in Iran, but the wistful longing for an open politcal system more
                            receptive to the needs of the nation's youth, is nevertheless
                            present.</p>

                        <p>Although concerned Iranian youth are not generally able to articulate
                            with any degree of exactness their wishes for changes in the system of
                            government, a number of themes pervade their comments. Their desire for
                            change is often motivated by the knowledge that a more open and freer
                            system would be advantageous to their own personal advancement rather
                            than a belief that such a system is inherently beneficial. Consequently
                            they desire reforms such as the loosening of central authority with the
                            concomitant greater degree of decentralization. Their hope, perhaps a
                            naive one, is that the venality so prevalent in the presently highly
                            centralized system will be less evident in a more diffuse form of
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>The aware young urban dweller favors a system of government where
                            promotions to the top are more dependent upon individual ability than is
                            evident in the present system. He views the administration of government
                            especially, and business to a lesser extent, as requiring familial or
                            personal connections in order to succeed. He believes a more "western"
                            type of government would afford him greater access to the top, granted
                            on the basis of his own individual abilities.</p>
                        <p>A constant theme in the desires of involved youth is for a more
                            "democratic" state. However, they are not able to specify what this
                            implies for Iran, other than generalized statements about greater
                            "freedom" and openness. Democracy is an alien concept in Iranian
                            history; it is a western invention that, without considerable change and
                            adaption, is not really relevant to the needs of Iran. However, the
                            young people of the country see the affluence and freedom of their
                            western peers and believe that the adoption of a similar political
                            system will result in the same perquisites in Iran.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indigenous Arabs and the Tribes</p>
                        <p>Iranians are surrounded by a comfortable aura of cultural and ethical
                            superiority when they consider their neighbors, be they Turk, Afghan or
                            Arab. This attitude is reflected in the feelings of distrust and
                            suspicion directed by most Iranians at the indigenous Arab population.
                            Though youth's views are somewhat moderated in comparison with their
                            elders', attitudes of condescension and cultural superiority toward the
                            Arabs are nevertheless prevalent. This arrogance toward, and fear of,
                            the Arabs has resulted in their being relagated to second class status
                            in Iran.</p>
                        <p>There are some indications that the youth of Iran is becoming more
                            sympathetic to the plight of Iranian Arabs, but any real change
                            resulting from this increased sympathy will certainly be slow in coming
                            and will probably depend more on external factors, such as improved
                            relations between Iran and its Arab neighbors.</p>
                        <p>Youth's attitudes toward the indigenous tribes are somewhat ambivalent.
                            The old arrogance of the Iranian toward the tribesmen remains, but there
                            is also <pb n="15" xml:id="d116-15" facs="d116-15"/>admiration for the
                            simplicity of life and maintenance of traditions among the tribes,
                            untouched by progress and its attendant problems. There is also a degree
                            of sympathy for the tribal minorities, and a greater willingness to help
                            them and accept their cultural differences, than there is for the Arabs.
                            There is a general feeling that the tribes have always been part of the
                            Iranian homeland and will eventually be assimilated into Iran. The
                            reverse is true of the indigenous Arabs, however, and the suspicion
                            remains that their loyalties lie elsewhere.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communism</p>
                        <p>Classicial communist doctrine appeals to a very small portion of Iranian
                            youth, and its followers are almost all found in the academic world.
                            During the early 1950s, communism had a much wider appeal, and many of
                            its doctrines were incorporated into the National Front programs of that
                            era. However, since then, its following has continued to decrease and
                            today the Communist Party of Iran (Tudeh), has a miniscule membership,
                            the majority of whom are probably Government intelligence officers who
                            have infiltrated the party.</p>
                        <p>During the past five years, there have been defections from the Tudeh
                            Party to the more radical, Chinese Communist-influenced wing of the
                            party. This has been especially true of Iranian students in Western
                            Europe who share the young radicals' disdain for the "conservatism" of
                            classical communism and are attracted by the activism of a more radical
                            doctrine. However, the number of students who are dedicated to the
                            principles of communism, either the Soviet or Chinese brand, is minimal.
                            Students contend that the often vociferous anti-Shah pronouncements and
                            actions by many Iranian students in Europe is basically anti-Shah in
                            nature and not based upon any dedication to the principles of
                            communism.</p>
                        <p>The last Iranian bastion of the study of societies according to classical
                            communist doctrine is found in the literature faculties in Iranian
                            universities. Some of the professors analyze and criticize the
                            literature being studied in Marxist terms rather than according to the
                            more objective studies used in Western universities. This may be partly
                            due to the mass of Soviet printed literature, including works by Western
                            authors, supplied to Iranian bookshops by the extensive and low-cost
                            Soviet book publishing program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">United States</p>
                        <p>The attitude of Iranian youth toward the United States is marked by a
                            number of contradictions. There has been among modern young Iranians
                            generally an awareness of, and respect for, the civil liberties and
                            freedoms found in American society, and a deep appreciation for the
                            technological expertise Iran has gained from the United States. There is
                            general admiration for the <pb n="16" xml:id="d116-16" facs="d116-16"/>“democratic way of life" as exemplified by America, and also an
                            appreciation for American innovativeness, spontaneity and
                            pragmatism.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, a number of disturbing trends in the attitudes of
                            young technocrats, academicians and university students toward America
                            which may damage US-Iranian relations in the long-term. The feeling of
                            national pride and xenophobia, which has increased concurrently with
                            Iran's economic and political growth, is especially prevalent among the
                            urban youth of the country. This distrust of foreign influences in Iran,
                            combined with a historical susceptibility to a belief in a net of
                            foreign intrigue and machinations controlling Iran, together with
                            specific criticisms of America, has diminished respect and admiration
                            for the United States among some university students and young
                            academicians. The attitudes vary considerably, of course, depending upon
                            the youth group being considered. Among young businessmen, the feelings
                            of admiration for America are still considerable. Young military
                            officers are appreciative of American assistance, training and the role
                            we have held as protector of the "Free World”, whereas university
                            students tend to be more critical of our place as a world power.</p>
                        <p>However, while respect for America is remaining fairly constant, dislike
                            of America is growing among youth, especially among students. A number
                            of isolated instances support this thesis. In one faculty of the
                            University of Tehran, the administration removed <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> handout material from a public place
                            at student insistence. Students have become more vocal and open in their
                            criticism of the United States in discussions with Embassy officers.</p>
                        <p>The attitudes of Iranian youth toward America are closely tied to our
                            involvement in Southeast Asia. Dr. Mahmoud Ziai, Chairman of the Majles
                            Foreign Relations Committee, who is pro-American and highly respected as
                            an astute observer of Iranian politics, has said to an Embassy officer
                            that the U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia has done great, perhaps
                            irreparable harm to the image and reputation of the U.S. among the
                            younger generation in Iran. This damage was done gradually over the
                            years after 1965, as the U.S. involvement in Asia deepend.</p>
                        <p>This distrust has been nutured by two factors. First, the younger
                            generation, especially university students, has tended to accept the
                            simplistic Marcusean-Marxian view of the American economy: i.e. it is
                            fed on immense defense expenditures and depends on a substantial degree
                            of economic exploitation of under-developed countries. In this view,
                            Viet Nam offered us the opportunity to continue our massive defense
                            expenditures and at the same time engage in the classical exploitation
                            of a poor country. A second factor is the cynicism the younger
                            generation feels toward the American contention that it is fighting in
                            Viet Nam for a world in which freedom, and respect for others should be
                            standards of international conduct.</p>
                        <p>Growing student dissatisfaction with America, and both its domestic and
                            international policies, has been muted by a conscious <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy to control <pb n="17" xml:id="d116-17" facs="d116-17"/>internal dissent. However,
                            criticism and dissatisfaction with the United States is growing,
                            especially among students, and there are no indications this trend will
                            be reversed in the near future.</p>

                        <p>The attitudes of Iranian youth toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cover a wide range from apprehension to admiration,
                            vary among the different youth groups, and are constantly in flux.
                            Although younger Iranians do not share their parents' vivid
                            recollections of Soviet troops occupying northern Iran and establishing
                            puppet states in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, they are very aware of the
                            Soviet Union's power and proximity to Iran.</p>
                        <p>Young military officers, western oriented by their training, equipment
                            and U.S. advisors, see the Soviet Union as a power foreign to their
                            culture and to their military methods. At the same time, they are fully
                            aware of the military might of the Soviets and hope to exist in peaceful
                            coexistence rather than in a situation of tension. They realize their
                            incapability to withstand a major Soviet offensive and look to other
                            nations for assistance, particularly the United States, if such an event
                            were to take place.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arab States</p>
                        <p>Like their Government, Iranian youth normally view the Arab States as
                            divided into two groups - radical leftist and traditional monarchial.
                            Unlike their government, however, there is little admiration or respect
                            among youth for Arab States in either of the two camps. The radical
                            leftist states are viewed as uncultured and uncivilized, bordering on
                            the barbaric, with little to offer Iran in economic, social or political
                            terms. The traditional states are dismissed as anachronistic, though
                            youth equivocates somewhat in this judgment. They realize that the
                            traditional states are Iran's best friends in the Arab World, and that
                            it is clearly in Iran's interest to maintain cordial relations with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Considered together, the Arab States are viewed somewhat more
                            malevolently. The potential threat of a united Arab World is not lost on
                            Iranian youth. This, combined with the historic enmities resulting from
                            cultural, social, ethnic, linguistic, and even religious differences
                            between Iran and the Arab World, leaves the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> room to exploit these to its own ends should it so

                        <p>A survey of the social values of Iranian youth reveals that despite the
                            facade of modernization, the differences separating young Iranians from
                            their sires are no greater than, and perhaps even less than, in the
                            West. A confrontation of the type found in Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons"
                            is considerably more socially enlightened than could be found in most of
                            the Iranian families with which this report is primarily concerned.</p>

                        <p>One of the most consistent and, to the Western eye, dismaying
                            characteristics of Iranian young people is their proclivity to accept
                            the virtue of "opportunism”. This holds true throughout all strata of
                            society. With Iran's phenomenal record of economic growth over the past
                            several years, young, trained Iranians have returned from abroad and
                            have tried to fit themselves into the existing social and economic
                            structure. In the business world, for example, they are not content to
                            make reasonable profits, but are anxious and almost proud to exploit
                            opportunities to the maximum in the short-run, striving for profit
                            margins ranging from two or three-fold a year to outright "gouging”.</p>
                        <p>Neither in government nor the professions are they satisfied with
                            low-grade positions, but demand and many times receive at least
                            middle-grade positions far beyond their years or level of competence.
                            Should Iran's economy falter, it is doubtful that many of them would be
                            willing to see it through, but rather, would more likely think seriously
                            of leaving in droves to greener pastures in their second homes
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Social Responsibility</p>
                        <p>There is little receptivity to the idea of the "common good”. Despite the
                            Shah's already-instituted, but limited programs of social welfare (e.g.
                            social insurance and medical insurance) there is little faith among
                            young people that these systems will work. Rather, they are seen as more
                            programs through which bureaucrats and those in positions of power can
                            line their own pockets with little or nothing left for the intended
                            beneficiary. Many modern young Iranians have only marginal sympathy for
                            the poor or homeless who are not members of their extended family.
                            Although the tradition of charity has always been a part of their
                            religion and culture, they salve what pangs of conscience they might
                            experience through sudden, emotionally-triggered acts of individual
                            charity, and thus ignore the efficacy of broad programs of social
                            progress.</p>

                            of the "liberation of women”. Even in modern Tehran, there is little
                            mixing of the sexes until university years. Girls are viewed as objects
                            of beauty and pleasure, not unlike a fine Persian carpet. Dating in
                            Tehran may lead to sexual relations, but almost invariably the young
                            conqueror will cast aside his prey, and demand virginity of the woman
                            that is later chosen for him to marry. Young men still support the
                            traditional view that a wife's place is in bed, at home, and bearing and
                            rearing their children.</p>
                        <p>This ageless philosophy produces an extremely strong family system, the
                            importance of which cannot be overstated. Family ties can still be found
                            as the underlying rationale for many economic and social decisions, and
                                <pb n="19" xml:id="d116-19" facs="d116-19"/>there is very little
                            desire among Iranian youth (male or female) to change this solid
                            foundation rock of Persian society.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Attitudes Toward Work</p>
                        <p>Manual labor of itself has never been accorded any intrinsic worth in
                            this part of the world, and though there are inchings toward improving
                            the lot of the laborer, Iran's present younger generation is not
                            prepared to accept the fundamental changes in this attitude which some
                            Western observers feel are essential to Iran's long-range economic and
                            political stability. While some Iranians educated abroad return with a
                            fervor of pride for an honest day's work (albeit not manual), many are
                            in due course co-opted into the system and become satisfied to put
                            prestige ahead of productivity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Place of Law</p>
                        <p>Even for young Iranians, although they profess an admiration for western
                            democratic institutions, laws seem to be made to be obfuscated and
                            circumvented. While there are some hopeful signs (village Houses of
                            Justice) that the rule of law will someday have meaning in Iran, this
                            will not be achieved unless stability can be maintained for at least
                            several more generations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Education</p>
                        <p>Higher education is greatly valued in Iran both for the respect affored
                            diploma holders and the employment possibilities it makes available.
                            Higher education overseas is valued even more, for a degree from a
                            foreign university is even more prestigious than one from an Iranian
                            university. Respect for foreign education is wide-spread throughout
                            Iranian society, and graduates from foreign schools have more employment
                            opportunities than their counterparts who are products of the Iranian
                            educational system. There consequently exists among the
                            Iranian-educated, resentment against those who have studied abroad and
                            against what is seen as the special perquisites offered them.</p>
                        <p>It has been claimed that Iranian students want the best possible
                            education for the least possible work. Although this is an
                            over-simplification, Iranian students are accustomed to working in an
                            educational environment that caters to them as long as they do not
                            threaten the stability of the system. Consequently, dedication to
                            academic discipline and an appreciation for education as a benefit by
                            itself is very limited among the youth of Iran.</p>
                        <p>The more astute Iranian students want sweeping administrative changes in
                            the educational system. They would prefer a greater decentralization of
                            the educational bureaucracy which would give local schools and
                            universities a greater say in their own administration and enable them
                            to more effectively meet local needs and conditions. They also realize
                            that the system of <pb n="20" xml:id="d116-20" facs="d116-20"/>secondary
                            education must be reformed, since the present method of teaching and
                            learning by rote gives students a woefully inadequate preparation for
                            university studies where, to a greater degree, they must learn to apply
                            the facts they have learned.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Religion</p>
                        <p>There has been a noticeable and unexpected growth of interest in religion
                            among a small segment of the youth of Iran, especially those studying
                            and teaching in the Universities. The Islamic students union is strong
                            on all university campuses and attendance at the Tehran University
                            Mosque is continually increasing.</p>
                        <p>The increased interest in religion is basically conservative in nature
                            and a reaction against Westernization, rather than a positive
                            renaissance of religion on the campuses. A small number of students have
                            also embraced religious orthodoxy as a means of criticizing the Shah and
                            his method of rule in Iran. Criticisms of the Shah which might be
                            unacceptable in a secular context, can often be voiced under cover of an
                            interest in strengthening the role of religion in Iranian life.</p>
                        <p>The vicissitudes of Western technology and the inroads made by Western
                            culture have led many students to turn to religious conservatism and
                            orthodoxy as a reaction against the trials of modernization and
                            urbanization. Consequently, the growth of religious consciousness is not
                            expected to lead to renewed interest in a Pan-Islamic movement among
                            Iranian students or faculty. Not only does the usual Sunni-Shi'ite split
                            militate against the growth of Pan-Islamism in Iran, but the basically
                            conservative, inward-looking, anti-foreign basis for the revival of
                            interest in religion in Iran among the young educated classes precludes
                            the new interest from becoming a positive force for modernization or
                            change in the country.</p>
                        <p>It is necessary to re-emphasize that this growth of interest is on a
                            small scale and affects an extremely limited percentage of the student
                            body. It is interesting, however, as an indication of one of the
                            possible paths reaction against Westernization and modernization can
                            take in the Iranian society.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Population and Birth Control</p>
                        <p>A few Westernized youths regard birth control and family planning as
                            necessary parts of social planning and are therefore concerned about the
                            issue. For the rest apathy on the issue is general, except that it is
                            considered a "modern" practice to follow. Personally, most Westernized
                            young Iranians do not want large families and know how to avoid
                            them.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. FOREIGN POLICY</p>
                        <p>The attitudes of Iranian youth are important to our policy toward Iran
                            because there is every indication that these attitudes will persist even
                            as youth grows older. Even those who join the system and appear to be
                            co-opted often have in fact, submerged rather than abandoned their
                            earlier feelings. The attitudes which this report has discussed at
                            length may be summarized for the present purpose as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Acceptance of or resignation to the present situation, for the time
                            being.</p>
                        <p>2. A strong yearning for democratization, civil liberties, and a general
                            opening and freeing of Iranian life.</p>
                        <p>3. A desire among a substantial portion of Iranian youth not to see the
                            Pahlavi dynasty - with its present power - continue after the present
                            Shah, even though the concept of a Monarch who reigns but does not rule,
                            has broader acceptance.</p>
                        <p>4. A powerful urge for greater national self-respect, independence, and
                            realization of identity.</p>
                        <p>If, as is our premise here, we must have a greater sensitivity to these
                            feelings, whether open or covert, in Iran's future leaders, our assets
                            in so doing are the admiration of young Iran for American ideals and
                            democracy and for the openess, vitality, and dynamism of our society and
                            our national life. Our hindrances are the very close identification of
                            the United States with the Shah and with both the structure and the
                            methods of his rule. There is no noticeable feeling among young, urban
                            Iranians that the United States encourages, or even approves in
                            principle of, democratization in Iran. Instead there is a general
                            feeling, that the United States prizes democracy for itself, but regards
                            Iranians as a people unable to implement democracy, and in any case
                            finds a totalitarian regime in Iran easier to work with or to
                            manipulate. A number of possible events in Iran including the actual
                            achievement of gradual democratization, could bring to positions of real
                            power persons who had acquired these attitudes toward the United States
                            in their youth. It is therefore imperative that we attack the bases of
                            these attitudes wherever possible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>A number of steps could be taken immediately which would enhance our
                            ability to deal effectively with the younger generation of Iranians
                            without detracting from our close ties with the Government of Iran. We
                            believe the following recommendations should receive careful
                            consideration as possible ways of building a more dynamic foreign policy
                            in Iran, complementing our present activities, and making us more
                            responsive to the needs and aspirations of the future leaders of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>1. We strongly support the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> plan to
                            move the Abraham Lincoln Library from <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> premises to the Iran-America Society Cultural Center.
                            The move <pb n="22" xml:id="d116-22" facs="d116-22"/>will strengthen the
                                <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> by broadening its services to
                            the young people of Tehran and will increase the library's credibility
                            by placing it under the bi-national <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss>
                            rubric. Also, <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> plans to use a section
                            of the library building for a collection of books which will include
                            English language works on Iran by non-American authors. This will
                            increase its usefulness and help to reaffirm our interest in Iranian
                            studies.</p>
                        <p>2. One of the most important elements of our <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> program in Iran is the publication of "Marzhaye-Now"
                            (New Frontiers), a monthly, Persian language magazine which receives
                            wide distribution in country. It is distributed to a selective mailing
                            list of 24,000 people, and contains articles on events and programs in
                            both the United States and Iran, with a preponderance of the former. The
                            total cost of producing Marzhaye-Now is about $.20 per copy, or
                            approximately $4,800 per month for a production run of 24,000 copies.
                            Considering the generally high-level audience the magazine reaches, the
                            yearly production cost of approximately $57,000, and the fact that the
                            magazine is the only US Government publication read by many Iranian
                            youth, we believe certain steps could be taken to ensure the increased
                            effectiveness of the program.</p>
                        <p>The magazine should give greater emphasis to Iranian programs with
                            American input which directly benefit the Iranian people. There are a
                            number of possibilities ranging from university education through city
                            planning to agricultural development programs built upon the foundation
                            of earlier US Government assistance. More articles could be carried
                            stressing concepts of development rather than specific programs in the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The current news content of the magazine should have a different
                            emphasis. One must question the image, in the eyes of Iranian youth, of
                            a US Government publication which carries stories on Princess <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>, but does not include articles
                            about successful participatory democracy in Iran (e.g. rural houses of
                            justice, arbitration councils, etc.).</p>
                        <p>Finally, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> should recommend that
                            their Publications Officer position be classified as language essential.
                            Since this officer is responsible for Marzhaye-Now, greater control of
                            the magazines editorial content could be realized by having a Persian
                            speaking American officer as editor. As an alternative, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> might consider establishing a
                            full-time position for a locally hired Iranian to edit the magazine.</p>
                        <p>3. The US Government presently gives administrative and financial
                            support, through the <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss>, to a student
                            center at Tehran University. This assistance is approximately $38,400
                            per year. In this time of budget stringencies and scarce resources, we
                            believe serious consideration should be given either to greatly
                            increasing the usefulness of the Center to the US Government or to
                            terminating our support.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="d116-23" facs="d116-23"/>
                        <p>There are advantages to continuing our support for the Center. It is one
                            of our few points of contact with university students from the lower and
                            middle classes. Most of the students who visit the Center are aware of
                            its American support and appreciate our assistance. However, events may
                            provide equally strong arguments for terminating our aid. The
                            responsibility for establishing and administering student centers should
                            rest with the local universities, not an affiliate of the United States
                            government. Tehran University is presently planning to establish a
                            student center on campus. If the plans are realized, we recommend that
                            our support for the <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> sponsored
                            student center be phased out over a one year period.</p>
                        <p>If the university does not open a student center, we believe the role the
                            mission plays in the <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> student
                            center's administration should be carefully studied with the aim of
                            either upgrading its effectiveness or, if this is not feasible,
                            withdrawing our aid. The Student Center is not similar to the <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> Cultural Center in that we have
                            complete administrative and programming control in the latter whereas
                            our programming input in the Student Center is negligible. It should be
                            noted that the minimal amount of programming is due to <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>' limited resources. The problems of
                            allocating limited <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> resources
                            transcends the Student Center; however, if <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> does not receive increased budgetary allocations and
                            personnel positions in order to overcome the problems of resource
                            allocation, we question the advisability of continued support for the
                            Student Center. Quality programming must be made available to the center
                            if we are to continue allocating scarce fiscal resources which might be
                            better employed elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Our cultural exchange program is a cornerstone of our relations with
                            Iran. Both visits to Iran by American artists, lecturers and scholars,
                            and sending Iranians to the States - from District Governors to
                            University administrators - give us immeasurable benefits by increasing
                            Iranian understanding of the United States and bringing to Iran what is
                            best in American art, culture and scholarship. Our entire cultural
                            exchange program, however, is woefully underbudgeted. It has suffered
                            much more from budgetary cutbacks than many other programs.
                            Consequently, one of our most effective means of increasing contact and
                            communication with the young people of Iran has been severely
                            restricted.</p>
                        <p>We believe increased high level interest and pressure to raise our <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> allotment for the coming fiscal years
                            could help in ameliorating this problem. It is obvious that the <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> program is merely one of many that have
                            suffered, and we cannot press for budgetary increases across the board
                            without decreasing our credibility. However, we feel the <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> program is of such importance that with
                            increased support, both in the field and in Washington, the program
                            could be more adequately funded, thereby greatly increasing its
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Academic Center</p>
                        <p>The Iran-America Society Academic Center - where about 10,000 Iranians
                            studied English last year - is the point of greatest direct contact
                            between Iranian youth and the official American presence in Iran. One of
                            the main purposes of the Center is to generate funds to support other
                                <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> activities <pb n="24" xml:id="d116-24" facs="d116-24"/>(i.e. - The Cultural and Student
                            Centers). The first six months of this fiscal year, the Academic Center
                            received approximately $200,000 in income from tuitions while spending
                            about $150,000 in administrative costs.</p>
                        <p>By de-emphasizing the money-raising nature of the Academic Center, it is
                            probable that its English teaching program could be improved. Although
                            the Center is still considered the best location in Tehran to learn
                            English, and its staff is conscientious and hard-working, there are
                            certain deficiencies which could be remedied by increased funding. The
                            Center teachers are very underpaid compared to other English teaching
                            institutions in Tehran, and programs to improve teaching material also
                            suffer.</p>
                        <p>Although there are many demands on funds for the entire <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> establishment, and any change in
                            allocations must be judged in light of the overall <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> need, consideration should be given to
                            alloting a greater portion of <gloss target="#t_IAS1">IAS</gloss> income
                            to the Academic Center and using the increased budget to raise teachers'
                            salaries and generally improve the teaching system. A more effective and
                            meaningful English teaching program would be favorably received by the
                            numerous young Iranians who attend classes at the Center.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic/Commercial</p>
                        <p>The attitudes toward foreigners generally which are shared by youth, and
                            especially the Iranian readiness to suspect that foreign companies are
                            exploiting them, all of which have been previously described in this
                            report, lead foreign firms, including American ones, to make their
                            activities as unobtrusive as possible. This means that the generally
                            excellent record of American companies here as good, socially
                            responsible citizens of Iran who contribute to Iran's economic
                            development goes largely unappreciated, especially by youth.</p>
                        <p>However, there are certain steps which our companies can take now without
                            running headlong into persisting attitudes or the sensitivities of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Scholarships for education or
                            training in the U.S. are now given mostly by the oil companies. Other
                            U.S. companies hould do much more of this. It is an excellent way of
                            satisfying both their need for qualified employees and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s intense drive for maximum
                            Iranization. For us, it is another partial answer to the dream of
                            foreign education which is cherished by so many Iranian youth.</p>
                        <p>Next in importance to this is the way U.S. firms here conduct their
                            business with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and with other
                            companies. We have already noted that deviousness and dissimulation are
                            two traditional Iranian characteristics which modernizing youth in Iran
                            would like to discard. At the same time, some U.S. companies have found
                            that a straightforward American-style approach to their dealings here
                            has been successful. For example, Reading &amp; Bates, a drilling
                            company, <pb n="25" xml:id="d116-25" facs="d116-25"/>put aside the
                            traditional methods proposed to it for settling a tax dispute in favor
                            of insisting that the appeals procedure provided for in Iranian law be
                            followed to the letter. With the help of the Embassy, this approach was
                            successful. Other companies have found like success in having important
                            representations made by a company officer, either American or Iranian,
                            rather than by the traditional "go-between”. Still other firms have
                            shown considerable foresight and courage by tactfully avoiding having to
                            take in members of the Royal Family and the Court as "silent partners.”
                            Actions such as these rapidly become known among wide circles of the
                            more sophisticated Iranian youth. Obviously, sensitive business judgment
                            is necessary as to which technique to use when. However, when Americans
                            are able to follow their own standards in matters like these, the
                            response by aware youth is deeply favorable. The Embassy and the
                            Departments of State and Commerce should coordinate their encouragement
                            of American companies to follow good American business practice in Iran
                            wherever possible, and to grant more scholarships to young Iranians.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military</p>
                        <p>Our military advisory effort, the heart of our relationship with Iran,
                            has, like other programs here, suffered from budgetary and personnel
                            cutbacks. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has gone through a
                            number of painful exercises designed to reallocate its reduced resources
                            to best meet the goals of our bilateral relationship with Iran. We
                            believe that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Armed Forces
                            Radio and Television Service should be closely studied to determine ways
                            to improve its programming and to lower its profile in order to meet the
                            fiscal and personnel pressures on our advisory effort. Many of Tehran's
                            urban youth watch the station and their image of the United States is
                            directly affected by the level of its programming and the station's
                            close identification with the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The Armed Forces Radio Service in Tehran serves a useful function and,
                            aside from its entertainment and informational activities, could be
                            justified on the basis of its potential usefulness in an emergency
                            situation. The television service is more questionable, however. It
                            cannot be justified on the quality of its programming, which is
                            extremely low for a number of reasons. One of these is that Iranian
                            television stations have first choice on contracting for American
                            television shows and the Armed Forces station must choose from what is
                            left. Consequently, the television programming gives a false impression
                            of American life, is extremely unedifying, and reflects very low
                            standards of communications skills. Studies should be made of the
                            availability of educational television programs for use by the
                            television station and a greater number of major documentaries could
                            also be screened.</p>
                        <p>In addition to improving programming, United States Government
                            identification with the station should be reduced to a minimum. Many
                            Iranian youth see <pb n="26" xml:id="d116-26" facs="d116-26"/>the
                            station as a proof of omnipresent American "imperialism" and indication
                            of our cultural and communal isolation. In keeping with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doctrine, we believe it would be
                            advantageous to have the station advertise itself as an English language
                            television station with minimal reference to its affiliation with the
                            United States. Although this would be merely a cosmetic change not
                            affecting the real ownership of the station, it would greatly help in
                            reducing our image as an arrogant independent television owner in Iran
                            while still providing the benefits an English language television
                            service offers to all the English speaking people in Tehran, especially
                            the young.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Consular</p>
                        <p>1. Officers in the Consular section often feel that they are the "poor
                            cousins" of their Embassy colleagues; they experience both a physical
                            and informational isolation from the Embassy. Consular affairs play an
                            extremely important role in our relations with Iran. Often the only
                            American officers a young Iranian ever meets are consular officers who,
                            by the very nature of their work, have extensive contacts with young
                            people. It is essential that our consular officers have the widest
                            possible understanding of our role in Iran if they are to make a
                            favorable impression on the young Iranians they meet.</p>
                        <p>A program should be adopted of regularly scheduled briefings for Consular
                            officers on political and economic matters. This would assist in
                            obviating the sense of isolation in the Consulate and would also ensure
                            that consular officers have a better understanding of the totality of
                            American interests in Iran. A conscious effort should be made to ensure
                            that consular officers are kept appraised of important developments in
                            American-Iranian relations.</p>
                        <p>2. Finally, the four officer positions in the section should be
                            classified language essential. The officers' direct contact with Iranian
                            youth is severely hampered by working through an interpretor. Also
                            meeting with Persian-speaking consular officers would significantly
                            increase the respect of young Iranians for our Embassy in general.</p>

                        <p>1. Our impact on younger Iranians is directly related to the style of our
                            diplomatic activity in Iran. Too often, we give the impression that our
                            special relationship is not with Iran as a country, but rather
                            exclusively with the Shah. In our statements and diplomatic behavior
                            there must be much more about the Iranian people and nation. when praise
                            is given and appreciation expressed, it should be to Iran as a nation
                            and to its people. Our informational activities should give greater
                            emphasis to America's role as a partner in Iran's development and
                            highlight the growth of democratic institutions in Iran and give less
                            emphasis to reporting our close involvements with the Royal Family -
                            especially the more disliked members of the dynasty.</p>

                        <p>Senior officers of the Embassy should spend more time visiting economic
                            enterprises and political institutions outside of Tehran. The Economic
                            Counselor or Commercial Attache could visit provincial industries and
                            establish relations with the young well-trained engineers who administer
                            them. The Political Counselor could visit Provincial and District
                            Councils and Arbitration Courts and confer with their members. Similar
                            trips could be made by the Public Affairs Counselor, and such activities
                            would greatly add to our image of a nation interested in the people of
                            Iran and the progress they are making.</p>
                        <p>Our representational efforts must increasingly involve younger Iranians
                            whom we have noted as the "comers" in the Government and private sector.
                            We must de-emphasize entertaining the same small select circle of
                            Iranians who, although influential and powerful, do not reflect the
                            pressures for change presently being felt in Iran. The younger officers
                            must make greater efforts to visit universities and colleges and discuss
                            with the students America's role as a partner in Iran's development.</p>
                        <p>These suggested steps, both in style and substance, are not the whole
                            answer in themselves. We believe, however, that they will assist in
                            convincing Iranian youth as it grows toward leadership, that America,
                            like themselves, may pragmatically accept the existing nature of the
                            governments with which it must deal, but that it is also aware of, and
                            has an appreciation for, the forces for change which will transform the
                            Iranian state and government as it emerges into the last third of the
                            twentieth century.</p>

                            the 14 February Oil Settlement With The Persian Gulf States</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                        <p>On 14 February 1971 the six Persian Gulf members of the Organization of
                            Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>) —
                            Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar — reached a
                            highly favorable settlement with the region's private oil producers.
                            Acting in concert, these countries, which produce nearly all Persian
                            Gulf output, won tax and price concessions that will greatly increase
                            their oil revenues over the next five years.</p>
                        <p>These increased revenues come at a time when some Persian Gulf
                            governments face balance-of- payments problems as well as limitations on
                            development and defense spending. In other cases the increased revenues
                            will merely add to already large coffers, both public and private. This
                            memorandum estimates the level of increased revenue generated by the
                            February 1971 agreement and analyzes briefly the impact that the
                            increases will have on the individual countries.</p>
                        <p>Note: This memorandum was prepared by the Office of Economic Research and
                            coordinated within the Directorate of Intelligence.</p>

                        <p>8. Iran, unlike Saudi Arabia, has not had large foreign exchange reserves
                            in recent years, and its rapid economic and military expansion has led
                            to considerable deficit financing and balance- of-payments problems. At
                            the end of 1970, Iran's holdings of gold and foreign exchange had fallen
                            to a six year low (about $210 million), or less than two months'
                            imports. The revenue increases generated by the February oil settlement
                            afford Tehran an opportunity to push economic development further or to
                            pay off burdensome short and long-term debts. It seems likely that the
                            Shah will choose expansion and will spend to the limit of Iran's
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>9. On 24 February — ten days after the agreement — the Shah proposed a
                            budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971-72 (21 March 1971 to
                            20 March 1972) that not only will consume all the increased oil revenues
                            but also will require substantial deficit financing. The new budget will
                            include a $1.3 billion deficit, or one-fifth of the expenditures, which
                            will be covered by drawdowns on foreign loans of about $800 million and
                            domestic borrowing of approximately $500 million. Both forms of
                            borrowing will exacerbate an already difficult financial situation. The
                            increased recourse to foreign loans, some short-term, will increase the
                            debt service ratio, which already is more than 15% of foreign exchange
                            earnings and requires foreign payments in excess of $150 million
                            annually. By expanding its domestic borrowing, the government is using
                            up credit normally available for private investment. Thus Iran will
                            continue to walk a narrow financial tight rope.</p>

                        <p>1. Since receipt Tehran's <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss> and
                            comments by other addressees we have considered carefully, including
                            review with Under Secretary, what useful role <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might play in both Gulf islands and Federation
                            problems. Earlier we had sought British views (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 32518) on how Iran's adamant
                            position on islands might be used positively to support efforts to
                            establish Federation. British have now informed us they have given our
                            question considerable thought and have proposed that Sir WILLIAM LUCE
                            discuss <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> thinking with ARP Country
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_MRW4">Murphy</persName> who will be in

                        <p>2. Our own review has produced following judgments: Despite seeming
                            intractability both islands and federation problems <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should not sit back and let Gulf
                            situation drift ominously into 1972 if there are places and ways in
                            which US influence can be brought effectively to bear. In view
                            restricted range our relationships with Gulf shaykhs and far more
                            influential British relationship with them we see no point in direct US
                            approach to Gulf rulers on islands problems and no need to increase our
                            encouragement to them re Federation beyond general statements which
                            ConGen Dhahran has made under instructions in past. While we should
                            continue to encourage constructive role by both Saudis and Kuwaitis in
                            Gulf, we feel specific approach to them at this time in support of
                            Federation will not be effective although we do not preclude such
                            approaches at later stage. Thus, we conclude that any US initiatives to
                            solve these problems must be taken primarily with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Iran. After exploring in London how British see
                            remaining options, we expect to find it necessary to make strong pitch
                            that they increase pressure on shaykhs re Federation and islands or <pb n="3" xml:id="d118-03" facs="d118-03"/>that they reach agreement
                            directly with Iran on islands. At same time we observe that Iran has
                            become increasingly inflexible over islands and federation issues which
                            we feel to be inconsistent with Iran's looming role as primary force for
                            area stability.</p>
                        <p>3. In London talks March 8 we intend to raise following questions with
                            British and would appreciate addressee comments:</p>
                        <p>a. Assuming British efforts to date, including March 1 policy statement,
                            have not borne fruitful results by end March, what further steps can
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> take to establish Federation and
                            compose islands dispute?</p>
                        <p>b. Is shaykhs' acquiescence needed or just helpful for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to reach arrangement on islands with
                            Shah? US support for such arrangement would concentrate on urging Shah
                            to go along.</p>
                        <p>c. Is there some sort of "objective" commission which could be expected
                            to reexamine historical claims and find in Iran's favor?</p>
                        <p>d. Are there ways in which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> can
                            usefully support future British initiatives?</p>
                        <p>e. What are prospects for either <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, US or
                            both making carefully <pb n="4" xml:id="d118-04" facs="d118-04"/>phrased
                            approach to Iran urging more active role in support of Federation? Point
                            we would try to sell Iran is that rather than opposing Federation as
                            tactic in getting islands Iran should in own interest be working for
                            Federation and could even use Federation question to further acceptable
                            solution of islands problem. For instance, Iran might be able to bring
                            pressure on Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah by helping create and support a
                            truncated Federation with condition that these two shaykhdoms be
                            excluded until islands dispute settled.</p>
                        <p>4. We intend push for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> response to
                            questions para 3, as perhaps amended by addressees' comments. If British
                            response appears to offer prospects that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can make substantial and timely progress on Gulf
                            problems, we would continue remain in background. If, however, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> response not promising, alternatives for
                            US initiative would appear to be either strong pressure on British (para

                        <p>SUMMARY: I TOOK AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> WITH ME TODAY TO CALL ON FOREIGN SECRETARY SIR
                            ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE SITUATION IN THE PERSIAN GULF.
                            SIR WILLIAM LUCE WAS ALSO PRESENT. AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> VOICED HIS CONCERN ABOUT
                            TRENDS IN THE GULF AND TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO BROACH, ON AN INFORMAL
                            BASIS, THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRODUCING AN IRANIAN CIVILIAN PRESENCE ON
                            THE DISPUTED ISLANDS OF ABU MUSA AND THE TUNBS BEFORE THE BRITISH LEAVE.
                            SIR ALEC PROMISED TO GIVE THE IDEA CAREFUL STUDY AND ON HIS OWN BEHALF
                            RAISED AN ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITY THAT AN HMG INVITATION FOR THE
                            IRANIANS TO TAKE OVER THE ISLANDS MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUNDS OF
                            ENSURING THE FUTURE SECURITY OF THE GULF. END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>SIR ALEC BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY REFERRING TO HIS RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF
                            BRITISH GULF POLICY TO THE COMMONS (LONDON 1906). THE GOVERNMENT, SIR
                            ALEC SAID, HAD A CHOICE OF STAYING ON, OR OF MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR NEW
                            AGREEMENTS WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> TO
                            PLAY A ROLE IN FUTURE GULF STABILITY WITH THE CONSENT AND COOPERATION OF
                            THE SHEIKHDOMS. BRITISH POLICY IS BASED ON THE FORMATION OF A FEDERATION
                            TO <pb n="2" xml:id="d119-02" facs="d119-02"/>WHICH THE TRUCIAL SCOUTS
                            COULD BE GIVEN AT THE TIME OF WITHDRAWAL. BRITAIN IS PREPARED TO
                            MAINTAIN PERMANENTLY SMALL CONTINGENTS OF NAVY AND ARMY. THE GENERAL
                            THRUST OF BRITISH POLICY IS TO PRE-EMPT ANY POSSIBLE SOVIET
                            INTERVENTION. A FEDERATION IS THE BEST WAY. HOWEVER, IF NO FEDERATION
                            CAN BE FORMED, THE <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> MUST MAKE DEALS
                            WITH THE SEPARATE LARGER STATES. THE SITUATION NOW IS THAT THE ISLANDS
                            DISPUTE WITH IRAN INTERFERES. THE TWO SMALL SHEIKHDOMS OF SHARJA AND
                            RAS-AL-KHAIMAH ARE INTIMIDATED BY THEIR FEAR OF ARAB REACTION TO THEIR
                            GIVING UP THE ISLANDS TO IRAN. THE SHAH HAS "PUT HIS FOOT INTO IT" BY
                            HIS PUBLIC INSISTENCE THAT HE MUST HAVE SOVEREIGNTY.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> AGREED BRITISH
                            GOVERNMENT HAD NO REAL CHOICE EXCEPT TO WITHDRAW. HE ALSO AGREED FULLY
                            THAT THE SOVIETS AND THEIR RADICAL ARAB PROTEGES POSE A GENUINE THREAT.
                            IT USEFUL TO RECALL THAT RUSSIAN ASPIRATIONS IN THE GULF GO BACK TO
                                <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">PETER</persName> THE GREAT AND THAT IN
                            1946 SOVIETS WERE FRUSTRATED IN THEIR EFFORT TO CUT THROUGH THE
                            TURKISH-IRANIAN BARRIER TO THE ARABIAN PENINSULA AND THE GULF BY
                            DETACHING IRANIAN AZERBAIJAN. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO LEAP-FROG
                            TURKISH-IRANIAN BARRIER BY (A) PLACING RADICAL-ARAB STATES SUCH AS IRAQ,
                            SYRIA AND SOUTHERN YEMEN IN A POSITION OF INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON
                            MOSCOW AND (B) ENCOURAGING THESE RADICAL ARAB STATES TO SEEK TRIUMPH OF
                            "ARAB SOCIALISM" BY OVERTHROWING THE REGIMES IN THE MODERATE ARAB GULF
                            STATES THAT HAVE FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE WEST. IN EFFECT THEY SEEK
                            TO ELIMINATE WESTERN INFLUENCE IN ANY WAY THEY CAN.</p>
                        <p>HE SAID <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> HAS A FANTASTIC STAKE IN GULF
                            IN TERMS OF SECURITY, TRADE, COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, OIL, AND VERY LARGE
                            STERLING BALANCES IN LONDON HELD BY THE ARAB OIL PRODUCING STATES. NOW,
                            HOWEVER, THE SITUATION HAS REACHED A CRITICAL POINT WHICH SEEMS HINGE
                            LARGELY ON SOLUTION TO GULF ISLANDS PROBLEMS. THE <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> POSITION, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, IS THAT <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> CANNOT PERMIT AN IRANIAN MILITARY
                            PRESENCE ON THE ISLANDS BEFORE WITHDRAWAL WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE
                            RULERS. THE RULERS IN TURN SAY IF THEY AGREE TO SUCH AN IRANIAN PRESENCE
                            THEY WILL FIND THEIR VERY LIVES FORFEIT BEFORE ARAB DISPLEASURE.
                            THEREFORE, WE FACE AN IMPASSE. IF THIS IMPASSE CONTINUES TO THE END OF
                            THIS YEAR, <pb n="3" xml:id="d119-03" facs="d119-03"/>WESTERN INTERESTS
                            WILL FACE THE WORST OF ALL POSIBLE WORLDS.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> EXPRESSED HIS
                            PERSONAL VIEW THAT THE FEDERATION CANNOT BE FORMED AGAINST THE DIRECT
                            OPPOSITION OF THE SHAH. THIS LEADS TO FOLLOWING MAJOR CONCERNS: A) WHEN
                            BRITISH WITHDRAW THERE WILL BE NO FEDERATION AND IF THE INDIVIDUAL
                            SHEIKHDOMS CONTINUE SEPARATELY, THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO
                            SUBVERSION AND SUBVERSIVE OUTSIDE INFLUENCE; B) IF THIS YEAR PASSES WITH
                            NO SOLUTION, THE SHAH WILL THEN COMMIT BRUSQUE AND FORCEFULL SEIZURE OF
                            ISLANDS WHICH MAY WELL SPARK OTHER SEIZURES SUCH AS A SAUDI MOVE AGAINST
                            ABU DHABI OR AN IRAQI MOVE AGAINST KUWAIT; C) RADICAL ARABS AND SOVIETS
                            WILL EXPLOIT IRANIAN SEIZURE OF ISLANDS TO TRY TO MAKE FUTURE
                            COOPERATION BETWEEN IRAN, THE ONLY STRONG MODERATE GULF STATE, AND OTHER
                            MODERATE ARAB STATES DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND IF IRAN IS UNABLE
                            TO COOPERATE WITH MODERATE GULF STATES AND BOLSTER THEM, THEY RISK GOING
                            DOWN THE DRAIN. IN <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName>'S JUDGEMENT THERE
                            WILL BE A VACUUM IN GULF WHEN BRITISH WITHDRAW. ONLY QUESTION IS WHO
                            WILL FILL VACUUM AND WHEN. SINCE NEITHER US, BRITISH NOR ANY COMBINATION
                            OF WEST EUROPEAN STATES AND JAPAN IS IN POSITION TO DO SO, IF RADICAL
                            ARAB-SOVIET ATTEMPT TO FILL VACUUM IS TO BE FRUSTRATED, IT BE DONE ON
                            BASIS OF SHAH'S PROPOSAL, NAMELY, CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN IRAN AND
                            MODERATE ARAB STATES. IF SHAH TAKES ISLANDS, NOT ONLY WILL THERE BE NO
                            FEDERATION, NOT ONLY MAY THERE BE ADDITIONAL SEIZURES OF TERRITORY, BUT
                            MOSCOW AND RADICAL ARABS WILL EXPLOIT SITUATION AND MAKE FUTURE
                            COOPERATION BETWEEN IRAN AND THE ARAB MODERATES EXCEEDINGLY
                            DIFFICULT.</p>
                        <p>WE RECOGNIZE, <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> ADDED, THAT <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> HAS RACKED ITS BRAINS TO FIND A SOLUTION
                            TO THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF, <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> ASKED WHETHER, IF
                            BRITISH FELT THEY COULD NOT INTRODUCE IRANIAN MILITARY PRESENCE, THEY
                            COULD INTRODUCE CIVILIAN PRESENCE ON THE ISLANDS BEFORE WITHDRAWAL. HE
                            STRESSED HE DID NOT KNOW ALL THE PROBLEMS THIS MIGHT ENTAIL NOR HOW SHAH
                            WOULD REACT BUT FELT THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY LEAD SHAH TO SUPPORT
                            FEDERATION AND TO BE FORTHCOMING AND GENEROUS TO THE RULERS. IF <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> COULD ACCOMPLISH THIS, IT WOULD PUT
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> IN POSITION OF BEING FORTHCOMING
                            WITH SHAH. TRUE, RULERS MIGHT BE FORCED TO MAKE SOME NOISES, BUT THIS
                            MIGHT VERY WELL BE BEARABLE.</p>

                        <p>SIR ALEC SAID THAT THE BRITISH INDEED WERE RACKING THEIR BRAINS FOR
                            SOLUTION. PROBLEM WAS MADE MUCH TOUGHER BECAUSE SHAH WOULD NOT AGREE TO
                            FUZZ SOVEREIGHTY ISSUE. INTRODUCTION OF A CIVILIAN IRANIAN PRESENCE
                            MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT EASIER BUT ESSENTIALLY IT SEEME TO BE SUBJECT TO SAME
                            OBJECTIONS AS MILITARY PRESENCE. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> ASKED IF <pb n="5" xml:id="d119-05" facs="d119-05"/>IT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE

                        <p>SIR ALEC SAID HE HAD RECENTLY TOYED WITH POSSIBILITY OF SHAH HOLDING

                            MADE DIFFICULT BY THE SHAH'S INSISTENCE ON SOVEREIGNTY. REGARDING

                            ISSUE WITH ARABS THAT ALL ARE WATCHING AND INTRODUCTION OF CIVILIAN
                            PRESENCE WOULD RAISE SOME BASIC PROBLEMS AS MILITARY PRESENCE. SIR ALEC
                            ADDED THAT HIS FEAR IS THAT INTRODUCTION OF IRANIAN CIVILIANS WOULD BE
                            EXPLOITED BY THE ARABS. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> AGREED THAT RADICAL
                            ARABS WOULD CERTAINLY TRY TO EXPLOIT SUCH A SOLUTION. HOWEVER, IMPORTANT
                            THING, HE THOUGHT, WAS TO AIM AT IRANIAN-MODERATE ARAB COOPERATION, FOR
                            FUTURE GULF SECURITY. THIS IS WHAT SOVIETS FEAR MOST AS IS CLEAR FROM
                            THEIR BROADCAST PROPAGANDA AND THAT OF RADICAL ARABS BEAMED ON GULF.
                            CERTAINLY, TO MAKE IRAN-GULF ARAB COOPERATION POSSIBLE WILL COST BRITISH
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="d119-06" facs="d119-06"/>SOMETHING BUT ALTERNATIVE
                            OF NO FEDERATION AND A CHAOTIC SITUATION COULD COST EVEN MORE.</p>
                        <p> LUCE INTERJECTED THAT <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> DOES NOT ACCEPT
                            THAT SHAH NECESSARILY CAN PREVENT THE FORMATION OF A FEDERATION. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> SAID THIS WAS OF
                            COURSE MATTER OF JUDGEMENT. IF ALL THE NINE STATES STRONGLY DESIRED A
                            FEDERATION, THIS COULD BE SO. HOWEVER, GIVEN FAINT-HEARTED SUPPORT OF
                            FEDERATION IDEA IN SHEIKDOMS SHAH'S OPPOSITION COULD BE DETERMINING
                            FACTOR.</p>
                        <p>SIR ALEC NOTED THAT IF CIVILIANS FROM ANY OTHER COUNTRY WERE TO BE
                            INTRODUCED ON THE ISLANDS, HMG WOULD BE BOUND TO PUSH THEM OFF: WHY
                            WOULD THIS NOT ALSO BE TRUE OF IRANIAN CIVILIANS? SIR WILLIAM ADDED THAT
                            THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY SO SINCE THE <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> HAD MADE A POINT WITHIN RECENT YEARS OF REMOVING IRANIAN
                            BUOYS FROM THE VICINITY OF THE ISLANDS. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> STRESSED THAT
                            SITUATION HAS DRASTICALLY CHANGED SINCE BRITISH WITHDRAWAL ANNOUNCED.
                            NOW WE KNOW THAT SHAH WILL SEIZE ISLANDS.</p>
                        <p>SIR ALEC ASKED HOW FAR WOULD <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> OFFEND
                            MODERATE ARABS IF IT WERE TO CONNIVE IN AN IRANIAN CIVILIAN PRESENCE.
                                <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> RECALLED THAT SHAH
                            HAD TOLD HIM PERSONALLY AND PRIVATELY THAT HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT
                            KING FEISAL WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM WHEN IRAN OCCUPIES ISLANDS.
                            FURTHERMORE, SHAH FEELS THAT BAHRAIN, ABU DHABI AND DUBAI WILL LOOK THE
                            OTHER WAY. HOWEVER, HE ALSO FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT IF THERE IS A
                            FEDERATION, ANY MEMBER STATE COULD RAISE A CRY OPPOSING IRAN'S TAKING
                            ISLANDS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF FEDERATION WOULD FEEL BOUND TO GO ALONG.
                            THIS IS WHY SHAH ADAMANTLY OPPOSES FEDERATION UNTIL THERE IS IRANIAN
                            PRESENCE ON ISLANDS.</p>
                        <p>THE FOREIGN SECRETARY WONDERED WHAT SORT OF FIGURE <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> WOULD CUT WITH RULERS IF IT WERE TO SELL ARAB SOIL DOWN
                            THE RIVER. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> REJOINED THAT THERE
                            IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE CHANCE THAT WHILE THEY WILL COMPLAIN THEY WILL
                            NOT RAISE MAJOR OUTCRY. SOME SHEIKHDOMS COUNT ON IRANIAN HELP IN TIME OF
                            NEED. FURTHERMORE, THE FACT IS THAT ISLANDS ARE THEMSELVES TINY AND HAVE
                            LITTLE POPULATION. IF A PACKAGE COULD BE PUT TOGETHER, IT SEEMED
                            POSSIBLE SHEIKHDOMS COULD STOMACH IT WITHOUT PUBLICLY AGREEING TO
                            IT.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d119-07" facs="d119-07"/>
                        <p>AT THIS POINT, SIR ALEC RAISED AN ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITY. IF AN IRANIAN
                            CIVILIAN PRESENCE WERE TO BE INTRODUCED WOULD NOT IT BE BETTER TO CEDE
                            ISLANDS TO IRANIANS OPENLY, JUSTIFYING IT ON BASIS THAT IT WAS REQUIRED
                            FOR THE SAKE OF THE FUTURE STABILITY AND SECURITY OF GULF. A FEDERATION
                            MIGHT SOME DAY BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TOWARD GULF SECURITY, BUT
                            THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL EVER BE FORMED. THEREFORE, WHY SHOULD
                            NOT <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> STATE THAT, IN THE INTERESTS OF
                            GULF SECURITY, IRAN SHOULD HAVE THE ISLANDS.</p>
                        <p>WE ALL AGREED THAT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING AND CHALLENGING POSSIBILITY.
                                <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> POINTED OUT THAT NOT
                            ONLY MUST WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING SOVIET PRESENCE IN GULF AND
                            SOVIET AID IN CONSTRUCTING PORT FACILITIES AT UMM QASR IN IRAQ, BUT ALSO
                            BY CHICOM ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN KUWAIT. FURTHERMORE, WE
                            MUST ALSO REMEMBER RELATIONSHIP OF GULF SITUATION TO OUR SECURITY
                            CONCERNS IN INDIAN OCEAN.</p>
                        <p>SIR ALEC ASKED IF SHAH WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO A REGIONAL DEFENSE
                            ARRANGEMENT IF HE OBTAINED THE ISLANDS. A BRITISH HAND-OVER TO THE
                            IRANIANS COULD CONCEIVABLY BE JUSTIFIED ON BASIS OF REGIONAL DEFENSE
                            NEEDS. SIR WILLIAM OBJECTED THAT SUCH A BRITISH HAND-OVER WOULD ENSURE
                            THAT NONE OF THE ARABS WOULD AGREE TO A REGIONAL ARRANGEMENT. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName> RECALLED THAT SHAH,
                            IN RABAT IN 1969, HAD PUT TO KING <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> THE IDEA OF COOPERATIVE REGIONAL SECURITY
                            ARRANGEMENTS AND HAD ASSURED <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> THAT HE WOULD AGREE TO ANY TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT
                            WHICH WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE SAUDIS WHETHER IT BE FORMAL SECURITY
                            TREATY OF TACIT AND INFORMAL UNDERSTANDING THAT IRAN WOULD COME TO AID
                            OF GULF STATES IF REQUESTED. SHAH HAD SUGGESTED INFORMAL ARRANGEMENTS
                            SINCE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR MODERATE ARABS TO SIGN A
                            FORMAL SECURITY TREATY AS RADICAL ARABS WOULD ACCUSE THEM OF SPLITTING
                            ARAB WORLD.</p>
                        <p>IN CONCLUSION, SIR ALEC SAID HE WISHED TO THINK OVER "CIVILIANIZATION"
                            IDEA BROACHED BY <gloss target="#t_Amb1">AMB</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName>. IN BRITISH VIEW,
                            SHAH IS FOOLISH TO OPPOSE THE FEDERATION NOW, BUT THE FACT IS HE DOES,
                            AND THE ISLANDS PROBLEM THEREFORE IS THE KEY. THE IDEA OF INTRODUCING
                            CIVILIANS IS A NEW ONE <pb n="8" xml:id="d119-08" facs="d119-08"/>AND
                            THE FOREIGN SECRETARY WOULD PERSONALLY GIVE IT VERY SERIOUS THOUGHT. HE

                        </list>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries with the Under Secretary, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> remarked that he had
                            recently seen the Shah at San Moritz and had been requested by him to
                            draw our attention to the important role Iran plays in its part of the
                            world. When one looks at the map extending from Burma to Greece, one
                            sees nothing but instability and uncertainty with the sole exception of
                            Iran. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> noted
                            that in order for Iran to protect itself and help those around it, it
                            must be militarily strong, and it looked to the United States for
                            assistance in this respect. He said that he hoped the Export-Import Bank
                            would be able to provide more credit for Iran to buy military equipment
                            in the United States, and also that we would not put limits on the
                            military equipment Iran wanted to obtain. The Under Secretary noted that
                            there were several factors which influence the amount of assistance we
                            could provide to friendly countries. Important among these was the
                            amount of appropriations the Congress was willing to legislate and the
                            volume of competing requests for these resources. The Under Secretary
                            noted we were not always able to persuade the Congress to agree with our
                            view of the needs. This was true not only of requirements to help our
                            friends but also requirements to meet our own security and civilian
                            needs. Nevertheless, we have helped Iran in the past, we are greatly
                            impressed with the progress it has made, and we hope to be able to help
                            it in the future.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d120-02" facs="d120-02"/>
                        <p>The Under Secretary recalled that during his brief visit to Tehran in
                            January, he had heard of a study the Iranian Government was undertaking
                            to examine its military requirements and the financial, manpower,
                            training, and maintenance implications of these requirements on
                            available resources and competing civilian needs. He thought this was a
                            most interesting and useful undertaking and looked forward to hearing
                            more about it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> said that in
                            connection with improving Iran's military posture, he hoped that the
                            United States could help to train additional Iranian pilots for C-130s
                            and helicopters. The Under Secretary noted that we had been helpful to
                            Iran in this respect in the past (which the Ambassador gratefully
                            acknowledged), and indicated that we would be prepared to give
                            sympathetic consideration to additional requests. He cautioned however
                            that we would of course know better how fully responsive we could be
                            once the Iranian Government had given us a specific idea of what it
                            believed its requirements to be.</p>
                        <p>Harking back to instability in the area and the constructive role Iran
                            could play in the future, the Under Secretary referred to the problem of
                            the Tunbs and Abu Musa and the Federation of Trucial States. He said
                            that he hoped Iran would give further thought to its stated position
                            about opposing the Federation if the Sheikhs would not agree to Iran's
                            position on the Islands. He said we felt that it would be in Iran's
                            interests and the interests of its neighbors if some sort of federation
                            could be formed before the British left, although noting that such a
                            federation would more likely involve seven or fewer states rather than
                            the nine that had been envisaged up until now. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> said that Iran felt very deeply
                            about the need to have these Islands. The Under Secretary replied that
                            he understood that Iran felt it may have to seize these Islands by force
                            but in whatever way the Islands problem was settled, he hoped that Iran
                            could consider its attitude toward the Federation a separate issue.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> said he
                            understood.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> then turned to
                            the question of an open letter to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that had been published in the Washington Post on
                            March 15. He commented that the alleged author of the letter, which was
                            highly derogatory to the Shah, the Royal Family, and Iran, was
                            non-existent as was the so-called "Free Iran" organization. He said <pb n="3" xml:id="d120-03" facs="d120-03"/>that he had talked to the
                            President of the Washington Post, Mr. Ignatius, asking why this letter
                            had not carried the usual notice that it was a paid advertisement.
                            Further he had questioned the Washington Post's willingness to print a
                            letter from a non-existent person and a nonexistent organization. He
                            said Mr. Ignatius had told him that the absence of a notice that the
                            letter was a paid advertisement was an inadvertent oversight and that
                            the Post does not normally print letters from non-existent
                            organizations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>
                            left the impression that he was not entirely satisfied with Mr. Ignatius
                            explanation. The Under Secretary commented that the appearance of this
                            letter under the circumstances described suggested poor practice on the
                            part of a publication of reputed high standards, but went on to note
                            that under our system of freedom of the press all sorts of things
                            including attacks on our own Government appeared in the newspapers. He
                            was certain that the Ambassador understood that under our system nothing
                            much could be done about it except to try to insure that the press and
                            the public were informed of all the facts.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The main reason for your seeing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MAC ARTHUR</persName> is to get his feel for how you might manage a
                            visit to Iran later this year. There will be a brief photo opportunity
                            at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that the Shah has invited you to attend the anniversary
                            celebration of 2500 years of Persian monarchy at Persepolis October
                            13-15 and to pay a state visit to Iran either immediately before or
                            immediately after those ceremonies. When the invitation initially came
                            last summer, you replied that you would like in principle to accept but
                            would have to wait before committing yourself. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MAC ARTHUR</persName>'s return to Iran would
                            provide an occasion for sending some informal word to the Shah of your
                            tentative plans.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MAC ARTHUR</persName> feels you
                            should avoid the celebrations themselves. Some 40 heads of state are now
                            said to be planning to attend. Security and logistics would be major
                            problems. The Ambassador, however, very much wants you to come to Iran.
                            He feels it would be manageable for you to pay a visit in late September
                            or very early October.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MAC ARTHUR</persName> will also
                            probably wish to mention to you the evolving situation in the Persian
                            Gulf. The Iranians may seize three small islands in the mouth of the
                            Persian Gulf if the British fail to make arrangements satisfactory to
                            Iran in permitting Iran to station defense forces there after British
                            departure.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points</p>
                        <p>1. What is the Ambassador's advice on the best way to handle a visit to
                            Iran? [Anything you can tell the Ambassador about your travel plans
                            would be worth asking the Ambassador to pass to the Shah when he returns
                            to Iran just to indicate that the Shah's invitation remains on your
                            mind.]</p>
                        <p>2. Would the Ambassador care to say a word or two about the situation
                            which he sees evolving in the Persian Gulf?</p>

                            much better than I do, when the British pull out of the Gulf.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: That vacuum is going
                            to be filled. Iran is going to have to play the major part in doing
                            it.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Are they capable of it? He
                            talks about that, and I hope now, and I know he talked about [unclear].
                            And as you know, I'm, as I'm sure you are, I'm stronger than a
                            horseradish for him. But then I raised it with our staff here-Defense
                            they sort of stare at it [unclear]- but they say, "Well the Shah just
                            hasn't got the stuff,” is that right, Al? Isn't that what we find? They
                            don't think-they just don't think he's got the stroke to do it.</p>

                            said, "They really didn't understand this Middle East thing at all, with
                            all its complexities.” And from your many talks with him he's convinced
                            that, that, that you are. Now if you-when you go there, we'll have some
                            suggestions about things-</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Would be marvelous.
                            It's awfully important.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, you put in the, you
                            put it in the wheels here. Let me suggest this, Doug, do not at this
                            moment, do not at this moment put it in the wheels at State.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: I won't, sir.</p>

                            I mean I'll tell Bill Rogers-</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Yeah.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Sometime privately. I'll
                            just say "Now look, if you hear about this it's because I talked to the
                            Shah personally.” But if I put it in the wheels at State then, of
                            course, all the desk officers over there'll say, "Well, why doesn't he
                            do this and that beforehand" -</p>

                            we want to do-what I want you [<persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>] to do is you talk to Haldeman-</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: -about my own schedule
                            here. Tell him I'd like to see what we can work out. And let's just
                            block off a little time in September. I need it to fit in perfectly.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: The only thing I'll
                            say at State is, what I've said before-</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: -that I know that
                            you want to go-</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: -when you can. But
                            it isn't clear at this time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I think you should report
                            to State, obviously, that we discussed the matter. That I said that
                            I-that I had told the Shah that I was going to come, that I do intend
                            to, but right now the-the fall looks uncertain. I just can't make a
                            commitment. But that I have it under consideration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: How's that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: That's fine.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: That's perfect.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: But you tell the Shah that
                            the, the deal is, that the decision has been made but the timing is the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Fair enough?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Yeah, that's fine.
                            That'll do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And then on this-what
                            about this? Does he need more money? No, I'm sorry. I don't mean more
                            money. Does he need-what he's saying, he says "Look, we're- if we can
                            have more arms,” in effect, as I understood it, then they can play, fill
                            that-the role out there, you know, in the whole darn Gulf area. Well,
                            now maybe he's thinking too big considering-</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Well, he may be
                            thinking a bit big. But I can't say that-what we're trying to do is to
                            get him to program. To get him-you know, instead of just sort of saying,
                            "I need this, I need that, I need the other thing.” Because if you say,
                            "you don't need this thing,” it's through the roof.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Sure.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: But what we haven't
                            said is, to develop your Five-Year Plan, you need to have the basic
                            material, which is first, what are the items that you want? Cost. Costs.
                            The infrastructure that's needed to support them. And then very
                            important, the personnel that you have and will need to marry them and
                            cost the whole thing. And then this serves the basis for identifying
                            priorities and developing a five-year program. This is what we're
                            working on with him. And I've talked to Henry Kearns, at EX-IM here,
                            they've got-they need some credit. Henry's handling it extremely well, I
                            think. And I think it's going to be a mix of some gap-private
                            money-guaran - with the government guarantee as underwriting. So that it
                            does represent [unclear, a credited?] outflow from EX-IM. That's what
                            we're working on now. About 140 million for the, for this next fiscal
                            year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well I can, in all your
                            conversations, actually I feel very strongly about saying it, that you
                            and I have talked about this. That I want to help in every way we can,
                            and we naturally do have problems, and there are many demands and all
                            that. But that he comes very high on our thoughts and in our lists, and
                            that means a lot to him too.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: It means a lot to
                            him.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And, incidentally, it's
                            true.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: I know it's
                            true.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Whenever they send
                            anything in here that I can sign, I do. He should know that. We've had
                            to overrule State a couple of times on the damn things.
                            But-cause-they-you know, they have to. They've got to represent
                            everybody. But I like him, I like him, and I like the country. And some
                            of those other bastards out there I don't like, right?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Right. And, Mr.

                            sound, that is aggressive, and that above all regards us as just about
                            as its firmest friend. Elsewhere we're trying to shore up weaknesses and
                            it's a problem.</p>

                            presence there?" I said, "All right, now, Bob, let me tell you what.” I
                            said, "Thailand is a very different cup of tea from Vietnam. See, you
                            know, we've got a treaty with Thailand.” And I said, "In the event the
                            North Vietnamese start romping around in Thailand, they're going to call
                            that treaty up. And the United States has never broken a treaty. Now in
                            the event that we pull out of Thailand we'll damn well invite them-”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: "To come into Thailand.”
                            And I said, "Now what are you going to do? What do you want us to do? Do
                            you want us to lose-" I mean, in Vietnam where we have no treaty, and
                            where basically all we're doing is, frankly, trying to see through a
                            commitment that began, and we think for a good reason, and now we're
                            going to see it through in the right way. If, even there, it would shake
                            credibility for America in the world, goddamnit the first time that the
                            United States doesn't stand by a treaty? You've been to Japan, what the
                            Japanese think if we let the Thais go down the drain? Huh? Don't you
                            agree?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Oh, yes I do.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: We can't do it.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: No, no, you
                            can't.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And - so these - but these
                            guys don't think of that. They think - well. I said, "Now we've reduced
                            already 9,000 in Thailand. And I don't think reducing any more is a very
                            good idea.” The Thais would go like - . Wouldn't they?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Oh, yeah. They're wavering

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, the point is that
                            we, getting back to your point, it is true, I guess you're right, Iran
                            is the only thing there. The Philippines is a can of worms, as you
                            know.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Yes.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Taiwan, [chuckle]
                            strangely enough, is a pretty strong little place, but it lives in
                            sufferance. Malaysia and Singapore are at each other's throats with Lee
                            Kwan Yew, the Socialist, being probably the ablest leader. The
                            Indonesians are beginning to come back but they're twenty years
                            away.</p>

                            Always will be. And you know the Burmese, they just chew that weed. That

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: And a strong Iran,
                            sir, in terms of the oil-a conviction which I share 200% is that we must
                            not see a basic balance between East and West altered radically. A
                            strong Iran-</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: You know, the
                            Soviets have been able, by-through their polarization of this
                            Arab-Israel conflict, they have been able to gain increasing influence
                            in these places, there's no question about it. But a strong Iran helps
                            counterbalance that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: But they're just one
                            friend there. And it-Iran is not of either world, really, in a sense, I
                            guess. But the point is, that by God if we can go with them, and we can
                            have them strong, and they're in the center of it, and a friend of the
                            United States, I couldn't agree more-it's something. 'Cause you look
                            around there, it just happens that, who else do we have except for
                            Europe? The Southern Mediterranean-it's all gone. Hassan will be here,
                            he's a nice fellow, but Morocco, Christ, they can't last. Morocco,
                            Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, the, the Sudan, naturally the UAR, all the
                            little miserable countries around-Jordan, and Lebanon, and the rest.
                            They're like-they go down like ten pins, just like that. That some of
                            them would like to be our friends, but central to every one of those
                            countries, even as far off as Morocco, is the fact that the United
                            States is aligned with Israel, and because we're aligned with Israel, we
                            are their enemy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: That's right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: That's what it is. Now
                            this doesn't mean that we let Israel go down the drain, because that
                            would play into the Soviet hands, too. But it does mean that right now
                            we're in a hell of a difficult spot, because, because our Israeli tie
                            makes us unpalatable to everybody in the Arab world, doesn't it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: It does. In varying

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: So he and I look at it
                            [unclear].</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: And he-the thing is
                            that if Saudi Arabia, which is terribly important-</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: And is rather
                            fragile, if it gets in trouble, the Shah is prepared-he's offered to
                            come to their assistance, and when the southern enemies hit [King]
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> in December of '69,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> turned first to the

                            things. And we encouraged this, because if they, if they can work
                            together, we think there's a reasonable chance.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: But, but I understand that

                            the Shah is wise enough to know that when you take a people that are

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: He does. He said to
                            me the other day before the oil talks, he said-he was talking about how
                            they need more revenue-he said, "Mr. Ambassador,” he said, "I need more
                            hospitals. I need more health services in my villages. I need more
                            workers' housing. I need more schools for my people.” He said, "I must

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: There is a-they don't grow

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Well, they-the main

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Dates and things of
                            that kind for export. But, but the things they have to do are wheat. And
                            they have set up-John Deere is putting a tractor factory in the South.
                            The Romanians put one in the North, which isn't functioning and Ford
                            told me that they are interested in taking that out and putting a better
                            job in. But you know, they produce Scott's tissues. They-It's-across the
                            board investment's pouring in from Western Europe because if you want to
                            invest in that kind of a country it's the only stable one that believes
                            in the free-enterprise system and that encourages it. The Shah said to
                            me, "I can't ask people to invest unless they can get a fair return on
                            their money, and for the-and unless they think that their investment is
                            secure. And when the radical Arabs ask him to join at, in his oil
                            negotiations and insist on forcing the investors to 25% of the profits,
                            the Shah said "No. What, what the companies do with their profits is
                            their business, just like what I do with the oil money is our business.
                            If you want more investment, create the climate where investment wants
                            to come" and he's doing this. They're getting more and more
                            export-oriented. He hopes to set up an industrial business that will
                            serve Saudi Arabia, the, the Gulf area on the other side, and the region
                            around it. And they give high priority to projects-industrial
                            projects-plants-that will have a-20-25% will be export-oriented rather
                            than just domestic endeavors.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>: Well he's a

                            Belgium gave them a constitution, wonderful buildings, all the nice

                            that of all of Africa, of all those new countries, there is not one

                            [unclear] all this constitutional democracy and such.” What the hell

                            think, I-there just isn't any question, we've just got to be not
                            tolerant, not tolerant of violation of principles that we feel and
                            believe in very deeply. Not supporting the idea that there ought to be a
                            dictatorship to replace a democracy, or some sort of thing. Not saying a
                            dictatorship of the left is wrong, [brass band music playing] a
                            dictatorship of the right is right. But, having in mind one solemn fact,
                            that people in the world are in different stages of development and they
                            are different, and that each needs a system that fits its own. Japan,
                            for example, sure they have elections and all that sort of thing, but
                            you know damn well that a business oligarchy runs Japan.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador reviewed Iran's position and importance to the United
                            States. In his view Iran is the only strong, stable asset we possess
                            between Europe and Japan. Together with Turkey, it has the only
                            dependable air corridor for civilian and military traffic from east to
                            west and vice-versa. For other reasons our continued presence in that
                            country is of vital interest to the security of the United States. The
                            Ambassador recalled that the pre-World War II Molotov-Ribentrop
                            Agreements made clear the strategic importance of the Gulf to the Soviet
                            Union when it was stated "the region in the direction of the Persian
                            Gulf is the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union.” Rather than
                            achieving this goal through occupation as during and immediately after
                            World War II the Soviets are attempting to achieve their goals through
                            Syria, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula. The Soviets need for oil in
                            quantity after 1980 and the feudal aspect of governments of the area
                            make many of Iran's neighbors likely candidates for Soviet activities
                            especially when the British pull out at the end of this year. At this
                            reading, Iran appears as the only present possibility for stability,
                            strength and leadership after the British withdraw. If Iran's neighbors
                            on the other side of the Gulf are to resist the Sovet thrusts, the power
                            vacuum to be created by the British withdrawal must be filled and Iran
                            is the only country that is in a position to do so at this time.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d123-02" facs="d123-02"/>
                        <p>On the Islands question, the Ambassador recalled the Shah's public
                            statement that the Islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs belong to Iran and
                            that if an accommodation is not reached prior to the British withdrawal
                            the Iranians will take them thereafter. Precedents for enforcing claims
                            by force could lead to Saudi Arabian moves against Abu Dhabi, and an
                            Iraqi move against Kuwait. The British believe that when they pull out
                            at the end of 1971 they will be in a position to maintain their
                            influence as heretofore is in the Ambassador's view "nonsense.” Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJH1">Noyes</persName> seemed to share this
                            view. The Ambassador stated that the President has recognized the
                            relevance of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine
                            to Iran. There seems little doubt in the Ambassador's view that elements
                            for Saudi-Iranian cooperation in the area exist. However, a "pappa knows
                            best" attitude on our part would, insofar as Iran is concerned, be the
                            worst possible posture we could assume. The Iranians have the funds and
                            are quite prepared to buy what they feel they must have from French,
                            British, Italian or other sources if we refuse to sell these items to
                            them. The Ambassador made it clear that he was not suggesting that we
                            give Iran a blank check to buy whatever it wished in the United States,
                            but he wished to stress that in his view it might be preferable for us
                            to cede to a sale rather than to see the sale go to another supplier as
                            he believes that to the extent that Iran purchases from other suppliers
                            our ability to influence them in their decisions to purchase any
                            armaments and equipment is diminished. Other suppliers of arms in his
                            view have little or no desire to limit but on the contrary look to
                            boosting sales of arms to Iran. Thus, the Ambassador believes that by
                            working with the Shah we can endeavor to try and get the Shah to see and
                            understand the magnitude of his purchases and exercise his own
                            restraints. He is hopeful that the <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> Study will produce an understanding op the
                            part of the Iranians of the necessity for overall programming. Mr.
                            Pickering stated that <gloss target="#t_PMPRIMIN1">PM</gloss> was
                            terribly interested in this study.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> expressed a
                            hope that it would be possible to reduce the number of visits of
                            military personnel to Iran and mentioned the strain on the Embassy
                            resources as a result of these visits. The visitors to <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> during the second six
                            months of 1970 were 268 visitors averaging 12 days per visit. During the
                            first quarter of 1971 there were 133 visitors averaging 7 days per
                            visit. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            stated that it's planned to keep <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> at its present level and to continue to use the
                            Bahrain facilities.</p>
                        <p>As to the level of financing of Iranian military acquisitions through the
                                <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '72, the Ambassador felt that we should be a little
                            flexible in this regard and that we should get into a 50% funding
                            arrangement and a 50% credit guarantee arrangement with a total flow of
                            about $140 million. Mr. Chapman asked if the Ambassador was not
                            concerned with the impact of Iran's military purchases on the country
                            over the next five years to which the Ambassador replied that he was
                            not. He noted the significantly <pb n="3" xml:id="d123-03" facs="d123-03"/>increasing oil revenues (increase in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> '71 over <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> '70 estimated at $650 million) attributable not only to
                            increased unit income but as well conservatively estimated increases in
                            quantitative production. He noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> had just informed him that the debt-service ratio
                            had dropped to 14.5%. In the Ambassador's view, the credit situation
                            over the next several years would be tight but quite manageable and if
                            the copper project presently under consideration (Sar Chesmeh) worked
                            out the outlook on the economic front would be quite promising.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH1">Noyes</persName> said that he sensed some
                            concern with regards to the arms balance in the area, e.g., are the
                            American arms supplied to Israel and Iran drawing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into supplying more and more arms to
                            other Middle Eastern states. In Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s view the Soviets have already made gains
                            resulting from the polarization in the Arab-Israeli War and a strong
                            Iran is necessary to balance off this influence especially if the
                            Arabian Peninsula becomes radicalized. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> added that it was not a
                            question of giving Iran a blank check but rather of what can we do if
                            the Shah goes elsewhere? Are we not in a better position to limit the
                            arms race more effectively through our influence over the Shah than by
                            his exercising his freedom to purchase what he wishes from other
                            suppliers? In Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s view Iran's strengthening of its defenses
                            does not motivate the Soviets to increase arms supplies in other Middle
                            Eastern countries. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> stressed the points that the Shah is a free
                            and independent agent, possessed of the means to purchase arms and has
                            available to him sources of supply other than those from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pickering said that <gloss target="#t_PMPRIMIN1">PM</gloss> was
                            pleased that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had been able to get the Shah to look into the
                            question of whether its increased armaments was or could result in
                            sucking more armaments into the void. The Ambassador replied that he did
                            not know the answer to this question but he did know that in any event
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was not omnipotent in controling
                            it.</p>

                        <p>11th April, 1971.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>In pursuance to our recent correspondence regarding matters of foreign
                            policy in which we stressed the value and importance of continuing our
                            exchange of views on the latest developments in various quarters, I now
                            deem it advisable to acquaint you, Mr. President, with certain
                            information that has been brought to my attention in the course of my
                            conversation with Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Mahmud Riad of the
                            United Arab Republic.</p>
                        <p>During my talk with Mr. Riad, he intimated to me that when the U.A.R.
                            accepted the <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' Peace Plan,
                            she was under the impression that the United States, had already
                            obtained an assurance of Israel's acquiescence to the proposal for the
                            solution of the Middle East problem in accordance with the United
                            Nations Security Council Resolution of 22 November, 1967.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, as it is evident from Israel's reply to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, this country is not
                            ready to accept these proposals for peace and now the current opinion in
                            the U.A.R. is that the United States has not put sufficient pressure
                            upon Israel in this regard.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d124-02" facs="d124-02"/>
                        <p>Mr. Riad added that contrary to what has been said concerning his
                            country, the U.A.R. is not influenced by any foreign pressure and that
                            she is aware that the key to the solution of the Middle East problem
                            lies in the hands of the United States. He regrets that the United
                            States is not using all its efforts to solve this problem. He also said
                            that, despite the fact that the prospects for a peaceful solution are
                            rather dim and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>
                            is also pessimistic, the U.A.R. has not lost all hope that a peaceful
                            solution can still be found; and the U.A.R. Government shall not resort
                            to force in spite of the great pressure that is put upon her by public
                            opinion in that country. However, unless Israel correspondingly shows a
                            positive reaction, it is not possible for the U.A.R. to continue this
                            moderate attitude because the pressure exerted by the U.A.R. Armed
                            Forces and public opinion will eventually oblige the Government to
                            resort to force. If the present tacit ceasefire continues for an
                            unlimited period, it is feared that it will turn out to the benefit of
                            Israel and the detriment of the U.A.R. On the other hand, it is very
                            possible that contrary to the desire of both sides, the situation will
                            take a turn for the worse and lead to a resumption of widespread
                            hostilities and a bloody war. That is why notwithstanding the little
                            hope that exists, and while awaiting effective steps to be taken for the
                            establishment of peace, the U.A.R. will spare no efforts, on its own
                            part, in repressing the outbreak of hostilities. However, it is not
                            certain how long she will be able to withstand this situation.
                            Therefore, the U.A.R. has requested a number of <pb n="3" xml:id="d124-03" facs="d124-03"/>peace-loving nations to use their
                            influence with the United States Government in order to persuade her to
                            take effective steps for the establishment of a just and honourable
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Riad came, on behalf of the President and the Government of the
                            U.A.R., requesting me to use all my efforts to bring about a peaceful
                            solution to the Middle East crisis and to contact the United States
                            Government and I have promised him to do what I can in this respect.</p>
                        <p>From the talk I had with Mr. Riad I obtained the impression that the
                            peaceful attitude of the U.A.R. leaders is genuine and that the
                            continuation of the uncertain and critical situation prevailing at the
                            moment, is not to their advantage. They are anxious to re-establish
                            peace in order to direct their resources to constuctive work such as the
                            development of their economy. As I have said in my previous message, Mr.
                            President, I believe that the U.A.R. has adopted a positive attitude
                            towards the <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> proposals and
                            now that such a promising turn has taken place in their outlook, it is
                            appropriate for Israel to take positive steps and avail itself of this
                            opportunity. If Israel persists in taking a negative position the U.A.R.
                            will not be able to continue in its peaceful attitude and this would
                            undoubtedly lead to the outbreak of hostilities which may spread beyond
                            all control and create a most critical situation in this vital part of
                            the world.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d124-04" facs="d124-04"/>
                        <p>It is my belief that the U.A.R. should be encouraged in its stand and I
                            have explicitly told Mr. Riad that the solution of the problem must be
                            based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution of 22 November,
                            1967, and the Rogers' Peace Plan.</p>
                        <p>In expressing my opinion, I have told Mr. Riad that it is a source of
                            satisfaction to see, that in spite of the little hope existing at the
                            moment, the U.A.R. has not endeavoured to resume hostilities and that
                            she has decided to continue her moderate attitude. Should the U.A.R., in
                            the last resort, be obliged to use force to safeguard her legitimate
                            rights, I have advised Mr. Riad that in order to win worldwide public
                            opinion and possibly reach an eventual peaceful solution, the U.A.R.
                            should refrain from taking any action beyond opening fire from the other
                            side of the Suez Canal and should restrain herself from taking steps
                            which may lead to an all out war.</p>
                        <p>It is my firm belief that if the U.A.R. is to continue in this attitude
                            of moderation, Israel must also take a positive position in response. I
                            am confident, that you, Mr. President will do your utmost to exercise
                            your influence in this respect, for it is obvious that though in her
                            present negative stand Israel may be able to win a few battles, she is
                            not likely to win the war. Israel should therefore, avail itself of this
                            opportunity to achieve a just and honourable peace on the basis of the
                            United Nations Security Council Resolution of 22 November, 1967, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' Peace Plan, and the
                            continuation of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s <pb n="5" xml:id="d124-05" facs="d124-05"/>mission; and thus free the Middle East of all subversive forces. This
                            coupled with the willingness of the Four Permanent Members of the United
                            Nations Security Council to guarantee the integrity of Israel will
                            contribute to the creation of a favourable basis for the solution of the
                            Middle East conflict.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful to you, Mr. President, if you would kindly give this
                            matter your considered attention, and I will be very pleased to receive
                            your views in this regard.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. WHEN I SAW SHAH APRIL 14 HE SPOKE CRITICALLY OF LIBYAN OIL SETTLEMENT,
                            SAYING OIL COMPANIES ALWAYS MADE GREATER CONCESSIONS TO RADICAL
                            PRODUCING STATES THAN TO THEIR MODERATE PRODUCING STATE FRIENDS. HE SAID
                            HE WAS SENDING FINMIN <persName corresp="#p_AJ4">AMOUZEGAR</persName> TO
                            LONDON TO DISCUSS WITH OIL COMPANIES LIBYAN SETTLEMENT WITH VIEW TO
                            FINDING SOME WAY TO PARTIALLY BRIDGE GAP BETWEEN GULF SETTLEMENT AND
                            EXCESSIVE TERMS GIVEN LIBYA.</p>
                        <p>2. I REMINDED SHAH OF ASSURANCES HE HAD GIVEN US AND OIL COMPANIES THAT
                            TERMS OF GULF SETTLEMENT WOULD NOT BE CHANGED FOR FIVE YEARS EVEN IF
                            LIBYA RECEIVED MORE THAN GULF PRODUCERS. I ALSO OBSERVED THAT LARGE PART
                            OF DISPARITY BETWEEN GULF AND LIBYAN SETTLEMENT WAS RESULT OF LIBYA'S
                            FAVORED GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND LOW SULPHUR CONTENT OF ITS OIL. I
                            CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT IRANIAN PRODUCTION AND OFFTAKE SO FAR THIS YEAR
                            WAS RUNNING SUBSTANTIALLY AHEAD OF LAST YEAR AND THAT <pb n="2" xml:id="d125-02" facs="d125-02"/>THEREFORE I THOUGHT IRAN WAS DOING
                            EXTREMELY WELL.</p>
                        <p>3. SHAH REPLIED THAT HE WOULD HONOR HIS WORD RE FIVE YEAR ASSURANCES BUT
                            WOULD SEEK SOME WAY OUTSIDE TERMS OF TEHRAN SETTLEMENT TO HELP BRIDGE
                            DISPARITY BETWEEN GULF AND LIBYAN PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, OIL EXPORTED FROM
                            BASRA WAS OBLIGED TO PAY A "PORT TAX" AND HE HAD IN MIND POSSIBILITY OF
                            PORT TAX ON OIL LIFTED FROM KHARG ISLANUM I SAID SUCH A STEP WOULD BE
                            SERIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT TO OIL COMPANIES AND IRAN'S FRIENDS.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY<lb/> During the past week, sizeable student strikes erupted at
                            both Tehran and Arya Mehr Universities, resulting in police intervention
                            on both campuses involving same fairly rough tactics, a large number of
                            temporary arrests and even injury at the hands of the police of some
                            students and faculty members.</p>
                        <p>The trouble began at Tehran University where some students marched on
                            campus shouting slogans against the Shah, the White Revolution, the 25th
                            Centenary Celebrations and praising the murder of General FARSIOO.
                            Similar sentiments (except for praise of Farsioo's murder and
                            condemnation of the Shah) were expressed by students who demonstrated at
                            Arya Mehr. The quick despatch of police to the perimeters of Polytechnic
                            and National Universities seems to have prevented similar demonstrations
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Although none of the four universities has been closed, attendance at all
                            four is extremely low. One hundred-and-thirty of 180 full-time teachers
                            at Arya Mehr were so angered by police behavior that they submitted
                            their resignations and asked for same form of apology from the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>While this semester has been marked by increasingly frequent student
                            disturbances—and the appearance at Tehran University of a growing <pb n="2" xml:id="d126-02" facs="d126-02"/>danarchistic "violence for
                            the sake of violence" among the students—the events of the past week
                            have, in the opinion of most observers, exceeded the student-police
                            confrontation of 1968 in terms of both severity and numbers.</p>
                        <p>It is possible—though far from certain—the forcefulness of the
                            government's reaction to the most recent student demonstrations may
                            serve to prevent further such demonstrations this academic year. It has,
                            however, greatly widened the gap between the students, on the one side,
                            and the administration and the government on the other. Unless actions
                            are taken to reduce this gap—which would seem to require some
                            conciliatory gesture from the university administrations and the
                            government—it is difficult to see how the gap will not carry over into
                            the next academic year and provide fuel for further student
                            demonstrations then.</p>
                        <p>END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tehran University</p>
                        <p>Tehran University has been plagued by intermittent student strikes since
                            the beginning of the second semester. Several of the Colleges, including
                            Engineering, Science and Law have been closed for a considerable part of
                            the term, and student activism is increasing. The students are angered
                            that five of their colleagues, picked up by Savak after the December
                            disturbances on campus (when Dean Ganji of the Law Faculty was forced to
                            leave his position because of student opposition to reforms he attempted
                            to institute), have not yet been released. An additional three students
                            were also detained by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">Savak</gloss> and
                            charged with involvement in the Siah Kal incident (see Tehran's A-91 of
                            March 27, 1971), when government forces broke up a large band of
                            dissidents operating in the mountains south of the Caspian littoral. The
                            Engineering College has been in session only infrequently since the
                            beginning of the semester and went on strike again on April 27.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to establish a "dialogue" with the students, the university
                            administration arranged a meeting at which one of the Engineering
                            professors was to discuss the campus situation with the students. The
                            meeting was not successful, however, and was broken up when about 700
                            students began to march around the campus, shouting slogans against the
                            White Revolution, the 25th Centenary Celebrations and the Shah. They
                            also handed out leaflets praising the assassination of General FARSIOO
                            (Tehran's 1912, April 14, 1971) and supporting the Siah Kal dissidents.
                            The police were sent onto the campus armed with riot clubs, sub-machine
                            guns and gas masks. During the subsequent fighting, about 250 students
                            were arrested and an equal number injured, several of them seriously. A
                            number of teachers were also injured in the fighting.</p>
                        <p>The students demonstrated again on May 1, shouting, among Other things,
                            that "the College is closed and students are jailed.” The University
                            announced that the Engineering College would be closed for three days,
                            and the students have been warned that if they do not attend classes
                            once the <pb n="3" xml:id="d126-03" facs="d126-03"/>College opens, they
                            will lose all credit for this semester. The University has also said
                            that it will follow the same policy toward any other colleges that go on
                            strike.</p>
                        <p>As of May 8, a stalemate existed, with the police saying they will remain
                            on campus until the students return to classes. The campus has been
                            nearly deserted and students contend they will not return to classes
                            until the police vacate the university premises. The Government's
                            position is especially difficult since it officially justifies the
                            police presence on campus as allowing "the vast majority of students" to
                            attend classes free from "intimidation.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arya Mehr University</p>
                        <p>Arya Mehr has always been the calmest of the universities in Tehran.
                            Chancellor Reza Amin has established cordial relationships with his
                            faculty and student body, so Arya Mehr has usually been free from
                            student demonstrations such as occur at Tehran University. The recent
                            demonstrations and police actions on the Arya Mehr campus are all the
                            more noteworthy considering the school's history of having generally
                            constructive and positive faculty-administration-student
                            relationships.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday, May 1, about 500 students at the University demonstrated on
                            campus, shouting slogans condemning the expenses being incurred for the
                            25th Centenary Celebrations. Riot police who had been stationed around
                            the campus entered the university and began beating some of the
                            demonstrators. About 400 students were arrested and a number injured.
                            Riot police entered classrooms and arrested students en masse. The
                            police also beat a number of faculty members, and one was hospitalized
                            with two broken fingers, a broken arm and a broken skull.</p>
                        <p>The faculty became angered at the rough police tactics noting that the
                            police entered the campus without being invited by the administration.
                            Chancellor Reza Amin—who has the support of his faculty and close
                            relations with the students—has not allowed the police onto the campus
                            during former demonstrations, realizing that their presence could
                            destroy his close rapport with the students. During the May 1
                            demonstrations, the police entered the campus over Amin's
                            objections,</p>
                        <p>One hundred-and-thirty of the 180 full-time teachers and professors
                            submitted a joint resignation to the university and stated they would
                            not return to work until a number of their demands are met, the first of
                            which was the dismissal of General <persName corresp="#p_NNGN1">Nassiri</persName>, Chief of <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">Savak</gloss>. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> met with Chancellor Amin on the evening of May 4
                            and told him that the teachers would not be allowed to resign. Amin then
                            requested, and was granted, an audience with the Shah on the evening of
                            May 5. Several representatives of the faculty also attended the audience
                            at which time Amin described the faculty's position and the reasons for
                            the resignations. The Shah finally agreed to order the Prime Minister to
                            appoint an investigative committee to study the faculty's charges of
                            police brutality during <pb n="4" xml:id="d126-04" facs="d126-04"/>the
                            demonstrations. The Committee began its work on May 6, and the Faculty
                            members have agreed to withhold their resignations until the committee
                            releases its findings and recommendations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">National and Polytechnic Universities</p>
                        <p>Both National and Polytechnic Universities are also being patrolled by
                            riot police with batons and gas masks. There have not yet been
                            demonstrations on either campus and the police have remained off the
                            grounds, but it is obvious the government is highly concerned that
                            sympathy demonstrations may be held at both universities. Student
                            attendance is very low at both schools and many classes are not
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>Although student strikes at the universities in Tehran occur every
                            semester, there have been a number of disturbing trends this academic
                            year which indicate that student-university confrontations are
                            increasing and posing increasingly bothersome problems for the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>a) Increasing Number - During previous years, most Iranian universities
                            were plagued by semi-annual strikes before each examination period when
                            students protested examination schedules. However, during the past
                            semester at Tehran University, the students have been out of classes for
                            much of the term in several faculties. For example, in the Engineering
                            Faculty they protested the detention of five students after the December
                            disturbances and did not attend classes before the Now Ruz vacation
                            (from mid-March to early April). After returning to classes for a few
                            weeks, they are out on strike once again.</p>
                        <p>b) Increasing Radicalism and Violence - Former strikes at Iranian
                            universities were usually centered around specific student demands,
                            ranging from lower tuition fees to longer examination schedules—although
                            the specific demands may often have been merely indicative of more
                            substantial grievances about the educational and political structure in
                            Iran. During this past academic year, however, a growing number of
                            students are advocating radicalism for its own sake. Some students state
                            they should emulate their Turkish colleagues. Also, since a university
                            administrator was attacked by students in February and hospitalized with
                            a concussion, several university administrators are afraid to walk on
                            campus. This trend toward greater radicalism and violence has been
                            evident throughout the semester.</p>
                        <p>c) More Radical Slogans - The recent disturbances at the Engineering
                            College were marked by anti-Shah and anti-White Revolution slogans.
                            Although during previous strikes, such slogans were painted on
                            university walls and printed in leaflets, this is the first time in
                            seven years they have been voiced so loudly during a student
                            demonstration. This evidence of increasing boldness and dissatisfaction
                            on the part of the students has <pb n="5" xml:id="d126-05" facs="d126-05"/>considerably unsettled university and security
                            officials. Reportedly, the main impetus to send police onto the Tehran
                            University campus was the slogans and leaflets praising the
                            assassination of General FARSIOO. One Iranian official told the Embassy
                            that student praise for the assassination of a high-ranking military
                            official was bound to provoke a strong reaction from the government.</p>
                        <p>d) Strong Official Reaction - Tehran University has reacted strongly and
                            quickly to the most recent demonstrations. The threat to withhold credit
                            for this semester if the Engineering students do not return to classes
                            is a serious one, and it may engender an equally strong reaction from
                            the students. Entry of the police on campus so soon after the most
                            recent demonstrations began and the rough police tactics are an
                            indication of the government's new "hard-line" and probably also reflect
                            its concern over the anti-Shah and FARSIOO slogans.</p>
                        <p>The Government's policy toward students has paralleled its policy toward
                            laborers. It acquiesces in what it considers to be minor demands which
                            do not threaten the stability of the educational or labor scene, but
                            takes firm action to stop any "illegal" student or labor activities
                            which may hamper the country's progress. The recent demonstrations on
                            the Tehran campuses represent another swing in the pendulum which
                            probably heralds the beginning of another era of tightening up on
                            student demonstrations. Reportedly, the Shah told the Editor of the
                            London Times on May 2 that he would not allow student "disruptionists"
                            to hinder the course of Iran's "educational revolution" and also implied
                            that he personally ordered the police onto the Tehran and Arya mehr
                            campuses.</p>
                        <p>A further indication of the new <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            "hard-line" toward students is reports, which the Embassy have received,
                            that the Shah has questioned Iranian news media coverage of
                            demonstrations by youth in Turkey, Western Europe and the United States.
                            He reportedly has stated that it is not useful to carry such stories as
                            they only provide a dangerous example for Iranian youth. Last month, the
                            national television station carried a fifteen minute film on student
                            demonstrations in Turkey. Reportedly, the station was told that such
                            coverage should not be repeated in the future.</p>
                        <p>These trends all indicate that the already wide gulf between the students
                            and the universities is becoming even larger and the government's
                            credibility with the students is very low. The US-educated Dean of the
                            Faculty of Political Science and Economies at National University told
                            an Embassy officer that he had never seen such antipathy toward the
                            government among students as had been generated by police actions
                            against the universities in the previous few days. He added that the
                            government will completely lose its credibility among students and large
                            numbers of the faculty if it tries to blame the recent disturbances on
                            "outside elements.”</p>
                        <p>The events of the past week cannot be fully understood without mentioning
                            the forces which have motivated the students. Undoubtedly, foreign
                            influences, both by example and direct involvement, played a central
                            role. <pb n="6" xml:id="d126-06" facs="d126-06"/>The example of student
                            activism and radicalism in the West and Turkey has given encouragement
                            to Iranian students who wish to rebel against the educational and social
                            system. Also, foreign powers, such as Iraq and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have attempted and will certainly
                            continue to attempt to exploit the students' dissatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>However, it would be remiss to overlook the fact that a large number of
                            Iranian university students feel they have serious, legitimate
                            grievances against the educational and political system in Iran and hope
                            that their demonstrations will encourage changes in the system, These
                            students are not swayed by outside influences and act from their own
                            personal sense of frustration and impatience at what they see as
                            inequities in the universities and the nation. It would be incomplete to
                            blame the demonstrations completely on outside influences and not
                            consider the students' personal and deeply-felt antipathies to many
                            aspects of their environment.</p>
                        <p>Unless the university administrations and the government take some action
                            to reduce the gap between themselves and the students and to increase
                            understanding on both sides, it is probable that the animosity felt by
                            the students will carry over into the next academic year and provide an
                            incentive for further student demonstrations.</p>

                        <p>1. THERE HAS BEEN IN LAST THREE MONTHS CONTINUATION AND DEFINITE
                            INTENSIFICATION OF SIGNS WE NOTED EARLIER (PARA 5 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) THAT EXTERNALLY DIRECTED AND
                            SUPPORTED SUBVERSIVE ELEMENTS ARE FOCUSING INCREASING ATTENTION UPON
                            IRAN DURING 1971. (WE UNDERSTAND FROM STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO NEW
                            TURKISH PRIME MINISTER THAT THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SIMILAR INTENSIFICATION
                            OF SUCH ACTIVITY IN TURKEY.)</p>
                        <p>2. TWO MOST DRAMATIC RECENT EXAMPLES IN IRAN OF COURSE, ARE: A. EFFORT TO
                            ESTABLISH PERMANENT GUERRILLA BASE (WITH EXTERNAL SUPPORT) IN LAHIJAN
                            REGION OF ALBORZ MOUNTAINS (TEHRAN A-91). ALTHOUGH ACTIONS BY IRANIAN
                            SECURITY FORCES IN JANUARY SEEM TO HAVE PREVENTED FORMATION OF SUCH BASE
                            AND RESULTED IN CAPTURE OF MOST OF "PARTISANS,” SOME STILL REMAIN AT
                            LARGE.</p>

                        <p>3. IN ADDITION TO THESE TWO MAJOR AND MUCH-PUBLICIZED SUBVERSIVE EFFORTS,
                            THERE HAS BEEN SERIES OF OTHER UNPUBLICIZED INCIDENTS:</p>
                        <p>A. THREATS IN LATE FEBRUARY, APPARENTLY INSPIRED BY RADICAL CONFEDERATION

                        </list>
                        <p>Since the time of the Egyptian's forthcoming reply to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> early this year, the
                            Shah has been active, both orally and by letters to you, in pressing his
                            beliefs that the Egyptians are entirely sincere in their quest for peace
                            while the Israelis have adopted a negative stance and should be pressed
                            to change their position.</p>
                        <p>In particular, the Shah met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Riad last
                            month and subsequently wrote you the letter at Tab C passing on his
                            views as a result of that meeting. According to the Shah, Riad made the
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>—When the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accepted the U.S. peace
                            proposal last summer, Cairo was under the impression that the U.S. "had
                            already obtained assurance of Israel's acquiescence to the proposal for
                            the solution of the Middle East problem in accordance with" the U.N.
                            resolution of November 1967. Riad noted that recent developments make it
                            clear that Israel "is not ready to accept" these proposals.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> believes the U.S. has not put
                            sufficient pressure on Israel.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has not lost all hope, despite
                            pessimism about prospects for a peaceful solution. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> government "shall not resort to force
                            in spite of the great pressure that is put upon her by public opinion in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. However, it is not possible for
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to continue indefinitely.
                            Allowing the present ceasefire to continue for an unlimited period would
                            turn out to the benefit of Israel.</p>
                        <p>—Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has requested a
                            number of nations to use their influence to persuade the U.S. to take
                            effective steps to achieve peace. [The Shah said he had promised to do
                            what he could in this respect.] [Iranian Foreign Minister ZAHEDI told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> he sent a
                            strong message to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> pointing out that Israel's negative stance was
                            causing Israel to lose its friends.]</p>
                        <p>The Shah concluded from his talk that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> leaders seem genuine in wanting peace and that the
                            continuation of the present uncertain situation <pb n="2" xml:id="d128-02" facs="d128-02"/>is not to their advantage. He
                            believes that they are anxious to reestablish peace in order to direct
                            their resources to constructive work such as development within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The lesson which the Shah draws from all of this is that Israel should
                            take advantage of the present opportunity. If Israel "persists in taking
                            a negative position,” the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will not
                            be able to continue its peaceful attitude and that could lead to the
                            outbreak of hostilities again. The Shah says he encouraged the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in maintaining the ceasefire. He asks
                            that "you, Mr. President, will do your utmost to exercise your influence
                            in this respect, for it is obvious that though in her present negative
                            stand Israel may be able to win a few battles, she is not likely to win
                            the war.”</p>
                        <p>While we were weighing the reply to this letter, in light of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> Mid-East travels, the
                            Shah's Foreign Minister paid an official visit to Cairo where he talked
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> and
                            Foreign Minister Riad. Hearing accounts of those meetings, the Shah
                            again wrote you [Tab B] noting that his Foreign Minister had extensive
                            discussions in Cairo and reaffirming the opinions he expressed in his
                            earlier letter to you. In short, in the second letter the Shah wrote
                            that:</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> "is genuinely seeking peace" and
                            "can be trusted and is in a position to conduct constructive
                            negotiations.”</p>
                        <p>—“The positive attitude adopted and the initiative taken by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> .…as well as the sound and reasonable
                            approach of the present regime, reaffirms my view that the United Arab
                            Republic is determined to follow a moderate course" towards peace.</p>
                        <p>—“That it is now for Israel to abandon her obstinate attitude or a good
                            opportunity for peace will be missed.</p>
                        <p>—“Every effort should be exerted to persuade Israel to refrain from
                            following this dangerous policy and respond constructively to the
                            genuine endeavors that are being made.”</p>
                        <p>The Shah explains that he has taken the liberty of writing you a second
                            letter on the subject because of the "gravity" of the circumstances and
                            "in keeping with" your mutual desire to exchange views.</p>
                        <p>At Tab A is a letter of reply for you to send to the Shah responding to
                            his broad viewpoint. It does the following:</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d128-03" facs="d128-03"/>
                        <p>—Thanks the Shah for sending both the accounts of and his views on the
                            Egyptian position.</p>
                        <p>—Assures the Shah that the U. S. remains committed to the search for a
                            peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>—Notes some encouragement from the developments of the past year,
                            especially the ceasefire.</p>
                        <p>—Shows understanding for <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>'s need for movement.</p>
                        <p>—States that we have told both Israel and Egypt that we would welcome any
                            arrangement that they agree upon for reopening the Suez Canal which
                            might reduce the dangers of renewed fighting and constitute a step
                            toward a final settlement.</p>
                        <p>—Expresses gratification that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            intended to do all it could for a negotiated settlement and to avoid
                            return to hostilities.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: That you sign the letter to the Shah at Tab A. The letter
                            has been cleared with <persName>Ray</persName> Price.</p>

                                discussed with <persName corresp="#p_ZH1">Zahedi</persName> the
                                Shah’s first letter, countering that although Washington was making

                                solution on Israel, which would only harden Tel Aviv’s stance. When
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> added that

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<lb/>WASHINGTON</p>
                        <p>Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your letters. I appreciated having a full account of
                            Foreign Minister <persName>Riad</persName>'s comments and your
                            observations on those, as well as on Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZH1">Zahedi</persName>'s discussions in Cairo. </p>
                        <p>As you know, I share your belief that a peaceful settlement of the
                            Arab-Israeli conflict must be sought in accordance with the Security
                            Council resolution of November 22, 1967. While I continue persuaded that
                            negotiating a peace agreement must be primarily the work of Israel and
                            the Arab states themselves, I recognize that the United States has an
                            important role to play in furthering this process. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> reaffirmed this during his stops
                            in the area.</p>
                        <p>Although there is much yet to be done, I have been encouraged by the
                            improvement that has taken place in the past year. The ceasefire has now
                            held for nine months, and this has helped bring about at least the
                            beginning of an evolution of public attitudes on both sides. There is a
                            degree of impatience, which is quite understandable. But the public
                            attitudes with which both sides must contend have been conditioned by
                            more than two decades of suspicion, and achievement of a peace that will
                            last will, of course, depend on a change of those public attitudes.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that the time factor cuts two ways. President <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> has frankly explained the
                            exigencies of the situation as he feels them, and we fully understand
                            that time is an important element: while time is needed to allow each
                            side to<pb n="2" xml:id="d129-02" facs="d129-02"/> adjust to the
                            compromises that are necessary to move toward a peace settlement, we
                            also are aware that the present situation continues to be fragile.</p>
                        <p> We are working with both sides within the context of the <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> mission, which we support
                            strongly. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>'
                            just-concluded trip to the Near East was in support of continued
                            negotiations under Ambassador Jarring's auspices and helped, we think,
                            to clarify the issues and narrow differences between the two sides. In
                            addition, Israel and Egypt have indicated their desire to work through
                            the United States Government in discussing the possibilities for an
                            interim Suez Canal agreement, and we are engaged in this role. Any
                            arrangement that may be agreed upon between the parties for reopening
                            the Suez Canal would not only reduce the dangers of renewed fighting,
                            but also constitute a step toward a final, overall settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Riad's statement to you that the United Arab Republic will do
                            everything possible to maintain its present policy of seeking a
                            negotiated peace settlement is reassuring. A return to warfare would be
                            a tragedy for all concerned. It would be bloody, immensely wasteful in
                            terms of national resources, and I cannot see that either side could
                            expect to achieve decisive results.</p>
                        <p>Your personal evaluations were most helpful. I hope you will continue to
                            be in touch with me directly on this matter whenever you feel it would
                            be useful. Certainly both of us share the same deep concern for the
                            importance of achieving a peaceful settlement of this long and tragic
                            conflict.</p>

                            BAHRAM MOLLA'I DARYANI. DESCRIBED AS FORMER IRANIAN LEFTIST STUDENT, IN
                            WHICH HE LEVELS SERIES OF CHARGES AGAINST US ORGANIZATIONS. STATING THAT
                            PLOTS AGAINST IRAN BY SOME EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAD BEEN PUBLICLY
                            EXPOSED. DARYANI IS QUOTED AS SAYING HE WANTED ALSO TO EXPOSE ROLE OF
                            WESTERN COUNTRIES IN FOMENTING TROUBLE AGAINST IRAN. ACCORDINGLY AFTER
                            EXTENSIVE TRAVELS IN US IN SIXTIES AND ALSO TO EUROPE, INCLUDING EAST
                            GERMANY, HE DECIDED TO RETURN TO IRAN TO TELL ALL WHICH HE DID AT PRESS
                            CONFERENCE JUNE 13.</p>
                        <p>2. DARYANI'S CHARGES REGARDING US ORGANIZATIONS SEEKING TO UNDERMINE IRAN
                            INCLUDE:</p>
                        <p>(1) SEVERAL US AGENCIES TRIED TO RECRUIT HIM TO WORK WITH CONFEDERATION
                            OF IRANIAN STUDENTS (<gloss target="#t_CIS1">CIS</gloss>) IN THE US.</p>
                        <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_CIS1">CIS</gloss> WAS "WORKING" FOR US AND ENJOYED
                            FULLEST POSSIBLE FREEDOM TO STAGE ANTI-IRANIAN DEMONSTRATIONS WHILE
                            OTHER AMERICAN GROUPS LIKE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY WERE UNDER CLOSE
                            SURVEILLANCE.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d130-02" facs="d130-02"/>
                        <p>(4) IN 1967 FBI ATTEMPTED RECRUIT HIM AND WHEN HE REFUSED FBI ARRANGED TO
                            HAVE HIM EXPELLED FROM COUNTRY.</p>
                        <p>(5) FBI AIDED AND ABETTED ANTI-IRANIAN ACTIVITIES IN US AND PLAYED ROLE
                            IN DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST SHAH DURING HIS VISITS TO US. DARYANI ACCUSES
                            FBI OF BEING IN TOUCH WITH STUDENT RINGLEADERS AND TIPPING THEM OFF AS
                            TO SHAH'S WHEREABOUTS SO THAT THEY COULD STAGE DEMONSTRATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. PRESS HEADLINES ALSO IMPLICATE CIA BUT STORIES IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE
                            PRESS HAVE NO REFERENCE TO <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. PERSIAN
                            PRESS CARRIES FULL TEXT OF DARYANI'S LENGTHY TWO-HOUR STATEMENT WHICH WE
                            NOW IN PROCESS OF TRANSLATING.</p>
                        <p>4. ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, DARYANI ENTERED US IN 1963 AND SPENT MOST OF
                            HIS TIME IN US UNTIL 1967 WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE AT HIS REQUEST
                            INSTEAD OF FACING CHARGES OF VIOLATING IMMIGRATION REGULATIONS. OUR FILE
                            INDICATES HE WAS NOT ONLY ACTIVE AMONG LEFTIST IRANIAN STUDENTS AND
                            PARTICIPATED IN DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST SHAH BUT ALSO HAD MEETINGS WITH
                            SOVIET INTELLIGENCE AGENTS IN US. THIS WAS CONVEYED TO APPROPRIATE
                            IRANIAN SECURITY AUTHORITIES IN 1968.</p>
                        <p>5. WE DO NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT PLAN ISSUE DENIAL
                            BUT IN ANSWER TO QUERIES USIS IS USING FOLLOWING STATEMENT: "ACCORDING
                            TO OUR INFORMATION, BAHRAM M. DARYANI (ALSO KNOWN AS DARIAN) VISITED THE
                            UNITED STATES SEVERAL TIMES BETWEEN 1963 AND 1967, WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED
                            TO LEAVE AT HIS REQUEST WHEN FACED WITH A COURT ORDER CHARGING HIM WITH
                            VIOLATION OF IMMIGRATION REGULATIONS, THERE IS NO TRUTH TO HIS
                            ALLEGATIONS AND WE CONSIDER HIS STORY A FABRICATION.”</p>
                        <p>6. COMMENT: DARYANI'S ALLEGATIONS AND HIS PERFORMANCE AT PRESS CONFERENCE
                            YESTERDAY ARE NOT FIRST (BUT ARE BY FAR MOST EXTREME) OF SOME THINLY

                                Washington on the defensive at a time when he was contemplating

                        <p>1. I SAW <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> ZAHEDI AT 3:00 P.M.
                            JUNE 14 TO DISCUSS DARYANI STORY (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>). I SAID I HAD NOT COME TO COMPLAIN OR MAKE PROTEST
                            BUT TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN AND DISMAY ABOUT DAMAGE THIS IRRESPONSIBLE
                            STORY COULD DO TO US-IRAN RELATIONS PARTICULARLY SINCE STORY HAD BEEN
                            FLOATED BY OFFICAL AGENCY OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.
                            (DARYANI STORY WAS TAPED FOR TV AND THEN PRESS WAS INVITED IN TO PREVIEW
                            IT.) I SAID BECAUSE STORY WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE WITH APPROVAL OF SOME
                            MINISTRY OR AGENCY OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, ANY READER
                            WOULD GAIN IMPRESSION GOT BELIEVED STORY WAS TRUE.</p>
                        <p>2. I THEN REVIEWED WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT DARYANI ALONG GENERAL LINES IN PARA
                            4 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss> BUT WITH A BIT MORE DETAIL
                            AND POINTED OUT THAT WE HAD BEEN IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH IRANIAN SECURITY
                            AUTHORITIES SINCE 1968 ON THIS CASE AND HAD COOPERATED WITH THEM IN
                            EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, AS FRIEND, TO HAVE QUERIED US
                            PRIVATELY ABOUT STORY RATHER THAN TO HAVE MADE PRESS SPECTACULAR OUT OF
                            IT.</p>
                        <p>3. ZAHEDI SAID HE WANTED ME TO KNOW PRIVATELY THAT HE FELT BADLY ABOUT
                            WAY STORY WAS HANDLED. HAD HE BEEN CONSULTED, HE WOULD NEVER HAVE AGREED
                            TO GIVING STORY TO PRESS BUT WOULD HAVE ASKED ME TO CALL TO DISCUSS IT
                            MAN TO MAN. HE <pb n="2" xml:id="d131-02" facs="d131-02"/>SAID HE HAD
                            BEEN IN TOUCH WITH COURT MINISTER ALAM (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) AND ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO KILL USE OF TV TAPE ON
                            TELEVISION TONIGHT. FURTHERMORE, HE HAD PERSONALLY CALLED AP AND REUTERS
                            CORRESPONDENTS ASKING THEM TO QUOTE EMBASSY STATEMENT SAYING STORY IS
                            FABRICATION (PARA 5 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) AND AT
                            SAME TIME SAY DARYANI STATEMENT REPRESENTED ONLY HIS VIEWS. HE ALSO HAD
                            ASKED MINISTER OF INFORMATION TO HAVE PAPERS CARRY SIMILAR APPROPRIATE
                            EXPLANATION ALONG THESE LINES. FINALLY, HE EXPRESSED HOPE WE WOULD KEEP
                            COOL. HE KNEW HOW EXASPERATED WE MUST FEEL BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS
                            AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON HE HAD HAD A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TYPE OF
                            UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE WHEN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY NOT ONLY
                            RECEIVED GROUP OF RADICAL IRANIAN STUDENTS THAT HAD BEEN ATTACKING SHAH
                            BUT HAD ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED THEM BY GIVING THEM BALL-POINT PENS WITH
                            PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">KENNEDY</persName>'S NAME
                            INSCRIBED THEREON. I ASSURED HIM WE HAD NOT LOST OUR COOL AND HAD NO
                            DESIRE TO MAGNIFY THIS INCIDENT. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ACTION HE HAD
                            TAKEN AND IMPORTANT THING WAS TO DAMP STORY DOWN AND IN FUTURE DISCUSS
                            WITH US PRIVATELY ANY SUCH CHARGES AGAINST US AS MIGHT COME TO ATTENTION
                            OE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. I THEN SAW COURT MINISTER ALAM AT 4:30 P.M. AND MADE SAME PITCH TO
                            HIM. I ALSO GAVE HIM MY PERSONAL VIEW, AS I HAD TO ZAHEDI, THAT THERE
                            SEEMED VERY REASONABLE PROSPECT THAT DARYANI, WHO HAD BEEN RECRUITED BY
                            SOVIETS MANY YEARS AGO, WAS STILL ACTUALLY IN THEIR EMPLOY AND ACTING AS
                            AGENT. BY HIS OWN STORY HE HAD BEEN IN EAST GERMANY FOLLOWING HIS
                            DEPORTATION FROM CANADA IN 1970. SINCE SOVIETS ARE FULLY AWARE OF KIND
                            OF TELEVISION SPECTACULARS <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS PUT
                            ON PREVIOUSLY WITH FORMER RADICAL STUDENTS WHO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY
                            RECANTED, WHAT BETTER WAY WAS THERE TO TRY TO DISCREDIT US AND DRIVE
                            WEDGE BETWEEN IRAN AND US THAN TO HAVE DARYANI ACT THE WAY HE HAD.</p>
                        <p>5. ALAM SAID HE HAD NOT SEEN STORY IN THIS MORNING'S PAPER AS HE HAD GONE
                            TO HIS OFFICE VERY EARLY TO PRESIDE OVER SOME MEETINGS. WHILE HE HAD
                            GIVEN ORDERS TO SCRUB TELEVISION OF DARYANI STORY TONIGHT, THE HEAD OF
                            TELEVISION HAD JUST CALLED HIM TO SAY THAT BEFORE ORDERS HAD BEEN
                            RECEIVED, IRAN TELEVISION HAD AT ABOUT 1:00 P.M. TODAY BROADCAST A
                            SEVERAL MINUTE STORY CALLING ATTENTION TO DARYANI STORY AND SAYING IT
                            WOULD BE TELEVISED TONIGHT. <pb n="3" xml:id="d131-03" facs="d131-03"/>HEAD OF IRAN TV NOW DID NOT KNOW HOW HE COULD EXPLAIN SCRUBBING STORY
                            AND THEREFORE ASKED PERMISSION TO USE IT TONIGHT. ALAM SAID HE TOLD HIM
                            FLATLY THAT SHAH HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO SCRUB STORY AND THAT WHILE HE WOULD
                            REPORT WHAT TV HEAD HAD SAID TO SHAH LATER, ORDERS TO SCRUB WERE STILL
                            VALID.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d131-04" facs="d131-04"/>
                        <p>6. I THEN ASKED ALAM PRIVATELY WHAT WAS BEHIND ALL THIS. DID SHAH OR
                            SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIALS REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE WERE CONNIVING WITH
                            COMMUNISTS TO CREATE INSTABILITIES IN ONLY REALLY STABLE COUNTRY IN THIS
                            AREA WITH WHOM WE HAD CLOSEST AND MOST FRIENDLY RELATIONS AND WITH WHOM
                            WE WERE TRYING TO COOPERATE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. ALAM REPLIED THAT
                            THERE WAS SOME FEELING IN CERTAIN QUARTERS (HE DID NOT SPECIFY) THAT WE
                            MIGHT DO MORE TO CURB DEMONSTRATIONS AND ACTIVITIES OF RADICAL IRANIAN
                            STUDENTS IN U.S. I SAID I UNDERSTOOD THAT GENERAL NASSERI HAD SOME SUCH
                            FEELING. I THEN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN FACT THAT GUARANTEES OF FREEDOM OF
                            SPEECH, PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY, ETC., EMBEDDED IN OUR CONSTITUTION APPLY NOT
                            ONLY TO US CITIZENS BUT LEGALLY RESIDENT FOREIGNERS AND THAT IF THEY DO
                            NOT BREAK LAW, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN DO TO PENALIZE THEM.
                            AT SAME TIME I WAS SURE HE, SHAH AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS KNEW THAT WE
                            WERE DOING OUR UTMOST TO COOPERATE IN EVERY WAY WITH IRAN AND AT SAME
                            TIME TO LIMIT TO EXTENT LEGALLY, POSSIBLE, UNFRIENDLY AND HOSTILE
                            ACTIONS BY RADICAL IRANIAN STUDENTS IN US AGAINST IRANIAN INSTALLATIONS
                            AND PERSONALITIES. ALAM SAID HE KNEW ALL THIS AND HE WOULD SEE SHAH AT
                            5:00. P.M. AND GIVE HIM FULL REPORT.</p>
                        <p>7. COMMENT: I BELIEVE WE HAVE DONE ALL WE CAN AT THIS JUNCTURE TO BRING
                            TO ATTENTION AT HIGHEST LEVEL HERE OUR CONCERN OVER EFFECT THAT THIS
                            KIND OF STORY AND WAY IT WAS HANDLED CAN HAVE ON OUR RELATIONS. I
                            DELIBERATELY <pb n="5" xml:id="d131-05" facs="d131-05"/>PITCHED MY
                            REPRESENTATIONS "MORE IN SADNESS THAN IN ANGER" AND I KNOW THAT WHAT I
                            SAID WAS SYMPATHETICALLY RECEIVED BY BOTH ZAHEDI AND ALAM WHO ARE GOOD
                            FRIENDS OF US. INDEED THAY WERE BOTH EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT. I WOULD,
                            THEREFORE, NOT RECOMMEND ANY FURTHER EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN OR
                            DISPLEASURE FROM WASHINGTON AT THIS TIME AND UNTIL I HAVE HAD FURTHER
                            TALK WITH ALAM, WHICH PROBABLY TAKE PLACE TOMORROW AFTERNOON OR
                            WEDNESDAY A.M. IN MEANTIME RECOMMEND WE CONTINUE TO STICK TO LINE WE
                            HAVE TAKEN HERE WITH PRESS (PARA 5 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>). IF <gloss target="#t_Dept1">DEPT</gloss> SHOULD BE
                            QUERIED AS TO WHETHER WE HAVE MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE SAY WE HAVE
                            NOT RPT NOT MADE ANY "REPRESENTATIONS" BUT THAT EMBASSY HAS MADE CLEAR
                            THAT THERE IS NO TRUTH IN DARYANI ALLEGATIONS AND THAT STORY IS OBVIOUS
                            FABRICATION.</p>

                            HE SAID HE HAD REPORTED FULLY TO SHAH ON OUR CONVERSATION ON JUNE 14
                            (PARA 5 AND 6, <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss> B) AND SHAH HAD
                            READ CAREFULLY AND WITH GREAT INTEREST CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM I GAVE
                            ALAN JUNE 14 FOR SHAH COVERING BOTH DARYANI'S ACTIVITIES IN US AND OUR
                            CLOSE COOPERATION WITH IRANIAN SECURITY AUTHORITIES ON THIS CASE SINCE
                            1968. ALAM AGAIN EXPRESSED REGRET ABOUT STORY, SAID IT WAS RESULT OF
                            EXCESS ZEAL BY <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>; THAT IT HAD BEEN
                            KILLED AND, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE PUBLISHED ABOUT IT HERE.</p>
                        <p>2. I THANKED ALAM BUT SAID I WANTED TO ASK VERY FRANKLY WHETHER THERE WAS
                            SOMETHING TROUBLING SHAH ABOUT ACTIONS OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> OR ANY OF ITS AGENCIES. I MENTIONED COMMENTS ATTRIBUTED
                            TO SHAH BY FRENCH CORRESPONDENT (PARA 6, <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss> C) AND SAID DARYANI STORY FOLLOWING ON REMARKS
                            ATTRIBUTED TO FRENCH CORRESPONDENT GAVE ME REAL CONCERN. I ASKED ALAM TO
                            TELL SHAH THAT IF HE HAD ANY CONCERNS OR DOUBTS ABOUT US FRIENDSHIP FOR
                            IRAN OR ABOUT ACTIVITIES OF ANY US OFFICIAL OR PRIVATE AGENCIES OR
                            PERSONALITIES, I TRUSTED HE WOULD BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS THEM PRIVATELY
                            WITH ME, FOR CONTINUED CLOSE COOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN IRAN AND
                            AND US REQUIRED ABSOLUTE FRANKNESS IN OUR RELATIONS. IF HE HAD ANY
                            COMPLAINTS I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM FOR IF WE COULD <pb n="2" xml:id="d132-02" facs="d132-02"/>NOT TALK FRANKLY ABOUT SUCH MATTERS
                            THERE WAS NOT MUCH PURPOSE IN MY BEING HERE AS AMBASSADOR.</p>
                        <p>3. ALAM SAID HE AGREED AND WOULD BE PLEASED TO TRANSMIT MY MESSAGE TO
                            SHAH. AT SAME TIME HE SAID SHAH HAD BEEN MISQUOTED BY FRENCH
                            CORRESPONDENT AND HAD NOT CHARGED THAT US INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WAS
                            COOPERATING WITH COMMUNISTS TO IRAN'S DETRIMENT BUT HAD REFERRED TO
                            BRITISH INTELLIGENCE. HE WENT ON THAT SHAH HAS HIGHEST REGARD FOR
                            PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> PERSONALLY AS
                            WELL AS OFFICIALLY AND THAT HE ALSO MUCH APPRECIATED FRANK AND CORDIAL
                            RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAD DEVELOPED WITH ME HERE IN TEHRAN. HE COULD ASSURE
                            ME, THEREFORE, THAT SHAH DID NOT BELIEVE USG WAS WORKING AGAINST IRAN'S
                            INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>4. I EXPRESSED THANKS BUT SAID I CONTINUED TO HAVE VISCERAL FEELING
                            SOMETHING MIGHT BE DISTURBING SHAH. ALAM REPLIED IN NEGATIVE BUT IN
                            SUBSEQUENT GIVE AND TAKE HE DID MENTION THERE WERE "SOME IRANIANS" THAT
                            STILL RECALLED:</p>
                        <p>(A) A "WAR GAME" ON IRAN CONDUCTED BY MIT ON BEHALF OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AGENCY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHICH WAS
                            UNFLATTERING TO IRAN AS WELL AS TO SHAH, PORTRAYING IT AS A SORT OF US
                            SATELLITE (I DO NOT HAVE DETAILS ON THIS.)</p>
                        <p>(B) INCIDENT INVOLVING ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY WITH ANTI-IRAN
                            STUDENTS IN WASHINGTON (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>
                            B).</p>
                        <p>(C) A CONFIDENTIAL STUDY CONDUCTED BY WHITE HOUSE STAFF AIDE ROBERT KOMER
                            DURING JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION WHICH WAS LEAKED AND RECEIVED WIDE
                            PUBLICITY IN PRESS. OBJECT OF STUDY WAS ALLEGEDLY TO DEVISE WAYS AND
                            MEANS FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO PUT PRESSURES ON IRAN
                            TO "DEMOCRATIZE.” HOWEVER, ALAM SAID ALL THIS WAS IN PAST AND WATER OVER
                            DAM AND NEITHER SHAH NOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> BELIEVED
                            REPORTS THAT AGENCIES OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WERE
                            WORKING AGAINST IRAN'S INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>5. ON EVENING OF JUNE 16 ALAM CALLED ME AGAIN. HE SAID HE HAD FULLY
                            REPORTED OUR JUNE 15 CONVERSATION ABOVE AND SHAH WANTED ME TO KNOW:</p>
                        <p>(A) THAT HE HAD FULL CONFIDENCE “<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> ADMINISTRATION" WAS STAUNCH FRIEND OF IRAN;</p>
                        <p>(B) THAT HE DID NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT BELIEVE
                            ALLEGATIONS THAT ANY <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AGENCIES WERE
                            WORKING AGAINST IRAN'S INTEREST. "AT SAME TIME,” ALAM SAID, "WE CANNOT
                            SAY THE SAME ABOUT THE BRITISH.”</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d132-03" facs="d132-03"/>
                        <p>7. COMMENT: (A) ALTHOUGH DARYANI STORY WAS UNPLEASANT INCIDENT FOR US
                            HERE AND CAUSED FLURRY OF SPECULATION IN TEHRAN AS TO WHAT WAS BEHIND
                            IT, WE BELIEVE ON BALANCE IT HAS PERHAPS BEEN USEFUL IN TERMS OF OUR
                            RELATIONS WITH SHAH. WHILE SHAH IS UNQUESTIONABLY OUTSTANDING LEADER IN
                            SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST ASIA AND WHILE BASICALLY HE REGARDS THE US AS ONE OF
                            HIS FIRMEST FRIENDS, HE DOES HAVE A BIT OF A SPLIT PERSONALITY AND AND
                            ELEPHANT-LIKE MEMORY ABOUT WHAT HE CONSIDERS PAST SLIGHTS SUCH AS THOSE
                            MENTIONED IN PARA 4 ABOVE. THIS, COUPLED WITH IS EARLY INSECURITIES IN
                            1940'S AND 1950'S WHEN HE WAS BADLY SHOVED AROUND, PARTICULARLY BY
                            BRITISH AND RUSSIANS, HAVE, WE BELIEVE, LEFT RESIDUE OF SUBCONSCIOUS AS
                            WELL AS CONSCIOUS SENSITIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, WHISPERING CAMPAIGN IN
                            TEHRAN IN MIDDLE AND LATE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES (WHICH IN LOW KEY
                            CONTINUES IN CERTAIN CIRCLES TODAY) THAT HE HAD ONLY RETAINED HIS THRONE
                            THANKS TO <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> MAY ALSO HAVE WORKED ON
                            HIS SUBCONSCIOUS.</p>
                        <p>(B) IN ANY EVENT, WE BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING POSITIVE HAS RESULTED FROM
                            DARYANI INCIDENT BECAUSE IT HAS ENABLED US AT HIGHEST LEVEL AND AT
                            SENIOR CABINET LEVEL TO IMPRESS IMPORTANCE OF DISCUSSING WITH US
                            PRIVATELY ANY CHARGES AGAINST ANY <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY BEFORE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            GIVES IT PUBLICITY HERE. FURTHERMORE, WHILE SHAH MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE
                            SEEN PRIVATE SHOWING OF DARYANI INTERVIEW ARRANGED FOR EDITORS AND
                            JOURNALISTS, IT OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC WITHOUT <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> GETTING GENERAL CLEARANCE FROM
                            PALACE. FACT THAT WHEN STORY BROKE WE BRANDED IT AS FALSE AND A
                            FABRICATION HAS ALSO SERVED TO LET PEOPLE IN HIGH QUARTERS HERE KNOW
                            THAT WE WILL NOT BE SHOVED AROUND AND REMAIN SILENT WHEN STORIES APPEAR
                            THAT ARE FALSE OR INACCURATE. FINALLY, WE BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN
                            THERAPEUTIC TO GET OUT ON TABLE AND HAVE FRANK DISCUSSION WITH ZAHEDI
                            AND ALAM (AND THROUGH ALAM WITH SHAH) ABOUT PAST INCIDENTS SUCH AS THOSE
                            MENTIONED IN PARA 4 ABOVE, WHICH CLEARLY STILL RANKLE AND UNTIL NOW AT
                            LEAST HAVE LEFT LINGERING RESIDUE OF SUSPICION.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d132-04" facs="d132-04"/>
                        <p>(C) AS WE ALL KNOW, SHAH IS PROUD, IMPERIOUS AND SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT
                            MAN. HE IS VERY SENSITIVE MAN. IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC INCIDENTS SUCH AS
                            THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE, HIS SENSITIVITIES ARE ALSO UNQUESTIONABLY WOUNDED
                            BY DEMONSTRATIONS OF RADICAL IRANIAN STUDENTS IN US AND ELSEWHERE ABROAD
                            ATTACKING HIM PERSONALLY AND WHAT HE HAS ACHIEVED. WHILE INTELLECTUALLY
                            HE RECOGNIZES THAT WE ARE DOING ALL WE LEGALLY CAN IN US TO PROTECT
                            IRANIAN INSTALLATIONS AND PERSONALITIES AND COOPERATE TO HELP IRAN
                            ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES IN MANY FIELDS, AT SAME TIME I HAZARD THAT EACH
                            TIME THERE IS ANTI-SHAH DEMONSTRATIONS IN US, HE PROBABLY SAYS TO HIS
                            ADVISERS: "WHY DO THE AMERICANS PERMIT THIS? WHY DON'T THEY DO SOMETHING
                            ABOUT IT OR DEPORT THESE STUDENTS. IF THEY DON'T BEHAVE?" (D) IN SPITE
                            OF COMPLEXITIES OF SHAH'S CHARACTER AND FACT THAT HE IS AT TIMES VERY
                            DIFFICULT INDEED, HE IS UNQUESTIONED LEADER OF ONLY STRONG, STABLE AND
                            AT SAME TIME VERY FRIENDLY COUNTRY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH IN GREAT ARC OF
                            SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST ASIA. FURTHERMORE, STRONG AND FRIENDLY IRAN (AND
                            THIS, OF COURSE, MEANS THE SHAH) IS ESSENTIAL TO MANY OF OUR OWN MOST
                            VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS AND THOSE OF OUR NATO ALLIES AND JAPAN BECAUSE
                            OF PERSIAN GULF. IF PEACE AND STABILITY IN VITALLY IMPORTANT GULF ARE TO
                            BE MAINTAINED AND WESTERN INTERESTS NOT JEOPARDIZED, PRINCIPAL BURDEN
                            MUST FALL ON IRAN. WHILE SHAH IS SOMETIMES QUERULOUS WITH US, HE IS ALSO
                            OFTEN QUERULOUS WITH OTHERS, INCLUDING SOME OF HIS OWN PRINCIPAL
                            ADVISERS. WE BELIEVE HE CONTINUES TO REGARD US AS ONE OF IRAN'S FIRMEST
                            AND MOST DEPENDABLE FRIENDS AND WE KNOW THAT HE HAS STRONG FEELING OF
                            RESPECT AND PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP FOR THE PRESIDENT. WHILE I AM,
                            THEREFORE, NOT PRESENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE OF US-IRAN RELATIONS SO
                            LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO COOPERATE AND BE FORTHCOMING, I AM DEEPLY
                            CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF A CRISIS IN BRITISH-IRAN RELATIONS, WHICH
                            IS BREWING EVER STRONGER AND WHICH MAY REACH CRISIS PROPORTIONS IF GULF
                            ISLANDS PROBLEM IS NOT SETTLED. THIS WILL BE SUBJECT OF SEPARATE
                            MESSAGE.</p>
                        <p>8. SORRY THIS MESSAGE IS SO LONG BUT ASSUMED YOU WOULD WISH FULL REPORT

                        </list>
                        <p>Last fall when the Cooper-Church Amendment was stalling the Foreign
                            Military Sales Act, the annual $100 million sales program to Iran was
                            shifted to the Export-Import Bank so that continuation of credits for
                            Iran would be assured if the legislation failed. To accomplish that
                            shift, Iran was reclassified under existing legislation as an
                            economically developed country. That change then brought the small
                            continuing grant military assistance program ($2.4 million primarily for
                            military training) under a prohibition in the Foreign Assistance Act
                            against grant military assistance to developed countries. In time, it
                            will be logical to remove Iran from the grant list. However, to do so
                            now would be to damage this relationship for no good reason.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 it is necessary for
                            you to wave the restriction in the Foreign Assistance Act. <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">George Shultz</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> recommend in the attached memoranda that you make
                            this waiver.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>We propose to furnish Iran an amount not to exceed $2,433,000 out of
                            funds made aVailable in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971
                            military assistance program. These funds will permit us to fulfill our
                            undertaking to provide Iran assistance on a grant basis consisting of
                            military training and support of our military mission there.</p>
                        <p>This modest assistance program performs two key functions: it supports
                            the United States Military Assistance Advisory Group (<gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss>) in Iran, and it permits
                            the training of the Iranian military in the United States and in Iran.
                            Both of these functions contribute to the strength of the Iranian Armed
                            Forces and to the ability of Iran to play a role in the maintenance of
                            stability in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>It is important to United States interests to continue to have Iran as a
                            strong, stable and reliable friend in the turbulent Middle East. Iran is
                            a firm ally which continues to take a positive and cooperative attitude
                            towards the achievement of common objectives in an area of political
                            instability.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> is our principal
                            vehicle for counselling the Iranian Armed Forces on all aspects of their
                            modernization and rationalization. Although Iran now has the capability
                            to purchase its military equipment requirements, <pb n="3" xml:id="d133-03" facs="d133-03"/>the Iranian Armed Forces are still
                            in need of expert advice and counsel on a multitude of organizational,
                            maintenance and support functions. <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> has this mission. It provides needed expertise
                            in the area of general military operations, force planning, training and
                            the use of modern weaponry and techniques.</p>
                        <p>It is also in our interest to provide training in the United States and
                            in-country to officers and men of the Iranian Armed Forces. Recent
                            surveys of the status of the Iranian Armed Forces, including a <gloss target="#t_GAO1">GAO</gloss> report on Military Assistance Training,
                            have pointed up a pressing need for more pilots and technical officers
                            as well as supervisory personnel in the enlisted grades. It is therefore
                            advisable to continue a training program to ensure that the Iranian
                            Armed Forces have a sufficient number of technicians to maintain an
                            adequate degree of operational readiness.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> training plus the presence of
                                <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> combine to give
                            the United States a position of friendship and influence vis-a-vis the
                            Iranian Armed Forces which we value highly. As concerns <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 we have already undertaken to make
                            available $2,433,000 in grant military assistance. The recent oil
                            settlement in Tehran is expected to increase significantly Iranian
                            foreign exchange receipts. Iran's ability to sustain an increasing share
                            of its defense burden is manifest. In future fiscal years it is our
                            intent therefore to reduce substantially <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> grant assistance to Iran. Withholding the sum under
                            reference, however, would be considered a failure on our part to fulfill
                            a firm undertaking and would have adverse effects on Iranian
                            planning.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Legal Aspects</p>
                        <p>Section 620(m) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, states
                            that grant assistance shall not be furnished "to any economically
                            developed nation capable of sustaining its own defense burden and
                            economic growth.” Iran is now considered to be subject to the
                            prohibition of Section 620(m).</p>
                        <p>Section 614(a) of the Act permits a Presidential waiver of restrictions
                            on furnishing assistance imposed <pb n="4" xml:id="d133-04" facs="d133-04"/>under the Act, including the restriction of Section
                            620(m), when the President determines that such authorization is
                            important to the security of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In light of considerations discussed above, I believe it would be
                            appropriate for you to determine, under the authority of Section 614(a),
                            that the provision of $2,433,000 in grant military assistance to Iran is
                            important to the security of the United States and authorize the
                            provision of this assistance without regard to the requirements of
                            Section 620(m).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you sign the attached determination and authorization,
                            pursuant to Section 614(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act, to permit the
                            grant of $2,433,000 in military assistance to Iran in fulfillment of the

                        <p> US success in pressuring Turkey to ban the further growing of opium by
                            mid-1972 has suggested that similar pressure be brought to bear on Iran.
                            The aim of this paper is to examine the best way to approach the Shah of
                            Iran to persuade him to ban future poppy production and the political,
                            social and economic effects a successful approach might have on the
                            country. (For background on the opium situation in Iran, see
                            Appendix.)</p>
                        <p>We are not persuaded that this is a useful move, however, and inject a
                            word of caution. We believe that an immediate demarche to the Shah would
                            probably be unwise for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. Iran is a victim of, not an exporter of, opium. Iran has about
                            one-quarter of the world's total opium users. Before Iran resumed legal
                            cultivation in 1969 most of Iran's requirements, some 380 tons a year,
                            were smuggled in, primarily from Afghanistan. To give some measure of
                            control over the narcotics situation, the Shah reinstituted poppy
                            cultivation concurrently with a strict program of addict registration
                            and control of illegal narcotics which apparently has been successful in
                            drastically reducing the amount of smuggled opium entering the country.
                            At the same time Tehran has embarked on a stringent smuggling
                            eradication program. More than 90 smugglers have been executed since the
                            beginning of the antidrug campaign in 1969.</p>
                        <p>2. Iran has a comprehensive and effective cultivation and harvesting
                            control program with registration of farmers, continuous observation of
                            the harvest, and guarded transport of opium.</p>
                        <p>3. The Shah is known to be strongly anti-drug. We believe the decision to
                            grow Iranian poppy was taken solely in a bid to control the serious
                            domestic problem. <pb n="3" xml:id="d136-03" facs="d136-03"/>He is on
                            record as saying that Iran will never become an opium exporter, and that
                            he will cease production of opium when Turkey and Afghanistan do. Until
                            Afghanistan is removed as a supplier to Iran, it is clearly a
                            non-starter to approach the Shah.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> US Approaches</p>
                        <p>Assuming US pressure on the Shah is decided upon, the manner of
                            presentation should be tentative and exploratory. Iranian handling of
                            its opium problem should not be criticized. The Shah feels his approach
                            is effective and responsible and he is increasingly sensitive to
                            criticism from any quarters on his handling of Iran's affairs.</p>
                        <p>A fruitful line might be to approach the Shah in terms of seeking his
                            advice on how to handle the problem area-wide. He likes to see himself
                            as a leader and innovator on a global scale. Seek his advice on how to
                            handle Afghanistan; he may well offer to carry the ball, or part of it,
                            there. He has probably given some thought to total elimination of poppy
                            cultivation in his own country. Let him expatiate on this on his own
                            initiative - or with a gentle nudge. He may well end up committing
                            himself - if he thinks it's his own idea.</p>
                        <p>Eliminating poppy cultivation in Iran is politically and economically
                            feasible. Since poppy is grown only on Government cooperatives, crop
                            substitution will present little problem to the farmers, though some
                            income supplement probably would be necessary to cover the loss of poppy
                            cultivation. The major question is what to do with 350,000 opium
                            users—their needs are the Shah's first and foremost concern. It seems
                            highly doubtful that Iran could purchase licitly the large quantities,
                            i.e. excess of 350 tons/yr., needed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reaction</p>
                        <p>The Shah's reactions to a US approach will be sympathetic, but negative.
                            Since his country is a net importer he feels this country, like the US,
                            is a victim. He considers the drug problem an internal matter, and any
                            US pressure would be viewed as meddling.</p>
                        <p>The best choice of a US envoy would be Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>. He understands the
                            sensitive nature in dealing <pb n="4" xml:id="d136-04" facs="d136-04"/>with <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>, and has the confidence of
                            the Shah. The Ambassador is also sensitive to the needs of the Iranians
                            and to their problems. He is properly deferential when it is called for,
                            and assertive when he feels the Shah will tolerate it. A stranger to the
                            court, who knows little of how to act in the presence of the "King of
                            Kings,” will likely do more harm than good.</p>

                        <p>The Opium Situation in Iran</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Historical Background to Iran's Opium
                            Problem</p>
                        <p>1. The cultivation of opium poppies and Iran's problems with opium
                            addiction date back hundreds of years and involve a series of
                            governmental attitudes and responses. Cultivation of opium poppy
                            initially took place in the western part of the country but expanded
                            rapidly during the 19th century to the south and central portions as the
                            stimulus of domestic usage and export demands increased. By the 1870's
                            the opium crop had assumed important economic implications for Iran with
                            exports in the decade 1871-1881 increasing in value almost twelve fold
                            and the product rivaling cotton in importance. Internal demands for
                            opium during this early phase increased with the availability of the
                            drug and the social acceptance of the practice which was almost
                            universal among the middle-aged and the elderly.</p>
                        <p>2. Official actions to control opium were initiated in 1910 with a ban on
                            non-medical use. In 1928 the government established a monopoly with the
                            aim of eliminating production by 1938. Both attempts proved abortive. By
                            1955, Iran had an estimated 1.5 million opium users, representing about
                            8% of the population. Iranian exports of opium, though licit channels
                            alone, amounted to 100 metric tons of about one-sixth of the total licit
                            world market. Considerably more were exported illicitly.</p>
                        <p>3. In 1955, Iran responded to international pressures by placing a
                            complete ban on opium production. As a result, a thriving illicit
                            commerce soon developed with Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Efforts
                            to interrupt the traffic across Iran's borders had only limited success,
                            with some smugglers shifting from easily detectible opium to smaller
                            packages of easily transportable heroin. The black market in opium
                            flourished and the loss of foreign exchange to Iran through illicit
                            traffic was considerable. The opium addict population declined, however,
                            to about 350,000 but was supplemented by hard-core (heroin) users
                            numbering about 50,000 plus undetermined numbers of users of lesser
                            drugs.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d136-06" facs="d136-06"/>
                        <p>4. Failure to obtain reciprocal controls from Turkey and Afghanistan,
                            coupled with the financial losses of the drug traffic, resulted in a
                            decision by the Shah in 1969 to resume domestic production of opium. At
                            the time, the Shah stated that Iran would exercise strict control over
                            opium production and would suspend production when Turkey and
                            Afghanistan adopted a ban on its cultivation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Opium Production and Policy Since 1969</p>
                        <p>5. The first crop, planted in March 1969 on 1,015 hectares and harvested
                            in May of that year yielded 7 tons of usable opium. Subsequently the
                            area of cultivation was expanded from 4,200 hectares in fall of 1969 to
                            6,200 hectares in March 1970, and to an authorized 12,050 hectares in
                            September 1970. The 1971 output is expected to be about 130 tons of
                            opium, a quantity barely sufficient to cope with the requirements of the
                            registered addicts. Registered addicts number about 65,000 or roughly
                            one-fifth of the addict population of about 350,000.</p>
                        <p>6. Controls over the production and distribution of opium are rigidly and
                            effectively carried out by the government through a variety of means.
                            Production control is administered by the Ministry of Land Reform which
                            recommends the hectarage for cultivation each year and, upon approval
                            from the Council of Ministers, allocates specific hectarage to
                            government-owned rural cooperatives and farm corporations. The
                            cooperatives police the individual member farmers engaged in poppy
                            cultivation, and members in turn keep an eye on each other since
                            violation by one would result in destruction of all poppy fields in the
                            cooperative. Prior to harvest, a government representative maintains
                            continual vigilance over the operation. As the latex is gathered, it is
                            weighed, tagged and stored in locked and supervised containers which are
                            transported under guard to government warehouses and eventually to the
                            Opium Monopoly. Weighing checks on the product are conducted at various
                            stages in the process to prevent "leakage" of the opium. Finally, the
                            Opium Monopoly processes the opium for controlled dissemination and sale
                            to registered addicts.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d136-07" facs="d136-07"/>
                        <p>7. In addition to the controls outlined above, the government pricing
                            policy, which provides the farmer with a premium price for his product,
                            tends to discourage illicit distribution of the domestic product. The
                            government pays the farmer approximately $90 per kilo of high grade
                            opium latex* compared with $10-15 in other producing countries. Since
                            the government sells opium to registered users at about $14 per kilo,
                            the government sustains a loss of at least $6 million annually.</p>
                        <p>* Lower grades sell as low as $55 per kilo.</p>
                        <p>8. The government follows a rigid enforcement policy meting out severe
                            punishment to those convicted of smuggling narcotics. The National
                            Police and the Gendarmerie are responsible for narcotic law enforcement
                            in the urban and rural areas, respectively. Anyone arrested for
                            trafficking in heroin or opium or in possession of more than ten grams
                            of heroin or two kilos of opium, is subject to the death penalty. Since
                            the law was enacted, 91 smugglers have been executed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Future Course of Action for Iran</p>
                        <p>9. Despite the penalties, Iran still is confronted with a severe
                            smuggling problem as opium from Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan finds
                            its way into the country to meet the demands of its extensive
                            non-registered addicts population. It is estimated that at least 250
                            tons of opium is smuggled into the country yearly.</p>
                        <p>10. With Turkey's decision to suspend production of opium in mid-1972,
                            supply requirements for the illicit Iranian market will undoubtedly
                            shift to the Afghan and West Pakistani supply channels. Of the two,
                            Afghanistan presents the major source of supply. Although intensified
                            efforts to police this area are being made, it seems doubtful that
                            supplies from this area can be totally eliminated without formal action
                            by the Afghan government.</p>
                        <p>11. Even if external supplies are curbed, Tehran would still be left with
                            the problem of treating its mammoth opium <pb n="8" xml:id="d136-08" facs="d136-08"/>addict population. One course of action open to the
                            Iranians would be to expand the current program to produce sufficient
                            opium to meet its domestic requirements. This would entail a possible
                            five-fold increase in size of the hectarage devoted to opium poppy,
                            conceivably as much as 60,000 hectares. Such an expended program not
                            only would entail significantly larger expenditures for farmer subsidies
                            (possibly as much as $30 million) but it raises the distinct possibility
                            that size alone would defeat efforts at proper control. It is
                            conceivable that Iran could find itself in the position of being a
                            source of illicit opium for the world market.</p>
                        <p>12. At the other extreme is complete abolition of opium production in
                            Iran. Such action, tried abortively in the past, would mean that Iran
                            would have to import (with loss of some valuable foreign exchange) the
                            opium needed to treat its addicts both registered and potentially
                            registerable, and its legitimate medical needs. The availability of such
                            additional opium from other world producers pose insoluble problems of
                            who to allow licit production at the expense of Iran, and how to explain
                            US involvement in world opium transactions.</p>
                        <p>13. A third course of action open to Iran and the US would be to retain
                            opium production in Iran at its present levels while focusing additional
                            financial and human resources on the treatment of unregistered addicts.
                            Such a program would call for additional assistance from the US, in the
                            form of training in the establishment of treatment centers, education,
                            and police surveillance.</p>

                            the Ambassador's views to Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, and I am now having my experts look into
                            technical end other aspects of assisting the Iranians in this problem. I
                            will let you know what their findings are.</p>
                        <p>Below follows the text of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s message to you:</p>
                        <p>“I have become increasingly concerned at the extent to which insecurity
                            of Iranian communications probably reveals to the Soviets details of
                            Iranian-U.S. diplomacy. Over a period of time this could become a
                            serious obstacle to effective pursuit of our national interests and
                            Soviet knowledge could be exploited by them to the deterrent of our
                            close and valuable relationships with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“Over the past year or so, various agencies of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> at first somewhat diffidently sought
                            our advice and assistance in improving the security and effectiveness of
                            intelligence and diplomatic circuits. Recently their requests have
                            become more insistent and sharply focused. [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] The latest request came from Foreign Minister
                            ZAHEDI who on 19 July expressed to me serious misgivings about his
                            communications and asked me for assistance in improving the Foreign
                            Ministry's cryptographic procedures.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d138-02" facs="d138-02"/>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has the means to obtain more
                            sophisticated equipment from sources other than the U.S. Government.
                            There is no doubt whatever to my mind that they will go this route if
                            they find our response negative or equivocal. We have seen many examples
                            of this tendeney in their procurement of military equipment and in their
                            current efforts to procure eloctronic equipment. Sooner or later we are
                            going to have to face this issue squarely and it is my view that our
                            long run interests will be best served if we face it now.</p>
                        <p>“Due to the extreme sensitivity of this matter and because I also
                            discussed it briefly with Dick Helms during his recent visit here, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] I would appreciate your
                            reaction to above after you and Dick have had an oportunity to consider
                            what we may be able to do.”</p>

                            SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. FOLLOWING IS VERBATIM REPEAT OF LETTER RECEIVED 7 AUG 71 FROM LTG
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">TOUFANIAN</persName>, DEPUTY MINISTER
                            OF WAR FOR ARMAMENTS, WHO WE UNDERSTAND WAS ACTING ON DIRECT
                            INSTRUCTIONS OF SHAH.</p>
                        <p>QUOTE: DEAR GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">TWITCHELL</persName>,</p>
                        <p>1. THE PURPOSE OF THIS LETTER IS TO CONFIRM OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS
                            WHEREIN I EXPLAINED THAT IT IS THE DESIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO
                            PURCHASE ITS US DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT THROUGH <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> PROCEDURES.</p>
                        <p>2. THE FOREIGN PURCHASE AND ORDERS DEPARTMENT HAS ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS
                            WITH US CONTRACTORS ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. WE HAVE VIEWED THESE
                            DISCUSSIONS AS A METHOD OF GATHERING INFORMATION IN SOME INSTANCES.
                            THESE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED AS NEGOTIATIONS BY US
                            CONTRACTORS, WHICH HAVE LED TO MISUNDERSTANDINGS. IT IS OUR DESIRE TO
                            AVOID MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN THE FUTURE.</p>
                        <p>3. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROCUREMENT CAPABILITY OF THE IIA, WHILE BEING
                            INCREASED, HAS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED, AND EXPERIENCE IN NEGOTIATION OF
                            COMPLEX SYSTEMS TO INCLUDE ALL IMPORTANT FEATURES SUCH AS SPARES,
                            SUPPORT, TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AND SUPPLY FACTORS IS
                            STILL LIMITED. IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THE IIA FULLY POSSESSES THE
                            NECESSARY COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS TO NEGOTIATE COMPLEX
                            PROCUREMENTS WITH ASSURANCE OF FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICES AND KNOWLEDGE
                            THAT ALL EQUPMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN
                            CONSIDERED.</p>
                        <p>4. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE, THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN REQUESTS THAT
                            PROCUREMENT FROM THE US OF ALL MAJOR WEAPONS/DEFENSE SYSTEMS, MAJOR
                            EQUIPMENTS, AND RELATED CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES BE EFFECTED THROUGH
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> PROCEDURES. IF THE GOVERNMENT OF
                            IRAN COULD BE ASSURED THAT THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD AS A MATTER OFPOLICY
                            ACCEPT SUCH REQUESTS TO CONTRACT VIA <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>, IT WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE TO US IN PLANNING EQUIPMENT <pb n="3" xml:id="d140-03" facs="d140-03"/>ACQUISITION AND IN DEALING
                            WITH US FIRMS. IN THIS REGARD THREE SYSTEMS ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR
                            PROCUREMENT AT THIS TIME: TOW MISSILE, IMPROVED HAWK AND F-5E AIRCRAFT.
                            REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RESPECTIVE FIRMS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF OUR
                            DESIRES TO UTILIZE <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> PROCEDURES IN THE
                            EVENT WE PURCHASE THESE WEAPONS SYSTEMS. YOU WILL BE ADVISED OF OUR
                            INTENT TO PURCHASE AS SOON AS THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FIRM. I WILL NOTIFY
                            YOU OF OTHER SYSTEMS/EQUIPMENTS TO BE PROCURED AS SOON AS THEY ARE
                            INDENTIFIED.</p>
                        <p>5. PLEASE ADVISE ME OF YOUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IN THIS MATTER.</p>

                            UNQUOTE.</p>
                        <p>2. IRANIANS ARE TAKING ACTIONS TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT
                            ORGANIZATION INCLUDING REORGANIZATION OF THEIR CENTRAL PROCUREMENT
                            ACTIVITY AND AUGMENTATION OF SKILLED PERSONNEL. IT WILL BE SOMETIME,
                            HOWEVER, BEFORE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS THE EXPERIENCE
                            AND CAPABILITY TO DEAL ADEQUATELY WITH MAJOR AND COMPLEX CONTRACTS OF
                            THIS KIND. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS ATTEMPTED SOME MAJOR
                            DIRECT PROCUREMENTS FROM US FIRMS WHICH IT BELIEVES TURNED OUT TO BE
                            UNSATISFACTORY BECAUSE OF ITS LACK OF EXPERTISE. THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE
                            IN SOME CASES LEFT A RESIDUE OF FEELING THAT IS NOT HELPFUL TO AMERICAN
                            CONTRACTORS. BECAUSE OF POLICY RESTRICTIONS ON US ADVISOR INVOLVEMENT IN
                            DIRECT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND US
                            FIRMS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GIVE ADEQUATE ADVICE IN DIRECT
                            NEGOTIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THE SHAH LOOKS TO <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> FOR PRECISELY THIS KIND OF ADVICE. IN VIEW OF
                            PAST EXPERIENCE AND AVOWED LACK OF EXPERTISE, SHAH FEELS THAT FOR THE
                            PRESENT AT LEAST, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> PROCUREMENT
                            ORGANIZATION AND EXPERTISE OFFERS ONLY RELIABLE ASSURANCE OF QUALITY
                            ITEMS AT FAIR PRICES IN PURCHASES FROM US.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d140-04" facs="d140-04"/>
                        <p>3. AVAILABILITY OF <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> PURCHASE
                            PROCEDURES WILL STRONGLY SUPPORT CONTINUED PURCHASES BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> OF US MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN LIEU OF
                            THIRD COUNTRY. WE HAVE BEEN SO INFORMED BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> OFFICIALS AND HAVE SEEN SPECIFIC CASES OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> CONTRACTING WITH THIRD COUNTRY SOURCES
                            ONCE <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> ROUTE HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN.
                            CONTINUED US SUPPLY OF IRANIAN ARMED FORCES AND MINIMIZATION OF THIRD
                            COUNTRY INFLUENCE WILL HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS BOTH FOR COMBAT
                            EFFECTIVENESS OF IIA AND FURTHERENCE OF US INTERESTS. <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> AUTHORIZATION FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> PURCHASES WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT AID
                            SUPPORT OF THESE GOALS.</p>
                        <p>4. COUNTRY TEAM STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> BE PERMITTED TO PURCHASE MAJOR WEAPONS/DEFENSE SYSTEMS
                            THROUGH <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> AS MATTER OF POLICY, THEREBY
                            AVOIDING CASE BY CASE DETERMINATIONS WHICH HAVE OFTEN PROVED SENSITIVE
                            AND LENGTHY. ONE ROUTE WHICH APPEARS PARTICULARLY PROMISING AND TO WHICH
                            WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN IS GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT
                            SUCH AS WE UNDERSTAND EXISTS BETWEEN THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND FRG, WHICH WOULD STIPULATE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DESIRES WITH REGARD TO <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> PURCHASE PER QUOTED LETTER AND <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> REQUESTS.</p>

                            DIRECTED HIM TO EXPAND HIS ORGANIZATION, DEVELOP OVER-ALL MANAGEMENT
                            STAFF, AND ESTABLISH NEW PROCEDURES. SHAH HAS TOLD TOUFANIAN TO LOOK FOR
                            SOME WELL-QUALIFIED CIVILIANS AND HAS AUTHORIZED HIM TO EMPLOY
                            APPROPRIATE FOREIGN CONSULTANTS. IN FIRST PLACE, HOWEVER, SHAH WANTS

                                The lavish 2500th celebrations, held October 1971 at Persepolis,
                                commemorated the anniversary of Cyrus the Great's founding of the
                                Achaemenian Empire. On November 19, David Abshire replied to a
                                letter of concern, forwarded by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, that the Shah
                                had pre-emptively rounded up 39 dissidents on August 23, and
                                sentenced most to death. Abshire wrote that “The Iranian government
                                has acted energetically to round up the terrorist groups, as would
                                any government in similar circumstances. In our opinion these
                                dissident elements in Iran … are in no way representative of the
                                views of the great majority of the Iranians, who support the Shah
                                and his government.” (<gloss target="#t_NEAIRN1">NEA/IRN</gloss>,

                        </p>
                        <p>The British and Iranians have agreed in principle on an arrangement for
                            resolving the dispute over the Gulf islands of Tunbs and Abu Musa in a
                            manner meeting Iran's basic claim to sovereignty but providing
                            facesaving and important financial concessions to the Arab shaykhs
                            involved. The British still face the difficult task of obtaining the
                            agreement of the Arab shaykhs to this arrangement. September 7 the Shah
                            conveyed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> the message that he can go no further to
                            accommodate the British. If the agreement does not materialize because
                            of the shaykhs' resistance, the Shah wants us to know that:</p>
                        <p>a) Iran's relations with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will be
                            seriously jeopardized;</p>
                        <p>b) Iran will denounce the proposed Federation of Arab Amirates; and</p>
                        <p>c) Iran will reserve its right to take such action as it deems necessary
                            to protect its national interest.</p>
                        <p>The Shah has passed the same message to the British Government.</p>
                        <p>I agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>'s assessment (Tehran 4970, Tab C) that the
                            Islands' dispute has now reached a crucial stage in which the British
                            must persuade the shaykhs to accept the arrangement negotiated <pb n="2" xml:id="d143-02" facs="d143-02"/>with Iran if there is to be
                            stability and cooperation in the Gulf after British withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>While I am certain that the British will make a sincere effort to
                            persuade the shaykhs to accept the agreement, I think we should be on
                            record as encouraging this British effort. I believe the proposed letter
                            from you to <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Douglas-Home</persName> is the
                            best way to assure that the British appreciate the seriousness with
                            which we regard this problem. I suggest we cable the text of the letter
                            to London for delivery prior to receipt of the signed original.</p>

                                said that “Increasingly he [the Shah] may have anxieties about
                                having his bluff called since he cannot want to use force if he can
                                avoid it, thus jeopardising his relations both with the Gulf States
                                and the whole Arab world… He is, of course, as we all know, a very

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF STATE<lb/> WASHINGTON<lb/> September 13, 1971</p>
                        <p>Dear ALEC:</p>
                        <p>Since we discussed the Gulf Islands dispute in London last April, I have
                            followed this difficult problem with continuing interest. I now
                            understand that Sir WILLIAM LUCE has negotiated an agreement in
                            principle with the Iranians on an arrangement which would satisfy basic
                            Iranian demands. I consider this a significant and encouraging
                            development and wish to express my great admiration for the skill
                            displayed on your side in bringing about this agreement.</p>
                        <p>We have received a message from the Shah indicating that the terms to
                            which he has agreed are as far as he can go in being accommodating on
                            this question. He has told us that if the Arab shaykhs refuse to accept
                            the terms to which the United Kingdom and Iran have agreed,
                            Anglo-Iranian relations will be seriously jeopardized, Iran will
                            denounce the proposed Federation of Arab Amirates, and Iran will reserve
                            its rights to take such action as it deems necessary to protect its
                            national interest. I am informed that the Shah has conveyed a similar
                            message to you.</p>
                        <p>I fully understand the difficulty of bringing the Arab shaykhs to accept
                            this arrangement. I am confident, however, that the terms which you have
                            negotiated on their behalf are as good as the shaykhs can expect.</p>
                        <p>I know we are fully in accord that an amicable settlement of this nature
                            is essential if there is to be cooperation and stability in the Gulf in
                            the <pb n="2" xml:id="d144-02" facs="d144-02"/>future. In looking at
                            ways we might assist, I see little we could add to your efforts at this
                            time to influence the Gulf shaykhs. We do intend, however, to reply to
                            the Shah that we are confident the United Kingdom will make every effort
                            to bring this promising opportunity for a settlement to a successful
                            conclusion.</p>

                            country.</p>
                        <p>b. Provide appropriate assistance and advisory services to recipient
                            countries on security assistance.</p>
                        <p>4. The policy channel of communication is from <gloss target="#t_OSDISA1">OSD/ISA</gloss>, or the Joint Chiefs of Staff through Unified
                            Commands to the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s. The Military
                            Services are not authorized direct communication on matters concerning
                            policy, strategic, or military operational considerations. <pb n="2" xml:id="d145-02" facs="d145-02"/>Clearly the individual Military
                            Services have no authority or responsibility for policy decisions of the
                            nature represented by the hiring of Major General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> as a military consultant to
                            the Shah of Iran.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> General Counsel's
                            opinion is that it would be illegal for Major General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> to accept such employment
                            and continue on the military retired rolls without enactment of a
                            "private bill" by Congress approving such employment. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would oppose enactment of a private
                            bill on a policy basis in that we believe it to be unacceptable to
                            interpose a third party between the Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the government to which he is accredited. Further,
                            it is undesirable to establish a precedent for situations wherein a
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief could accrue to himself
                            the opportunity for future financial gain by becoming the host
                            government's proponent rather than that of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>This letter confirms earlier telephone communication requesting that
                            action on Major General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName>'s employment by the Shah of Iran be stopped.
                            For your further consideration, I recommend that this letter be used as
                            background for policy in any related cases which may arise in the

                        <p>1. FOR PAST SEVERAL MONTHS SHAH HAS BEEN PRESSING US WITH INCREASING
                            FIRMNESS ON HIS NEED TO ACQUIRE WHAT HE REFERS TO AS AN ELECTRONIC
                            COUNTER MEASURES (ECM) CAPABILITY. IN DISCUSSING THIS QUESTION WITH ME,
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassifed</hi>] AND GEN <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">TWITCHELL</persName>, SHAH HAS TENDED TO LUMP
                            TOGETHER WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY THREE SEPARATE BUT RELATED ASPECTS (SEE
                            BELOW) OF OVER-ALL PROBLEM WHICH I BELIEVE IN HIS MIND IS QUESTION HOW
                            TO COPE WITH ALL ASPECTS OF ENEMY CAPABILITY WHICH INCORPORATE
                            ELECTRONIC FEATURE IN ONE OR ANOTHER FORM.</p>
                        <p>2. WE HAVE SUGGESTED TO SHAH THAT THE QUESTION CAN BE ADDRESSED MORE
                            CONSTRUCTIVELY IF WE AGREE TO DIVIDE IT INTO THREE PARTS: (1) PURE FCM,
                            (2) COMMUNICATIONS, AND (3) WEAPONS SYSTEMS. OUR COROLLARY PURPOSE IN
                            DOING THIS HAS BEEN TO ENABLE BOTH HIM AND US TO MEASURE PROGRESS WHICH
                            HAS BEEN MADE IN ONE OR ANOTHER OF HXREE AREAS AND TO DEFINE EXTENT TO
                            WHICH OUR PRESENT RESPONSES AND PROGRAMS ARE ADEQUATE OR INADEQUATE IN
                            TERMS OF HS ASSESSMENT OF HIS REQUIREMENTS. IN FIRST AREA WE HAVE MADE
                            SUBSTANTIAL CONCRETE PROGRESS. IN SECOND, WE HAVE HAD ENCOURAGING
                            INDICATION THAT MODIFICATION OF <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> APPLICATION OF <pb n="2" xml:id="d146-02" facs="d146-02"/>OUR NATIONAL DISCLOSISE POLICY (<gloss target="#t_Dept1">DEPT</gloss>'S A-35, JULY 7, 1971) WILL ENABLE US
                            TO BE FAR MORE CONSTRUCTIVE THAN IN PAST.</p>
                        <p>3. HOWEVER, I AM. MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THIRD AREA—WEAPONS SYSTEMS-FOR IT
                            IS IN THIS AREA THAT OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN LEAST FORTHCOMING AND IT
                            SEEMS EVIDENT THAT SHAH FINDS OUR POSITION EQUIVOCAL AND THEREFORE
                            IRRITATING. IN 141400Z OF 14 JUNE '71 CHIEF, <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> OUTLINED STATE OF PLAY,
                            WHICH, IN ESSENCE WAS THAT SHAH WISHED TO ACQUIRE SHRIKE MISSILE FROM
                            US. CHIEF, <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> REQUESTED
                            RESPONSE FROM WASHINGTON COVERING AVAILABILITY OF SHRIKE, DETAILS AS TO
                            COST AND OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN PROCUREMENT OF IT BY IRANIANS AND, IF
                            RESPONSE ON AVAILABILITY WERE NEGATIVE, "A RATIONALE FOR REFUSAL WHICH
                            WE CAN PRESENT TO THE IRANIANS.” <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> REPLIED IN 092104Z OF 9 JULY. THIS TELEGRAM
                            SIMPLY RAISES OBVIOUS QUESTIONS OF IRAN'S NEED FOR SYSTEM—IN TERMS OF
                            OUR INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS—AND OUR ABILITY UNDER EXISTING RESTRICTIONS
                            TO SELL IT TO IRAN. IT LEAVES BOTH OF THESE QUESTIONS UNANSWERED
                            ALTHOUGH IT DOES SUGGEST THAT PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AS WE ASSESS THEM
                            MAY NOT WARRANT ACQUISITION OF A SYSTEM OF THIS NATURE, AND EXPRESSES
                            BELIEF THAT "CERTAIN COGENT FACTORS INVOLVED IN IRAN'S ACQUISITION OF
                            THIS WEAPON SYSTEM SHOULD BE ILLUSTRATED.”</p>
                        <p>4. ON AUGUST 7 THIS EMBASSY RE-RAISED QUESTION (TEHRAN 43321) REQUESTING
                            A DATE ON WHICH US POSITION WOULD BECOME KNOWN AND REASONS FOR DELAY IN
                            DECISION WHICH COULD BE GIVEN TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. IT
                            ALSO EXPRESSED VIEW THAT “CJ WOULD BE MOST UNFORTUNATE IF DELAYS IN
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> DECISION—WHICH UNEXPLAINED COULD
                            BE TAKEN FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> RELUCTANCE—WERE TO
                            PRECIPITATE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DECISION TO GO
                            THIRD-COUNTRY ROUTE WHICH MIGHT PROVE MORE EXPENSIVE AND LESS EFFECTIVE
                            AND ALSO COMPLICATE <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> ARMAMENTS AND
                            TRAINING.” ON 10 AUGUST WASHINGTON REPLIED (JOINT STATE/DEFENSE MESSAGE
                            645375) THAT QUESTION OF OVER-ALL SAM DEFENSE FOR IIAF WAS UNDER ACTIVE
                            STUDY BY JOINT STAFF AND THAT ESTIMATED COMPLETION OF THIS STUDY WOULD
                            PERMIT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO RESPOND TO G0I REQUEST BY
                            MID-SEPTEMBER.</p>
                        <p>5. SHAH RAISED THIS QUESTION AGAIN WITH GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">TWITCHELL</persName> ON AUGUST 14 AND AGAIN
                            DURING <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">TWITCHELL</persName>'S FAREWELL
                            AUDIENCE ON SEPTEMBER 23. COURT MINISTER ALAM HAS, ON SHAH'S
                            INSTRUCTIONS, <pb n="3" xml:id="d146-03" facs="d146-03"/>ALSO RAISED IT
                            TWICE WITH ME IN LAST TWO WEEKS. I STALLED WITH ALUR AND GEN <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">TWITCHELL</persName>'S RESPONSE HAD NECESSARILY
                            TO BE LIMITED TO OBSERVATION THAT QUESTION BEING STUDIED IN WASHINGTON
                            IN LIGHT OF OUR EXPERIENCES IN VIET NAM WHICH PROVIDE A BROAD BASE TO
                            EXAMINE AREA OF ANTI-<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> SYSTEMS.</p>
                        <p>6. AS I HAVE POINTED OUT IN PAST, IS ENTIRELY UNREALISTIC FOR US TO
                            SUPPOSE THAT IN ABSENCE OF AN IRONCLAD GUARANTEE TO COME TO HIS
                            ASSISTANCE MILITARILY, WE CAN HOPE TO IMPOSE OUR INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES
                            OF SHAH'S REQUIREMENTS ON SHAH WHEN HIS OWN ESTIMATES DIFFER MARKEDLY
                            FROM THEM. HE REGARDS HIMSELF, QUITE NATURALLY, AS RESPONSIBLE FOR
                            SECURITY OF HIS COUNTRY AND PEOPLE AND AS PERSON BEST ABLE TO ASSESS HIS
                            REQUIREMENTS. THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER IN MY MIND THAT HE WILL SEEK TO
                            FULFILL THEM BY WHATEVER MEANS HE CAN FIND. HE HAS MEANS TO DO THIS AND
                            THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE ONLY TOO ANXIOUS TO SELL TO IRANIANS SYSTEMS OF
                            INDIFFERENT CAPABILITY WHICH IRANIANS WILL BE OBLIGED TO BUY IN ABSENCE
                            OF A FORTHCOMING RESPONSE FROM US. WE CANNOT, IN SUM, CONTROL EITHER
                            SHAH'S THINKING OR ACTIONS WHICH HE TAKES AS RESULT OF IT. WE HAVE, UF
                            COURSE, SOUGHT TO INFLUENCE HIS THINKING IN DIRECTION OF THE PRACTICAL
                            IN TERMS OF AVAILABILITY OF IRANIAN PERSONNEL TO MAN AND MAINTAIN
                            VARIOUS EQUIPMENT WHICH HE HAS AND HE WANTS TO ACQUIRE, AND IN MANY
                            INSTANCES OUR INFLUENCE HAS HAD SOME DEFINITE IMPACT. HOWEVER, SHAH IS
                            GETTING RESTLESS ON THIS MATTER AND UNLESS WE CAN BE FORTHCOMING OUR
                            INFLUENCE IS GOING TO BE ERODED: SHAH'S IRRITATION WILL BE INFLAMED AT
                            EXPENSE OF OUR OVER-ALL EXCELLENT RELATIONS THAT SERVE OUR NATIONAL
                            INTERESTS SO WELL: AND HE WILL TURN ELSEWHERE.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d146-04" facs="d146-04"/>
                        <p>7. WE HAVE AT PRESENT TIME A SITUATION WHICH IS SIMILAR IN MANY RESPECTS
                            TO THAT WHICH OBTAINED IN 1970. THE ISSUE AT THAT TIME WAS WHETHER, ON
                            POLICY GROUNDS, WE SHOULD PERMIT SHAH TO BUY ADDITIONAL F-4 AND C-130
                            AIRCRAFT. I OUTLINED MY THINKING AT THAT TIME IN A TELEGRAM TO YOU
                            (TEHRAN 3144, JULY 22, 1970) IN WHICH I CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT
                            CONTINUED EQUIVOCATION ON OUR PART WAS EROSIVE OF OUR POSITION HERE AND
                            THAT "IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF OUR REFUSING TO LET IRAN PURCHASE
                            THESE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT WE OWE IT TO THE SHAH TO TELL HIM SO AND WHY.
                            HOWEVER, IF WE DO SO, HE WOULD TAKE SUCH ACTION ON OUR PART AS PERSONAL
                            AFFRONT AND A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND AS CLEAR INDICATION THAT
                            DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT TO
                            COOPERATE WITH IRAN IN MEETING WHAT HE CONSIDERS ITS ESSENTIAL SECURITY
                            REQUIREMENTS. AS I HAVE POINTED OUT, THIS WILL INEVITABLY-LEAD TO A
                            DEFINITE ESTRANGEMENT WITH SHAH AND IRAN.”</p>
                        <p>8. OUR PROBLEM TODAY IS NOT PRECISELY AS IT WAS THEN SINCE WE DO NOT
                            PPESENTLY HAVE ADDED COMPLICATION OF AN ASSURANCE AT HIGHEST LEVEL OF
                            OUR GOVERNMENT THAT SHRIKE SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE, WHEREAS IN 1970 SUCH AN
                            ASSURANCE HAD BEEN MADE WITH RESPECT TO AIRCRAFT WHICH HE WANTED.
                            PRESENT SITUATION HAS NONETHELESS SAME BASIC ELEMENTS OF DANGER TO
                            US-IRAN RELATIONS AS F-4 AND C-130 PROBLEM IN 1970 AND IS ONE WHICH
                            CONCERNS ME GREATLY AND WHICH I FEEL WE MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH AT
                            ONCE,</p>
                        <p>9. WHEN I ACCOMPANIED SHAH TO LAKE VAN SEPT 27 FOR OPENING OF IRAN-TURKEY
                            RAIL LINK, HE SAID HE WISHED TO SEE ME IN <pb n="5" xml:id="d146-05" facs="d146-05"/>NEXT WEEK OR TEN DAYS BEFORE I DEPART ON HOME LEAVE
                            OCTOBER 21 AS THERE WERE "SOME MATTERS HE MUST DISCUSS" WITH ME. I

                            SUSPICIONS ON THIS SUBJECT, I WOULD APPRECIATE BEING AUTHORIZED TO

                        </list>
                        <p>Over the past three months the Shah of Iran has repeatedly and
                            insistently raised with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> in Tehran his strong desire to have Major
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName>, retiring
                            Chief of the U.S. Military Advisory Mission to Iran, be a member of a
                            Stanford Research Institute group which the Government of Iran is
                            retaining to supply advisory, consulting and analytical services in
                            civil and military engineering and management systems. The Shah has
                            expressed great confidence in Twitchell's capabilities and the
                            contribution he can make to Iranian development in these important
                            fields.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has
                            strongly supported this proposal, pointing out that in addition to the
                            Shah's great interest, we can expect General <persName corresp="#p_TMGH1">Twitchell</persName> to have an important and
                            favorable influence on the direction of Iranian military purchases.</p>
                        <p>I have over several weeks discussed this matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and others in the
                            Department of Defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> has taken exception to the Shah's request on the
                            grounds that Twitcheli's <pb n="2" xml:id="d147-02" facs="d147-02"/>employment would be in violation of the intent of the U.S.
                            Constitution and could raise questions of conflict of interest. He feels
                            such employment could create a vulnerability in terms of Congressional
                            sensitivities to the U.S. advisory, role abroad and to hostile media
                            alert for opportunities to discredit the U.S. military. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> has accordingly ruled
                            against approval.</p>
                        <p>We do not dispute the contention that the foregoing considerations should
                            be taken into account in reaching a decision on this matter. We feel,
                            however, that the excellence of our relations with Iran and the Shah
                            personally, is of overriding importance and that we should be responsive
                            to his request. We believe possible Congressional criticism could be
                            countered on the grounds of our helping an important and staunch friend.
                            There are precedents of employment of former U.S. military advisory
                            officers in foreign countries and the Department of Defense Directive
                            1005.3, Section VII, provides for an exception to the prohibition of
                            such employment with the approval of the Secretary of the appropriate
                            military department.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has
                            predicted that if he does not receive satisfaction the Shah will make a
                            direct approach to the President. It is also possible that the Shah may
                            raise the issue with the Vice President during his visit to Iran for the
                            25th Centenary celebrations.</p>
                        <p>We think this arrangement would be in the national interest, and propose
                            that the Secretary of Defense approve an exception to the Directive by
                            the Secretary of the Army.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Your visit to Iran is essentially an expression of our respect and
                            friendship for the Shah. The 25th Centenary Celebrations are a symbolic
                            assertion that Iran, under the leadership of the Shah, is assuming the
                            full promise of its ancient heritage. Your participation in these events
                            is intended to identify the United States with these accomplishments and
                            the Shah's leadership.</p>
                        <p>Most of your time will be spent participating in the various ceremonial
                            functions that have been planned. There probably will be little
                            opportunity for substantive discussions with other heads of
                            delegations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Meeting with the Shah</p>
                        <p>Since you will have only 10 to 15 minutes privately with the Shah, you
                            will want to limit, if possible, the number and type of substantive
                            topics.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Asia</p>
                        <p>This is the subject at the top of our priority list. The Shah has been a
                            generally moderating influence on President <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">Yahya</persName> of Pakistan during the present South Asian crisis.
                            He apparently is personally close to <persName>Yahya</persName> and we
                            would like to encourage the Shah to continue this effort.
                                <persName>Yahya</persName> will also be in Iran for the
                            celebrations. It would be desirable for you to impress on the Shah
                            that:</p>
                        <p>— We are deeply concerned that India and Pakistan could be approaching
                            the brink of war.</p>
                        <p>— We hope that the Shah, in every appropriate way, will continue to
                            counsel restraint recognizing that we have been making a maximum effort
                            to help <persName>Yahya</persName> work his way through <pb n="2" xml:id="d148-02" facs="d148-02"/>his difficulties in the face of
                            continuing Indian trouble-making. We have:</p>
                        <p>1) succeeded in getting a Consortium Agreement for a debt rescheduling
                            program</p>
                        <p>2) provided massive assistance to avert famine in East Pakistan;</p>
                        <p>3) at some cost, avoided open criticism of Pakistan while urging maximum
                            restraint in India.</p>
                        <p>— Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has
                            informed him that we are calling on both <persName>Yahya</persName> and
                            Mrs. GANDHI to withdraw their military forces from the immediate border
                            areas and cautioning them both about cross-border operations that could
                            provide the spark for a wider conflict. We would appreciate anything
                            that the Shah might also be able to do along these lines.</p>

                        <p>Iran has taken the position that it cannot vote for the continued seating
                            of the Republic of China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> though
                            it would not object to separate membership for "the Republic of
                            Formosa.” The Iranians have also said that they will abstain on our
                            Important Question Resolution and will vote for the Albanian Resolution
                            and against our Dual Representation Resolution. It would be helpful if
                            you could:</p>
                        <p>— Tell the Shah that even if we cannot agree on the substance of the
                            Chinese Representation issue, we cannot understand why Iran should
                            oppose us on the procedural aspects. Specifically, we believe Iran
                            should be able to vote with us to give the Important Question resolution
                            priority over the Albanian Resolution, to vote with us on the Important
                            Question resolution, and to at least abstain the Dual Representation
                            vote.</p>

                        <p>The British and the Iranians are engaged in a series of new talks over
                            the three islands in the mouth of the Gulf which the Iranians are
                            threatening to seize if they are not turned over to them by the end of

                            say:</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d148-03" facs="d148-03"/>
                        <p>— We are convinced that the British are making a genuine effort to
                            resolve the islands problem and hope that the Shah will work with them
                            to resolve the issue peacefully.</p>
                        <p>— Iranian seizure of the islands could have a destabilizing effect on the
                            Gulf and prevent cooperation between Iran and its Arab neighbors.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Aerial Tankers</p>
                        <p>The Shah has indicated that he will ask you about Iran acquiring aerial
                            tankers to refuel his F-4s. This request has been before us for some
                            time but the bureaucracy has been unable to come up with an agreed
                            position. The main issue is that the selling of such aircraft to Iran
                            might set a precedent that could provide problems with other countries.
                            This whole question is currently under active study by Defense and
                            State. There is, not much to say other than:</p>
                        <p>— You can assure him that question is under active study.</p>
                        <p>— We appreciate Iran's desire to be capable of defending itself and
                            intend to continue to help this effort through the provision of credit,
                            training and military advisory service.</p>

                        <p>1. DURING THE HOUR AND A QUARTER MEETING BETWEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT AID
                            THE SHAH ON OCTOBER 14, THE SHAH EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR US
                            COOPERATION IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND SAID THAT EVEN AFTER HIS PRESENT
                            FIVE-YEAR FORCE-GOAL PLAN HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IRAN WOULD STILL NEED THE
                            CONTINUED COOPERATION OF THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IN THE
                            MILITARY FIELD. WITH THE VIETNAM WAR BEING WOUND DOWN, HE HAD REQUESTED
                            US TO SUPPLY ABOUT 30 ADDITIONAL COMBAT EXPERIENCED ADVISORS FOR
                            ARMISH-MAAG AND HE HOPED WE WOULD ACQUIESCE TO THIS REQUEST. HE WOULD
                            ALSO WISH IN THE YEARS AHEAD TO GO ON SENDING IRANIAN OFFICERS TO THE US
                            FOR PILOT TRAINING IN ABOUT THE SAME NUMBERS AS PRESENTLY PROGRAMED
                            UNTIL IRAN'S AIRFORCE BUILDUP WAS COMPLETE. HE WOULD EVENTUALLY NEED NEW
                            AIRCRAFT TO MATCH THE CAPABILITIES OF THE MIG-25, BUT THIS WAS A LONGER
                            TERM PROPOSITTON.</p>
                        <p>2. HE ALSO NEEDED SOME AERIAL TANKERS BECAUSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IRAN
                            MUST DEVELOP AN "INDIAN OCEAN" POLICY IN THE LIGHT OF THE SOVIET UNION'S
                            INCREASING ACTIVITY IN THAT OCEAN AND ADJACENT WATERS. TO GIVE IRAN THE
                            NECESSARY CAPABILITY BEYOND <pb n="2" xml:id="d149-02" facs="d149-02"/>THE GULF OF OMAN AND INTO THE ARABIAN SEA AND INDIAN OCEAN, THE SHAH
                            HAD CONTEMPLATED ACQUIRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER FOR IRAN. HOWEVER, THIS
                            WOULD REQUIRE CRUISER AND DESTROYER ESCORTS, ETC., AND WOULD BE
                            HIDEOUSLY EXPENSIVE BOTH IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND TRAINED
                            PERSONNEL. THEREFORE THE SHAH HAD OPTED FOR OBTAINING AERIAL TANKERS
                            FROM THE US TO REFUUEL F-4'S WHICH COULD REACH OUT TOWARD THE INDIAN
                            OCEAN IF HIS F-4S HAD AN IN-FLIGHT REFUELING CAPABILITY.</p>
                        <p>3. IT WAS ALSO WITH THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING AN INDIAN OCEAN POLICY THAT
                            THE SHAH HAD INVITED THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA TO THE 2500TH
                            CENTENARY. SOME OF THE SHAH'S ADVISORS HAD OBJECTED BECAUSE IT MIGHT
                            ALIENATE MANY OF THE BLACK AFRICAN STATES. THE SHAH, HOWEVER, HAD
                            OVERRULED THEM, POINTING OUT THAT SOUTH AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA, WITH WHICH
                            HE IS ALSO STRENGTHENING HIS TIES, WERE ESSENTIAL FREE WORLD BASTIONS ON
                            BOTH FLANKS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN. THE SHAH CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT
                            CONTINUING MILITARY COOPERATION WITH US WAS OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE TO
                            IRAN AND ITS SECURITY.</p>
                        <p>4. HE THEN WENT ON TO SAY THAT IRAN MUST BE MILITARILY STRONG AND HAVE
                            ADEQUATE DETERRENT STRENGTH TO DISCOURAGE ANY ADVENTURES BY NEIGHBORS
                            SUCH AS THE RADICAL IRAQ REGIME. HE HAS ALSO LET THE SOVIET UNION KNOW
                            THAT IF ANY GREAT POWER, AND THIS MEANS RUSSIA, ATTACKS IRAN, IHE
                            IRANIAN AMRY WILL FIGHT TO THE END AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL FOLLOW A
                            SCORCHED-EARTH POLICY SO THAT THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT FOR THE
                            INVADING RUSSIANS THAT IS WORTH ANYTHING.</p>
                        <p>5. THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID WE WISHED TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN AND HELP IN
                            ALL FEASIBLE WAYS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE OUR PROBLEMS AND IT WAS BECOMING
                            INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO GET THE CONGRESS TO SUPPORT THE NECESSARY
                            APPROPRIATIONS FOR MILITARY AID AND ASSISTANCE. A DEFEAT FOR THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> ON THE CHIREP ISSUE WOULD ADD TO OUR
                            DIFFICULTIES. SHAH SAID IRAN IS NOT ASKING FOR GRANT ASSISTANCE BUT FOR
                            COOPERATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF CREDIT FOR THE PURCHASE OF
                            AMERICAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND FOR ASSISTANCE (<gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss>) IN TRAINING THE IRANIAN
                            FORCES. IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF ASKING FOR GRANT FUNDS, BUT SIMPLY FOR
                            CREDIT WHICH IRAN COULD OBTAIN COMMERCIALLY AT A SOMEWHAT HIGHER
                            INTEREST RATE SINCE IRAN'S INTERNATTONAL CREDIT IS GOOD. HE MENTIONED
                            THAT IF IRAN HAD SAUDI ARABIA'S OIL POTENTIAL THERE WOULD BE NO
                            FINANCIAL PROBLEM, AS THE SAUDIS HAD THE GREATEST PROVEN RESOURCE OIL
                            RESERVES IN THE WORLD, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN IRAN'S, ALTHOUGH
                            IRAN'S OIL RESOURCES HAD ONLY BEEN PARTIALLY EXPLORED.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d149-03" facs="d149-03"/>
                        <p>6. TURNING TO SAUDI ARABIA, SHAH SAID HE WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE
                            WEAKNESS OF THE SITUATION THERE. KING <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> MUST MOVE AHEAD MORE RAPIDLY WITH MORE REFORMS IF
                            HE IS NOT TO FIND HIMSELF IN SERIOUS TROUBLE AND THIS THE SHAH IS
                            CONTINUING TO URGE HIM TO DO. HOWEVER, IN SAUDI ARABIA, AS IN MORROCCO,
                            THERE IS RESISTANCE TO REFORM BY CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS AND THINGS ARE
                            MOVING MUCH TOO SLOWLY. THE SHAH SAID THAT IF SADAT SUCCEEDED IN GETTING
                            THE SOVIETS OUT OF EGYPT,SAuDI ARABIA WAS RIPE FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY,
                            IMPLYING THAT SAUDI ARABIA WOULD BE THE SOVIET'S NEXT TARGET.
                            NONETHELESS, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SHAH AND FAISAL WERE CLOSE AND
                            VERY GOOD, AND THE SHAH WILL CONTINUE TO USE HIS INFLUENCE IN FAVOR OG
                            MORE SEARCHING REFORMS BY <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. THE SHAH CONCLUDED BY AGAIN STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE HE ATTACHES TO
                            MILITARY COOPERATION BY THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND HIS
                            HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE RESPONSIVE TO HIS REQUESTS, PARTICULARLY SINCVE,
                            WITH THE BRITISH LEAVING THE GULF, THE WHOLE BURDEN OF PROTECTING THE
                            FREE WORLD'S VITAL PETROLEUM INTERESTS IN THE GULF WILL FALL ON IRAN'S
                            SHOULDERS. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IF THE GULF FALLS
                            INTO UNFRIENDLY HANDS THAT WISH TO USE OIL AS A WEAPON OF POLITICAL
                            COERCION AGAINST THE WEST, THEN THE COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE WOULD
                            ONLY HAVE THE ALTERNATIVE OF (A) ACCEDING TO SUCH PRESSURE OR (B) SEEING
                            THEIR INDUSTRIES SHUT DOWN AND THEIR ECONOMIES DETERIORATE, OR (C) USING
                            FORCE AGAINST THE UNFRIENDLY POWER OR POWERS THAT HAD SEIZED THE GULF.
                            HE WAS QUITE CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THE WESTERN NATIONS WOULD BE
                            OBLIGED TO RESORT TO FORCE RATHER THAN TO SEE THEIR ECONOMIES GRIND TO A
                            HALT. HOWEVER, A MILITARILY STRONG IRAN COULD SAFFGUAR THE VITAL
                            INTERESTS OF THE WEST IN THE PERSIAN GULF WITHOUT THE WESTERN POWERS
                            HAVING TO INTERVENE.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Iranian <gloss target="#t_ConGen1">ConGen</gloss> San Francisco was
                            bombed October 14 at 11:30 p.m. Although no one was hurt, <gloss target="#t_ConGen1">ConGen</gloss>'s wife and children were in
                            building when bomb went off. Very large amount of plastic explosive was
                            used (equiv. 120 sticks of dynamite, four times larger than Capitol
                            bomb), causing extensive fire damage to building and totally wrecking
                            garage and <gloss target="#t_ConGen1">ConGen</gloss>'s car. Many windows
                            in adjacent buildings shattered. Damage estimated at $500,000-$900,000,
                            but could change in either direction. Mayor of San Francisco immediately
                            made arrangements for all ConGen personnel to move into hotel.</p>
                        <p>2. Suspect was apprehended immediately after explosion; does not appear
                            to be Iranian, however. Name: Kent Stephen Wells. FBI and Secret Service
                            have no record of him as yet. SY is running name check; we will advise
                            if anything further turns up.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d150-02" facs="d150-02"/>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> has arranged for additional
                            protection for other Iranian official premises in US. This will include
                            seven-man detail at Embassy where demonstration expected today and
                            two-man detail over weekend. Embassy has received bomb threat by phone
                            but EPS has so far found nothing.</p>
                        <p>4. In possibly related development, the Iran Student Association
                            headquarters in Washington was subjected to very extensive fire damage
                            ten p.m. October 14, or seven p.m. San Francisco time. The first
                            presumption was that somebody was making a bomb and it went off
                            prematurely. Although this is a possibility, the Metropolitan Police
                            tend to discount it since no bodies or evidence of personal injuries
                            were found. Metropolitan Police are operating on hypothesis <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> fire could have been caused either by
                                <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> or by local Organization of
                            Arab Students, with whom <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> have
                            apparently been feuding in recent weeks. <pb n="3" xml:id="d150-03" facs="d150-03"/>Nevertheless, if <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>
                            in San Francisco jumped to conclusion DC fire was <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s work, they had four hours to
                            organize riposte against <gloss target="#t_ConGen1">ConGen</gloss>.</p>

                            to do their utmost to apprehend those responsible for San Francisco
                            incident. Vice President may wish to make parallel representations to

                        </list>
                        <p>Reference is made to our memorandum I-25,305/71, dated 12 July 1971,
                            subject: <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> Defense Capability for the
                            Imperial Iranian Air Force, and your memorandum DJSM-1007/71, dated 26
                            August 1971, same subject.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has agreed to send a team to Iran
                            to brief the Shah as well as representatives of the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> on the various aspects of the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> study appended to the above
                            referenced CJSM.</p>
                        <p>I therefore request that a team be assembled to brief the Shah and the
                                <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> on the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> Defense Capability Study so that the Government of Iran
                            may analyze the alternatives and arrive at the best course of action for
                            the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> to acquire an anti-<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> capability. The ambassador recommends
                            that the team chief be at least a full colonel. In addition to the team
                            chief, I believe, as a minimum, that two other officers should be
                            selected, one who has expertise in tactics and use of electronic
                            countermeasures along with the necessary hardware and the radar homing
                            and warning systems. The other member of the briefing team should be a
                            fighter pilot with expertise in SHRIKE delivery and be able to answer
                            technical questions from a fighter pilot's point of view. It would be
                            helpful if the officers selected have knowledge of the SHRIKE programs
                            in Israel.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we have agreed to augment this team with an officer who is
                            highly qualified to brief the Shah and the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> on aerial refueling. We anticipate that the Vice
                            President will tell the Shah we have approved in principle Iran's
                            acquisition of an aerial refueling capability. We have also made it
                            clear that there are no refueling aircraft available from <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> inventory but that Iran could procure
                            from US commercial sources a conversion of the Boeing 707 type to an
                            aerial tanker.</p>
                        <p>The briefing team should be prepared to depart for Iran by mid-November.
                            Specific guidance will be provided to the team by the Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary for Near Eastern, African, and South Asian Affairs. I also
                            want to meet with the team chief prior to his departure. Project officer
                            in NESA Region is LTC William A. Starker, extension 5-9856.</p>

                        <p>THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE<lb/> WASHINGTON<lb/> November 11, 1971</p>
                        <p>Dear Dave:</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEW1">Williamson</persName>, Chief, <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss>, Iran, has recommended
                            with the strong endorsement of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            Technical Assistance Field Team (<gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss>)
                            in Iran be continued to July 1974, although at a level of 43, reduced
                            from the present 80. We support this recommendation and urge that an
                            early affirmative decision be made to this effect.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of continuing <gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss> personnel
                            in Iran until July 1974 is to enable the Imperial Iranian Air Force to
                            activate efficiently and effectively two additional squadrons of F-4
                            aircraft it has purchased from the United States which will be delivered
                            over the next three years. These additional aircraft will bring to a
                            total of eight the number of F-4 squadrons Iran has acquired from the
                            United States at a cost of nearly $550 million. In our view the addition
                            of these aircraft will enhance Iran's deterrent and defense capability
                            and help assure peace and stability in the vitally important Persian
                            Gulf and Indian Ocean areas, thus serving United States and free world
                            interests directly. We feel our assistance in this respect is an
                            excellent example of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            Doctrine in operation. As you know the services of these personnel are
                            financed by the Iranians. In addition, our support through <gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss> will doubtless contribute to the
                            maintenance of the excellent relations and <pb n="2" xml:id="d152-02" facs="d152-02"/>good will we enjoy in Iran and permit us to continue
                            to count on the many privileges, including overflight rights in the
                            vitally important East-West Turkey-Iran corridor, we now have. The value

                            with the activation of previous F-4 purchases has been well established.
                            We believe there is every reason to conclude that their continuation
                            would assure the successful activation of Iran's additional
                            purchases.</p>

                        <p>The British decision to terminate the protective treaty relationship with
                            the lower Gulf shaykhdoms has now been fully implemented. While the Gulf
                            will continue to present its share of problems, the statesmanship
                            demonstrated to date by the principal parties concerned augurs well for
                            the future evolution of that important region. The independent states of
                            Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have emerged, enjoying
                            United Nations and Arab League membership and the recognition of most
                            countries interested in the area including the United States. Ras
                            al-Khaimah has not yet joined the United Arab Emirates but is likely to
                            do so in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Successful implementation of the British decision involved dealing with
                            several longstanding and difficult territorial problems: Iran's claim to
                            Bahrain, the dispute between Iran and two Trucial States over three
                            small Gulf islands, and the Saudi boundary dispute with Abu Dhabi. Iran
                            relinquished its claim to Bahrain in the spring of 1970. The dispute
                            over the islands of Tunbs and Abu Musa was resolved as the Trucial
                            States became independent, through</p>
                        <p>a) agreement between Iran and Sharjah with respect to the largest island,
                            Abu Musa, and</p>
                        <p>b) Iranian occupation of the sparsely populated Tunbs, with the knowledge
                            but not the acquiescence of the Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d153-02" facs="d153-02"/>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia is withholding recognition of the United Arab Emirates
                            pending solution of its boundary dispute with Abu Dhabi, but there are
                            indications this problem will be resolved in an atmosphere of
                            friendship.</p>
                        <p>There has been considerable verbal Arab reaction to the Iranian
                            occupation of the Tunbs. Iraq broke relations with Iran and the United
                            Kingdom over this issue, and the Qadhafi regime used it as a pretext for
                            nationalizing British Petroleum interests in Libya. On balance, however,
                            the transition in the Gulf has taken place in a manner permitting a
                            continuing British role in support of the security of the region and
                            offering reasonably good prospects for the stability of the newly
                            independent political entities.</p>
                        <p>In these developments we have played a supporting role in close
                            consultation with the British, encouraging their efforts to resolve the
                            problems of withdrawal while urging Iran and the Arab states concerned
                            to approach these problems in a cooperative and flexible manner. As the
                            difficult transitional period in the Gulf ends, Anglo-American
                            cooperation in the area remains unimpaired as do our relations with the
                            littoral states. We are proceeding to implement your decision to extend
                            our diplomatic representation to the newly independent states. We are
                            also negotiating with Bahrain stationing arrangements to permit the
                            continued presence of the U.S. Navy's Middle East Force in the Persian
                            Gulf and Indian Ocean.</p>

                            BURCHINAL OF EUCOM, SHAH REVIEWED NEW STRATEGIC SITUATION DEVELOPING IN
                            MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA, STATED THIS MAKES IMPERATIVE CONTINUED
                            MODERNIZATION AND BUILD-UP OF IRANIAN DEFENSE FORCES, AND THEN OUTLINED
                            PROJECTION OF LONG TERM IRANIAN AIR-FORCE STRUCTURE AFTER 1975. HE AGAIN
                            STATED DESIRE PURCHASE 3 SQAUDRONS OF F-15S (IF LATTER SELECTED FOR

                            FIRST DISCUSSED WITH SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">LAIRD</persName> IN OCTOBER 1969. HE EXPRESSED HOPE THERE WOULD NO
                            DIFFICULTIES IN ACQUIRING F-15S (IF AND WHEN AVAILABLE) BUT MADE CLEAR
                            HE MUST HAVE NEXT GENERATION AIRCRAFT EVEN IF NECESSARY PURCHASE THEM
                            ELSEWHERE (MENTIONING APPROACHES BY FRENCH AND BRITISH-GERMAN

                        <p>SHAH ALSO EXPRESSED HOPE, IN LIGHT PLANS FOR INCREASED AIR FORCE, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> COULD CONTINUE TRAIN 150 PILOTS EACH IN
                            FY 75 AND 76, WITH GRADUAL PHASE-DOWN BEGINNING <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 77. RE TRAINING OF IRANIAN AIR FORCE, THERE WAS INFORMAL

                        <p>2. ON DEC 21 AMBASSADOR PRESENTED TO SHAH GENERAL BURCHINAL (<gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss>), TO WHOSE COMMAND <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
                            AFTER JANUARY 1, 1972: BRIG GEN PRICE, ACTING A/M CHIEF, WAS ALSO
                            PRESENT. AUDIENCE LASTED ONE HOUR AND QUARTER, DURING WHICH SHAH GAVE IN
                            DETAIL HIS ESTIMATE OF STRATEGIC SITUATION IN THIS PART OF WORLD AND
                            INCREASING POTENTIAL THREAT WHICH IRAN AND OTHER NATIONS FRIENDLY TO
                            WEST FACE AS RESULT OF EXPANSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE OVER PAST SEVEN
                            MONTHS. HE POINTED OUT THAT NOT ONLY HAD SOVIET UNION SUBSTANTIALLY
                            INCREASED ITS PRESENCE AND INFLUENCE, IN MID-EAST -SOUTH ASIA AREA AS
                            RESULT OF SOVIET- EGYPTIAN AND SOIVET-INDIAN PACTS, BUT THAT PARALLEL
                            WITH THIS DISTURBING EXPANSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE, IRAQ HAD RECEIVED
                            VISIT OF EAST GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER AND MOST RECENTLY SOVIET DEFENSE
                            MINISTER GRECHKO, WHO HAD STATED PUBLICLY NOT ONLY THAT SOVIETS AND IRAQ
                            HAD TOTAL IDENTITY OF VIEWS ON ALL SUBJECTS BUT ALSO THAT SOVIETS WOULD
                            ASSIST IRAQ IN FURTHER STRENGTHENING ITS ARMED FORCES. "WHO ARE THEY
                            STRENGTHENING THEM AGAINST?" HE ASKED, MENTIONING THE WEAKNESS OF SOME
                            OF THE MODERATE GULF STATES AND THE VITAL IMPORTANCE TO JAPAN AND THE
                            WEST OF PERSIAN GULF OIL. SIMILARLY, EARLIER VISIT OF EAST GERMAN
                            DEFENSE MINISTER HAD ALSO OBVIOUSLY BEEN DESIGNED TO FURTHER ASSIST
                            IRAQI ARMED FORCES SINCE EAST GERMANY HAS MILITARY TRAINING MISSION IN
                            IRAQ.</p>
                        <p>3. SHAH SAID THIS SITUATION, COUPLED WITH AFGHANISTAN'S UTTER WEAKNESS
                            AND PAKISTAN DEFEAT WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN VERY UNSTABLE AND DANGERIOUS
                            SITUATION ON IRAN'S EASTERN FRONTIER, IN ADDITION TO IRAQI THREAT ON
                            WEST, MADE IT IMPERATIVE THAT IRAN GO AHEAD WITH FURTHER BUILD-UP OF ITS
                            FORCES SINCE IRAN'S GREATEST DETERRENT WAS TO HAVE FORCES OF SUCH
                            STRENGTH THAT ANY UNFRIENDLY NEIGHBORS THAT MIGHT BE ENCOURAGED TO
                            UNDERTAKE ADVENTURE AGAINST IRAN WOULD KNOW BEFOREHAND THAT THEY COULD
                            BE SMASHED.</p>
                        <p>4. IN FIRST INSTANCE SHAH GAVE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO HIS AIR FORCE AND ITS
                            LONG TERM BUILD-UP, STRESSING HE WANTED IT <pb n="3" xml:id="d154-03" facs="d154-03"/>TO CONTINUE TO BE AMERICAN EQUIPPED AND TRAINED. HE
                            SAID DEVELOPMENT OF HIS AIR FORCE IS PROGRESSING VERY SATISFACTORILY AND
                            EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR OUR COOPERATION, WHICH HAD MADE THIS
                            POSSIBLE. AS TO LONG TERM FUTURE, HE WANTED TO LET US KNOW
                            CONFIDENTIALLY THAT IN POST-I975 PERIOD, <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FORCE STRUCTURE IS TENTATIVELY BEING
                            PROJECTED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                        <p>8 SQDNS OF F-4D/E AIRCRAFT</p>
                        <p>2 SQDNS OF F-5E AIRCRAFT</p>
                        <p>6 SQDNS OF P-530 TYPE AIRCRAFT OR F-5E IF P-5J30 TYPE NOT DEVELOPED</p>
                        <p>3 SQDNS OF F-15 AIRCRAFT</p>
                        <p>HE ALSO SAID HE PLANNED TO DEVELOP AIR REFUELING CAPAPILITY USING DC-8 OP
                            707 AIRCRAFT AND PLANNED ACQUIRE P-3C LONG RANGE NAVAL SURVEILLANCE
                            AIRCRAFT.</p>
                        <p>5. SHAH REFERRED TO HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH DEFENSE SECRETARY AJAIRD IN
                            WASHINGTON AT BLAIR HOUSE IN 1969 WHEN SHAH HAD FIRST DISCUSSED HIS
                            DESIRE TO EVENTUALLY PURCHASE F-15 AIRCRAFT FROM US. HE RECOGNIZED THIS
                            AIRCRAFT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE BUT WANTED US TO KNOW THAT IF
                            IT IS SELECTED FOR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION BY <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, HE WANTS PLACE ORDER FOR THREE SQONS OF THIS NEXT
                            GENERATION AIRCRAFT. HE HOPED MOST EARNESTLYTHAT THERE. WOULD BE NO
                            DIFFICULTIES AND SAID THAT A) WHILE FRENCH HAD BEEN DISCUSSING WITH
                            IRANIAN MILITARY DESIRABILITY OF PURCHASING THE PROPOSED MIRAGE G-8
                            AIRCRAFT WHICH WILL BE ABOUT MACH 2#31/2, AND B) THERE HAD ALSO BEEN
                            DISCUSSIONS WITH BRITISH-GERMAN GROUP, WHICH IS TRYING TO DEVELOP A NEXT
                            GENERATION AIRCRAFT, HE WANTED F-15 AS HE WISHED TO KEEP HIS AIR FORCE
                            COMPLETELY US EQUIPPED. FURTHERMORE, IF HE COULD PLACE ORDER AT SAME
                            TIME AS WE PLACED ORDERS FOR MASS PRODUCTION, IT SHOULD HELP IN KEEPING
                            COST DOWN. HE ASSUMED THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM BUT DID WANT US TO KNOW
                            THAT HE MUST HAVE NEXT GENERATION AIRCRAFT AND WOULD PURCHASE ONE COME
                            WHAT MAY.</p>
                        <p>6. IN LIGHT OF ABOVE PLANS FOR POST-1975 AIRCRAFT INCREASES, <pb n="4" xml:id="d154-04" facs="d154-04"/>HE ALSO HOPED WE WOULD CONTINUE TO
                            BE ABLE TO TRAIN 150 PILOTS EACH IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75
                            AND <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-76. IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-77 AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEREAFTER NUMBER OF TRAINING
                            SLOTS COULD GRADUALLY BE PHASED DOWN AND OUT AS HE PLANNED EVENTUALLY TO
                            HAVE HIS OWN AIR FORCE SCHOOL. SHAH HAD THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO
                            ESTABLISH PILOT TRAINING SCHOOL IN NEXT YEAR OR SO BUT, GIVEN NATURE OF
                            THREAT IN THIS AREA WHICH HAS SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED AS RESULT OF
                            RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAD HAD EXPLAINED ABOVE, HE COULD NOT TRANSFER
                            HIS BEST PILOTS FROM HIS F-4 SQDNS TO TRAINING AS INSTRUCTORS WITHOUT
                            DESTROYING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PRESENT AIR FORCE. HE REALIZED FROM
                            DISCUSSION WITH AMBASSADOR THAT WE COULD NOT GIVE FIRM COMMITMENT FOR
                            150 PILOT TRAINING SLOTS FOR EACH YEAR THROUGH <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-7A, BUT HE DID WANT US TO KNOW THAT THIS WHAT HE HAS IN
                            MIND AND WHAT HE WOULD REQUEST.</p>
                        <p>7. IN CONNECTION WITH PRESENT TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF IRANIAN PILOTS,
                            THERE WAS BRIEF INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF POSSIBILITY OF (A) FEW USAFF
                            PILOTS VISITING IRAN FOR BRIEF PERIOD TO FLY WITH IRANIAN F-4 PILOTS
                            FROM TIME TO TIME IN IRANIAN AIRCRAFT WITH STATUS AS SPECIAL TRAINING
                            MISSION UNDER <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> AND
                            CONVERSELY, OF IRANIAN PILOTS VISITING USAFE SQDNS IN <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss>, OR (B) SOME JOINT US-IRAN (AND
                            POSSIBLY TURK) JOINT AERIAL EXERCISES UNDER <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> RUBRIC. GENERAL BURCHINAL UNDERTOOK TO LOOK INTO
                            THESE POSSIBILITIES UPON HIS RETURN TO HIS HEADQUARTERS.</p>
                        <p>8. SHAH ALSO DISCUSSED BRIEFLY PLANS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HIS GROUND AND
                            NAVAL FORCES SAYING HIS OBJECTIVE IS MODERATE SIZED BUT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
                            MOBILE AND WELL EQUIPPED FORCES. AS CONTRASTED WITH AIR FORCE, WHICH IS
                            VIRTUALLY ENTIRELY US EQUIPPED, HIS ARMY AND NAVY HAVE MIX OF EQUIPMENT
                            FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. HE PLANS TO HAVE MOBILE GROUND FORCES WITH
                            STRONG ARMOR SUPPRTED BY THEIR OWN HELICOPTER FORCE ARMED WITH TOW
                            MISSILES FOR ANTI-TANK OPERATIONS. HIS NAVY WILL HAVE SOME CAPABILITY IN
                            GULF OF OMAN AND ARABIAN SEA, AS WELL AS PERSIAN GULF, AND WILL RE
                            EQUIPPED WITH SURFACE- TO SURFACE MISSILES. (HE MENTIONED INDIAN NAVY
                            HAD DESTROYED PAKI VESSELS WITH NAVAL MISSILES).</p>

                        <p>I. SUMMARY: IN CONVERSATIONS WITH AMBASSADOR AND DAVID BARRAN OF SHELL,
                            SHAH HAS DECLARED THAT CONSORTIUM MUST PREPARE NOW FOR EXTENSIVE CHANGES
                            IN RELATIONSHIP WITH <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> BY 1979. OF
                            SEVERAL OPTIONS HE PRESENTED, SHAH PREFERS JOINT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-CONSORTIUM PARTICIPATION IN PRODUCTION IN IRAN AND
                            DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES BOTH IN IRAN AND ABROAD. IN MEANTIME EXPORT AND
                            PRODUCTION FACILITIES MUST BE EXPANDED. SHAH AND CONSORTIUM <gloss target="#t_Rep1">REP</gloss>S WILL MEET TEHRAN OR ST. MORITZ EARLY
                            FEBRUARY TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. ON DEC 21 SHAH INFORMED ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> IS INITIATING TALKS WITH OIL CONSORTIUM REGARDING
                            CONSORTIUM SITUATION AFTER 1979 WHEN, HE SAID, THEIR RIGHTS WILL
                            TERMINATE. HE SAID HE IS LETTING CONSORTIUM MEMBERS KNOW THAT IF THEY
                            WISH TO CONTINUE ON ANYTHING APPROACHING PRESENT BASIS AFTER 1979. THEY
                            MUST BEGIN NOW RPT NOW TO HAMMER OUT AGREEMENT AND NOT RPT NOT POSTPONE
                            CONSIDERATION OF POST-1979 SITUATION TILL LATER.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d155-02" facs="d155-02"/>
                        <p>3. SHAH SAID HE HAS CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS AND DEMANDS RE POST-1979 WHICH
                            HE WILL PUT TO CONSORTIUM. HE INDICATED AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT OF
                            THESE WAS THAT AFTER THAT DATE IRAN WOULD NOT TOLERATE ANY MEMBER WITH A
                            13 1/2 PER CENT INTEREST BEING ABLE TO HAVE VETO OVER OTHER MEMBERS OF
                            CONSORTIUM ON WHAT MUST BE DONE TO MEET IRAN'S LEGITIMATE REQUIREMENTS
                            (THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT HE WAS REFERRING AMONG OTHER THINGS TO
                            PRODUCTION, OFF-TAKE, ETC.). HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY OF CONSORTIUM
                            COMPANIES " HAVE A STRONGER LOVE AFFAIR ELSEWHERE" AND DON'T WANT TO DO
                            WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR IRAN, THEN LET THEM GO ELSEWHERE AND BE REPLACED BY
                            OTHER FOREIGN COMPANIES WHO WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO
                            COME IN AND OPERATE IN IRAN ON MUTUALLY SATSFACTORY TERMS.</p>
                        <p>4. WHILE NOT GOING INTO FURTHER DETAIL, WE SAID CONSORTIUM COMPANIES
                            COULD NOT MEET HIS POST-1979 REQUIREMENTS, THEY WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE TWO
                            OPTIONS OPEN TO THEM: (A) TO SHARE PARTICIPATION ON FIFTY-FIFTY BASIS
                            WITH IRAN DISPOSING OF ITS SHARE AS IT SAW FIT: OR (B) SIMPLY BECOMING
                            MARKETER OF OIL THAT IRAN WOULD SUPPLY. SHAH SAID HE PERSONALLY HOPED IT
                            WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH COMPANIES IN FORTHCOMING
                            PERIOD AS HE FELT ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE WORKED OUT FOR POST-1979 PERIOD
                            THAT WOULD BE MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY AND SERVE INTERESTS OF BOTH PARTIES
                            AND WITH WHICH BOTH COMPANIES AND IRAN COULD LIVE.</p>
                        <p>5. I COMMENTED THAT IN VIEW OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROBLEM AND
                            COMPLEXITY INVOLVED, I HOPED IT WOULD BE HANDLED MOST CAREFULLY WITH
                            LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF ALL PARTIES TAKEN FULLY INTO CONSIDERATION.
                            OTHERWISE IT OBVIOUSLY COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD AFFECT ADVERSELY
                            INTERESTS OF OIL COMPANIES AND THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN AS WELL AS
                            THOSE OF IRAN.</p>
                        <p>6. IN SEPARATE AND LATER CONVERSATION WITH ECONCOUSELOR, <persName corresp="#p_VRJ1">JAN VAN REEVEN</persName>, MANAGING DIRECTOR
                            CONSORTIUM (PROTECT) DESCRIBED FAREWELL CALL PAID BY DAVID BARRAN ON
                            SHAH BEFORE FORMER'S RETIREMENT AS CHAIRMAN OF SHELL. ACCOUNT <pb n="3" xml:id="d155-03" facs="d155-03"/>PROVIDED GLOSS ON SEVERAL OF SHAH'S
                            POINTS TO AMBASSADOR.</p>
                        <p>7. AFTER WIDE RANGING REVIEW OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN AREA,
                            SHAH MENTIONED THAT CONSORTIUM AGREEMENTS ENDS IN 1979 AND SAID NOW IS
                            TIME FOR MEMBERS AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WORK OUT FUTURE
                            RELATIONS FOR POST 1979 PERIOD. SHAH REQUIRED CLEAR INDICATION OF
                            CONSORTIUM PLANS FOR INCREASING EXPORT CAPACITY AND OFFTAKE OVER NEXT
                            SIX YEARS I.E. FINAL YEAR FOURTH PLAN AND COMPLETE FIFTH PLAN. SHAH
                            NOTED THAT COMPLETELY SATISFACTORY ARRANGEMENT NECESSARY IF MEMBERS
                            EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN FUTURE POSITION IN IRAN. (VAN REEVEN COMMENTED THAT
                            ALTHOUGH NO SPECIFIC EXPORT GOALS SET BY SHAH, THAT OTHER SOURCES HAVE
                            INDICATED <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> EXPECTS EXPORT CAPACITY TO
                            BE INCREASED TO 8 MILLION BPD BY 1977.)</p>
                        <p>8. CONCERNING POSSIBLE FUTURE JOINT ARRANGEMENTS, SHAH SAID HE NOT <gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> NOT INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATION ON
                            TERMS PROPOSED BY RECENT <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            RESOLUTION BUT SUGGESTED THAT MEMBERS START THINKING, ABOUT POSSIBLE
                            DOWNSTREAM JOINT VENTURES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS WITH IRAN. BARRAN REMINDED
                            SHAH THAT OPERATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE UNDERTAKEN NOT BY CONSORTIUM
                            AS SUCH BUT RATHER BY ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. SHAH ADMITTED THIS BUT
                            SAID HE ALSO INTERESTED IN A NEW EXPORT ORIENTED REFINERY WITHIN IRAN AT
                            A LOCATION CONSIDERABLY REMOVED FROM THE PRESENT ABADAN REFINERY.</p>
                        <p>9. SHAH NOTED THAT AFTER 1979 SEVERAL OPTIONS ARE OPEN TO IRAN. AMONG
                            THEM: (A) IRAN TO TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OF ITS OIL PRODUCTION AND SIMPLY
                            SELL IT TO THE COMPANIES AT PIER'S END. THIS APPROACH MIGHT WORK OUT
                            SATISFACTORILY IF COMPANIES DO NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST IRAN OR, ON THE
                            OTHER HAND, IRAN DID NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ONE OR ANOTHER COMPANY.
                            THIS IS LEAST SATISFACTORY SOLUTION IN THE SHAH'S VIEW. (B) IRAN COULD
                            TAKE OVER WP50 PER CENT SHARE IN THE CONSORTIUM. NIOC WOULD MARKET ITS
                            SHARE OF CONSORTIUM OIL IN COMPETITION WITH CONSORTIUM MEMBERS. THIS TOO
                            HAS ITS DRAWBACKS SINCE PROBABLY THE NIOC COULD NOT MARKET SUCH LARGE
                            QUANTITIES SUCCESSFULLY AND CONSORTIUM WOULD HAVE TO SELL MOST OF IRAN'S
                            SHARE. (C) COMPANIES COULD CONTINUE PRESENT <pb n="4" xml:id="d155-04" facs="d155-04"/>ARRANGEMENTS IN A SLIGHTLY REVISED MANNER BY
                            INCLUDING THE NIOC IN DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS EITHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE
                            COUNTRY, AND BY PROVIDING AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE REVENUES FOR THE
                            GOVERNMENT OF IRAN. IN ANY CASE, THE SHAH ADDED, IRAN WOULD NO LONGER
                            TOLERATE A SITATUATION WHEREBY MEMBERS CONTROLLING LESS THAN 14 PER CENT
                            OF THE CONSORTIUM CAN FRUSTRATE ACTIONS OF BENEFIT TO IRAN.</p>
                        <p>10. SHAH REQUESTED A SPECIFIED ANNUAL AMOUNT OF COST OIL TO MARKET ON ITS
                            OWN. HE NOTED THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IRAN WOULD NEED OIL FOR
                            POSSIBLE SALES AGREEMENTS CURRENTLY UNDER DISCUSSION WITH CITIES SERVICE
                            AND ASHLAND OIL OF THE UNITED STATES. NO QUANTITIES MENTIONED.</p>
                        <p>11. LATER THE SHAH INSTRUCTED PARVIZ MINA TO CALL BARRAN TO TELL HIM SHAH
                            HAD FORGOTTEN TO RAISE QUESTION RE-INJECTION OF ASSOCIATED GAS (NOW
                            FLARED) INTO RESERVOIRS AS A CONSERVATION MEASURE. THIS IS A SUBJECT
                            WHICH THE CONSORTIUM HAS MANAGED TO EVADE OVER THE YEARS AND VAN REEVEN
                            REPORTED THAT BARRAN WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT THE SHAH SHOULD RAISE
                            IT. (WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE WAS SURPRISED IN VIEW OF PUBLICITY RE
                            RE-INJECTION AS ESSENTIAL CONSERVATION MEASURE.)</p>
                        <p>12. AS BACKGROUND TO ABOVE, SHAW'S WISHES CONCERNING POST 1979
                            ARRANGEMENTS WERE RAISED BY EGHBAL IN LAST OCTOBER LONDON TALKS. MEMBERS
                            HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THEIR PROJECTIONS THROUGH 1976 ALMOST DAY AND NIGHT
                            SINCE THAT TIME AND HAD PLANNED SEND HIGH-LEVEL TEAM TO IRAN IN
                            MID-JANUARY TO INFORM SHAH OF RESULTS THESE DELIBERATIONS. SINCE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> WILL MEET IN GENEVA IN MID-JANUARY,
                            SHAH HAS TOLD MEMBERS TO MEET HIM IN EARLY FEBRUARY EITHER IN TEHRAN OR
                            SAN MORITZ, DEPENDING ON WHETHER HE CAN DEPART FOR HIS ANNUAL WINTER
                            HOLIDAY MORE OR LESS ON SCHEDULE. THE SHAH SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THAT
                            HE PREFERRED NOT TO MEET AT ZURICH BECAUSE OF THE UNHAPPY MEMORIES HE
                            HAD AT THE PREVIOUS MEETING WITH MEMBERS THERE IN EARLY 1969.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> (attached)
                            strongly recommends you try to include Iran in your foreign
                            travels—notably in connection with your trip to Moscow—or make some
                            alternative arrangement to see the Shah. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> returned here last month
                            with word that the Shah is still counting on your promise to visit him
                            this term in office as you told him in 1969 and reaffirmed this year.
                            Last week Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>
                            approached me to express the Shah's hope you will be coming. I was
                            sympathetic in expressing your deep interest in Iran but was
                            noncommittal on the precise question of a visit or its timing.</p>
                        <p>There are two aspects of the Shah's interest. One, of course, is his
                            special relationship with you and his great sensitivity and pride in not
                            being overlooked, especially in view of the fact that you are meeting
                            with other major leaders in connection with your Peking/Moscow travels.
                            On the substantive side, he has overriding concerns about long-range
                            Soviet objectives in the area, including the Persian Gulf and Indian
                            subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>I am sending this to you just to inform you that the Shah has raised this
                            question again. You will probably need to wait until nearer the time to
                            see what competing invitations you have. While I had my doubts
                            previously I now believe that with the momentous developments in South
                            Asia and the potential in the Mid East, a visit to Iran is a serious
                            proposition.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> has
                            reported that the Shah of Iran is counting upon you to keep the
                            commitment you made in 1969, and reaffirmed in 1971, to visit Iran
                            during your present term in office. The Shah is a proud and sensitive
                            man; in the light of your visits to Moscow and Peking, and of your
                            upcoming meetings with at least five other heads of state and
                            government, I believe we are headed for serious trouble if you do not
                            also visit Iran or make some other arrangement to meet the Shah
                            soon.</p>
                        <p>The Shah remains apprehensive of Soviet Union long-range designs upon
                            Iran and the Persian Gulf. He feels encircled by the Soviet penetration
                            of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. A visit by you to Tehran
                            or at least a meeting with the Shah would help meet an outstanding
                            commitment, and also serve to reaffirm the importance of our interest in
                            a strong, friendly, and independent Iran. I therefore strongly recommend
                            that you add Tehran to your travel itinerary, for example in connection
                            with your Moscow trip, or make some other arrangement to meet with the
                            Shah.</p>

                            AND HAD RE-AFFIRMED IT IN APRIL 1971. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> ALSO MENTIONED AN ARTICLE HE SAID WAS IN NEW
                            YORK TIMES THAT US WAS BUILDING BRIDGES TO NEW FRIENDS (CHINA) AND
                            TEARING DOWN BRIDGES TO OLD FRIENDS AND REMARKED SARDONICALLY THAT THERE
                            HAD BEEN NO WORD ABOUT HIS OWN VISIT TO WASHINGTON IN JANUARY (THIS WAS
                            BEFORE <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">HOVEYDA</persName> CANCELLED VISIT
                            ALLEGEDLY BECAUSE OF IRAQ CRISIS).</p>
                        <p>YESTERDAY WHEN SENATOR SYMINGTON AND I WERE RECEIVED BY SHAH, SYMINGTON
                            COMMENTED AT END OF MEETING THAT HE HOPED TO SEE SHAH IN US IN NOT
                            DISTANT FUTURE. SHAH REPLIED STONILY THAT HE HAD VISITED US GREAT MANY
                            TIMES AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS "PERHAPS TIME FOR SOMEONE FROM OVER THERE TO
                            VISIT IRAN.”</p>
                        <p>IN LIGHT OF THIS BACKGROUND, TEXT OF MESSAGE TO SHAH GIVES ME DEEP
                            CONCERN, PARTICULARLY STATEMENT PRESIDENT REGRETS HE NOT ABLE TO
                            INDICATE "WHETHER" A VISIT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. THE WORD "WHETHER" RAISES
                            FOR FIRST TIME DOUBT THAT PRESIDENT WILL FULFILL COMMITMENT HE GAVE SHAH
                            MORE THAN TWO YEARS <pb n="2" xml:id="d157-02" facs="d157-02"/>AGO WHICH
                            WAS REAFFIRMED LAST APRIL. I THINK PROPOSED MESSAGE IN <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss> WILL BE INTERPRETED AS WALKING
                            AWAY FROM THIS COMMITMENT AND WILL NOT ONLY BE RESENTED BUT WILL DEEPEN
                            SUSPICIONS THAT ARE DEVELOPING IN MIND OF SHAH, WHO IS PROUD AND
                            SENSITIVE MAN, THAT WE REALLY DO NOT REGARD HIM OR IRAN AS VERY
                            IMPORTANT. IF THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT COME, I FEAR THAT THE BASIC
                            STRUCTURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF CONFIDENCE AND COOPERATION WHICH WE
                            HAVE BUILT UP SO PAINSTAKINGLY WITH IRAN AND WHICH SERVES OUR NATIONAL
                            INTEREST SO WELL, COULD BEGIN TO ERODE AWAY. AND IRAN, AS WE ALL KNOW,
                            IS THE ONE REALLY STABLE, DEPENDABLE AND AT SAME TIME FRIENDLY BUILDING
                            BLOCK WE HAVE TO WORK WITH BETWEEN JAPAN AND <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> EUROPE. IT IS A KEYSTONE FOR US IN AN AREA WHERE NOT
                            ONLY WE AND OUR ALLIES HAVE MOST VITAL INTEREST, BUT IN WHICH SOVIETS,
                            IRAN'S GREAT NEIGHBOR TO NORTH, HAVE BEEN MAKING SERIOUS INROADS ABOUT
                            WHICH SHAH IS MUCH CONCERNED AND WISHES TO DISCUSS WITH PRESIDENT.</p>
                        <p>I WILL SOON BE LEAVING IRAN AND WILL NOT HAVE TO TRY TO PICK UP THE
                            PIECES, BUT AS PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE I FEEL HE SHOULD KNOW
                            BEFORE I DELIVER PROPOSED MESSAGE MY VIEWS AS TO (A) DAMAGE TO IRAN-US
                            RELATIONS WHICH COULD RESULT IF PRESIDENTIAL VISIT IS NOT MADE AND (B)
                            REASONS WHY MESSAGE IN ITS PRESENT FORM COULD BE VERY
                            COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. IF MESSAGE COULD BE REVISED SO AS TO RE-AFFIRM TO
                            SHAH, AS I DID LAST APRIL AT PRESIDENT'S SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION, THAT
                            PRESIDENT WILL VISIT IRAN DURING 1972 BUT IS NOT YET IN POSITION TO FIX
                            SPECIFIC DATE, IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL IN ALLAYING GROWING
                            SUSPICIONS OF SHAH, PRIME MINISTER, ETC., AND MAINTAINING OUR POSITION
                            AND INFLUENCE IN THIS KEY COUNTRY, AN AREA WHERE OUR INTERESTS ARE
                            ENORMOUS AND YET WHERE OUR POSITION AND INFLUENCE HAVE IN GENERAL BEEN
                            DETERIORATING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. GP-3</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>By the terms of the Foreign Assistance Act for economically developed
                            countries, Iran must buy its military purchases from the US on a cash or
                            credits basis. As you know, they do so substantially every year. In
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72 with <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> financing, Iran's program will be $140 million.</p>
                        <p>We have, however, provided some grant assistance to underwrite a training
                            program complementing Iran's large sales program; it provides for the
                            maintenance of our military advisors mission in Iran and training both
                            there and in the US. The Shah attaches great importance to this program
                            which gives his armed forces across the board advice on all aspects of
                            their modernization and progress.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Assistance Act, however, prohibits grant assistance in excess
                            of $500,000 to "any economically developed country capable of sustaining
                            its own defense burden and economic growth" unless you sign a
                            determination that such assistance is important to US security. Our
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72 grant assistance program is
                            $942,000 and to permit us to go ahead with this, you will have to sign
                            such a determination. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> recommend you do so in the memoranda at Tab B.
                            For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 you signed a similar
                            determination under which we provided grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in the amount of $2.4 million.</p>
                        <p>To put this in perspective, we have indicated that we would be reducing
                            substantially grant assistance to Iran in line with worldwide
                            reductions. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            observes, Iran still has requirements for technical personnel and pilots
                            which would justify our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72
                            expenditure. He also indicates that we will be revising our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 73 and subsequent programs downward to
                            approximately the permissible $500,000.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. COURT MINISTER ALAM ASKED ME TO CALL URGENTLY THIS MORNING (JAN 13) TO
                            CONVEY IMPORTANT MESSAGE RE BAHRAIN WHICH SHAH WISHED PASSED TO
                            PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY. MESSAGE IS TO EFFECT THAT EVEN THOUGH US UNDER
                            FIRE FROM RADICAL ARABS AND THEIR COMMUNIST SUPPORTERS FOR MAINTAINING
                            ITS PORT FACILITIES IN BAHRAIN, IF US STICKS FIRMLY TO ITS POSITION AND
                            REMAINS THERE, IT WILL BE A BLESSING "FOR YOU AS WELL AS FOR US.”
                            HOWEVER, IF US SHOULD EVER CONTEMPLATE WITHDRAWING FROM BAHRAIN EITHER
                            (A) BECAUSE BAHRAIN ASKS US TO GO OR (B) BECAUSE OF PRESSURES FOR US
                            WITHDRAWAL FROM RADICAL ARABS AND POSSIBLY EGYPT ENCOURAGED BY SOVIET
                            UNION, SHAH ASKS THAT WE LET HIM KNOW BEFORE WE ANNOUNCE ANY WITHDRAWAL
                            DECISION SO THAT HE CAN LEAD CAMPAIGN FOR OUR WITHDRAWAL RATHER THAN LET
                            IT BE PORTRAYED AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE FROM RADICAL ARABS AND SOVIETS.
                            THIS WOULD ENABLE SHAH "TO SHOUT LOUDER AND LONGER" AGAINST ANY SOVIET
                            EFFORTS TO SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL NAVAL FACILITIES ON ARAB SIDE
                            OF GULF.</p>
                        <p>2. I SAID TO ALAM THAT I WOULD OF COURSE CONVEY ABOVE MESSAGE BUT I KNEW
                            PRESIDENT HAD WEIGHED VERY CAREFULLY DECISION FOR MIDEASTFOR TO REMAIN
                            IN BAHRAIN AND I DID NOT THINK SHAH HAD CAUSE TO WORRY ABOUT A
                            WITHDRAWAL BECAUSE OF CLAMOR OF RADICAL ARAB STATES AND OTHERS FOLLOWING
                            UNFORTUNATE MANNER IN WHICH CONTINUATION OF MIDEASTFOR IN BAHRAIN HAD
                            BEEN PRESENTED IN AMERICAN AND CERTAIN FOREIGN PRESS. ALAM REPLIED THAT
                            HE HOPED OUR INTENTION TO STAY IN BAHRAIN WAS FIRM BUT SHAH WAS
                            BASICALLY CONCERNED LEST (A) BAHRAIN RULER ASKS US TO LEAVE AS RESULT OF
                            RADICAL ARAB PRESSURE OR (B) WE GIVE IN TO PRESSURE FROM RADICAL ARABS
                            AND POSSIBLY EGYPT (IF WE DELIVER MORE PHANTOMS TO ISRAEL) AND OTHER
                            MORE <pb n="2" xml:id="d159-02" facs="d159-02"/>MODERATE ARAB STATES. IN
                            EITHER CASE ARAB STATES DEMANDING OUR WITHDRAWAL AND SOVIETS WHO WERE
                            BEHIND THEM SPURRING THEM ON WOULD ALONE GET CREDIT FOR FORCING US OUT
                            AND THIS WOULD HAVE UNFORTUNATE IF NOT DANGEROUS REPERCUSSIONS IN THIS
                            STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT AREA.</p>
                        <p>3. COMMENT: ABOVE MESSAGE IS STILL ANOTHER INDICATION OF SHAH'S DEEP
                            CONCERN RE (A) INCREASING SOVIET ADVANCES, INFLUENCE AND PRESSURES IN

                            13 AND TEHRAN JOURNAL JANUARY 15 CARRIED LONG EDITORIAL EXPRESSING
                            SURPRISE AT AND OBJECTION TO AGREEMENT "UNDER WHICH US MIDDLE EAST FLEET
                            WILL BE ABLE TO USE PART OF OLD BRITISH NAVAL BASE IN PERSIAN GULF.”
                            EDITORIAL REVIEWS ARRANGEMENTS BY WHICH US NAVY ESTABLISHED PRESENCE IN
                            GULF. QUESTIONS RIGHT BAHRAIN TO PERMIT FOREIGN MILITARY PRESENCE IN
                            GULF AND URGES US TO RECONSIDER THIS ARRANGEMENT AND LEAVE THE GULF.
                            FOLLOWING POINTS MADE IN EDITORIAL:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d160-02" facs="d160-02"/>
                        <p>(A) IT "RATHER STRANGE" AFTER ALL EFFORT TO GET SOUTHERN COAST OF PERSIAN
                            GULF FREE FROM BRITISH AND TO RESTORE NAVAL LEADERSHIP TO REGIONAL
                            POWERS AND WHEN, AFTER CENTURIES COLONIALISM FINALLY ENDING, THAT
                            ANOTHER OUTSIDE POWER SHOULD BE PERMITTED REPLACE BRITAIN.”</p>
                        <p>(B) THIS MORE-SURPRISING IN VIEW IRAN'S OFT-REPEATED POSITION GULF STATES
                            THEMSELVES MUST ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR AREA WITH NO OUTSIDE COUNTRIES
                            "PERMITTED" REPLACE BRITAIN.</p>
                        <p>(C) "UNDER AGREEMENT WITH BRITAIN" THREE US WARSHIPS ARRIVED IN BAHRAIN
                            12 YEARS AGO "ON PRETEXT OF REPAIRS AND REFUELING" AND HAVE REMAINED
                            THERE SINCE. IT IS SURPRISING THAT DURING THIS NEW CHAPTER OF HISTORY
                            AMERICANS STAY ON AND ONE MUST WONDER "TO WHAT PURPOSES THEY HAVE SIGNED
                            AGREEMENT WITH BAHRAIN TO CONTINUE THEIR PRESENCE HERE.” DESPITE
                            BIFTMUBARAK'S STATEMENT THAT BAHRAIN HAS NO SECRET AGREEMENT WITH US,
                            PRESENCE OF THREE WARSHIPS, EVEN FOR REPAIRS AND REFUELING, "CANNOT BUT
                            BE ACCEPTED WITH MISGIVINGS.”</p>
                        <p>(D) SINCE THIS DEVELOPMENT "RELATES TO SECURITY OF ALL PEOPLES OF THE
                            REGION NO LITTORAL STATE HAS THE RIGHT TO GRANT PERMISSION TO FOREIGN
                            COUNTRY, LARGE OR SMALL, TO MAINTAIN MILITARY PRESENCE IN GULF EVEN FOR
                            REPAIRS AND REFUELING PURPOSES BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY
                            THAT SUCH ACTION MAY LEAD TO ENDANGERING SECURITY OF OTHER NATIONS.”
                            CONDUCT OF US "WHICH HAS ALWAYS PROFESSED IT WAS SUPPORTER OF LIBERTY
                            AND FREEDOM OF OTHERS IS SURPRISING,” AND US SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS
                            ACTION IS LIKELY TO "CREATE MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN THE REGION.” (E)
                            SOVIETS AND OTHERS ARE FULLY JUSTIFIED IN PROTESTING STATIONING OF THREE
                            AMERICAN WARSHIPS IN THE REGION. IRAN HAS "EVEN GREATER RIGHT TO PROTEST
                            THIS UNWISE ACTION WHICH CERTAINLY IS AGAINST INTERESTS OF REGIONAL
                            SECURITY AND THAT US SHOULD REVIEW ITS WRONG POLICY, TO SAY THE LEAST,
                            AND LEAVE THE PERSIAN GULF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.” ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD
                            KNOW "THAT THE PERSIAN GULF IS ' NOT OPEN TO IMPERIALIST DESIGNS BY
                            OUTSIDE POWERS AND REGIONAL <pb n="3" xml:id="d160-03" facs="d160-03"/>POWERS SHALL COMBAT WITH ALL MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL ATTEMPTS BY

                            CERTAINLY IN ORDER AND SUGGEST THAT IN ADDITION TO TAKING QUESTION UP
                            WITH ALAM (TEHRAN 279), AMBASSADOR CONSIDER BROACHING SUBJECT DIRECTLY
                            WITH SHAH IN FORTHCOMING JAN 20 MEETING. POINTS THAT MIGHT BE MADE ARE
                            (A) WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF GIVING IN TO RADICAL ARAB PRESSURES TO
                            WITHDRAW <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> FROM

                            OUTBURST; (C) BAHRAIN WHICH IS MAKING ARRANGEMENT CLEARLY ANTICIPATED
                            POSSIBILITY SOME ADVERSE ARAB REACTION, HAS MADE NO REQUEST OF US TO
                            WITHDRAW AND WE DO NOT EXPECT IT WILL; (D) AGREEMENT WITH BAHRAIN
                            PROVIDES EITHER PARTY CAN TERMINATE IT AT <pb n="2" xml:id="d162-02" facs="d162-02"/>ANY TIME BUT WE ARE GIVEN UP TO ONE YEAR TO

                            DESIRABLE; (E) WE FELT IRAN HAD BEEN CLEAR IN ITS DESIRE THAT <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> PRESENCE BE CONTINUED
                            (TEHRAN 249) AND THAT IT FELT AS WE DO THAT IT IS A STABILIZING FORCE IN
                            AREA WHERE FRAGILE, NEWLY INDEPENDENT STATES JUST COMING INTO BEING, AND
                            WHERE SOVIETS CAN BE EXPECTED TO TRY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY
                            WEAKNESSES THEY CAN UNCOVER; (F) WE DO NOT THEREFORE UNDERSTAND ETELA-AT
                            EDITORIAL WHICH ASKS US TO RECONSIDER <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> ARRANGEMENT AND LEAVE GULF; INDEED WE WOULD
                            EXPECT IRAN WOULD BE QUIETLY WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO DAMPEN

                            MINUTES. DISCUSSION WAS WIDE-RANGING COVERING (A) HIS DESIRE TO BUILD UP
                            IRANIAN NAVY (REPORTED SEPARATELY) AND DEVELOP CHAR BAHAR AS AIR-NAVAL
                            BASE (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>): (B) HIS WELL-KNOWN
                            VIEW PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RE DETERIORATION OF SITUATION ON HIS EASTERN
                            AND WESTERN FRONTIERS AND HIS CONCERN RE SUBSTANTIAL SOVIET GAINS IN
                            MID-EAST/SOUTH ASIAN AREA IN PAST EIGHT MONTHS WITH POSSIBLITY IRAN
                            MIGHT FIND ITSELF INCREASINGLY ISOLATED: AND (C) HIS GROWING CONCERN AND
                            DOUBTS ABOUT WISDON OF MAINTAINING MIDEASTFOR IN BAHRAIN, WHICH SUBJECT
                            COVERED MAJOR PART OF DISCUSSION. SHAH INDICATED HE FEELS OBLIGED TO
                            CONTINUE CRITICIZE <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            PRESENCE IN GULF BUT IF US IS "REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT REMAINING IN GULF,”
                            HE WOULD NOT PRIVIATELY OBJECT.</p>
                        <p>1. SHAH RAISED SUBJECT OF GULF AND <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> FACILITIES IN BAHRAIN. HE SAID SINCE BRITISH
                            ANNOUNCEMENT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM GULF IN 1968, HE HAD CONSISTENTLY TAKEN
                            PUBLIC POSITION THAT AFTER BRITISH WITHDRAWAL NO ONE SHOULD REPLACE THEM
                            THERE, THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FOREIGN PRESENCE IN GULF AND THAT
                            LITTORAL STATES SHOULD COOPERATE DO SECURE SECURITY OF THAT VITAL BODY
                            OF WATER. HE COULD NOT BACKTRACK ON THIS POSITION FOR HE BELIEVED IN IT
                            AND IF HE BACKTRACKED HIS POSITION OF LEADERSHIP IN AREA WOULD BE
                            ENDED.</p>
                        <p>2. HE SAID HE IS THEREFORE OBLIGED PUBLICLY TO CRITICIZE BASE AGREEMENT
                            WE HAVE MADE WITH BAHRAIN. HOWEVER, HE WANTED TO SAY MOST
                            CONFIDENTIALLY—” AND HE HOPED HE WOULD NOT READ ABOUT IT IN THE
                            NEWSPAPERS"—THAT IS [IF?] <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IS "REALY
                            SERIOUS ABOUT REMAINING IN GULF AND SHOWS IT BY ITS ACTIONS,” HE WOULD
                            NOT OBJECT TO OUR PRESENCE THERE. AT SAME TIME HE WANTED US FRANKLY TO
                            KNOW HE WOULD STILL FEEL OBLIGED TO CRITICIZE PUBLICLY OUR AGREEMENT
                            WITH BAHRAIN.</p>
                        <p>3. WE EXPLAINED TO SHAH (AS AMBASSADOR HAD PREVIOUSLY) THAT THERE IS
                            NOTHING NEW IN OUR PRESENCE IN BAHRAIN; THAT <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> HAD BEEN THERE FOR YEARS
                            AND WAS NOT IN ANY SENSE REPLACING BRITISH; AND THAT FACILITIES WE USE
                            THERE ARE LARGELY COMMERCIAL AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES AND
                            FACILITIES FOR RECREATION AND DEPENDENTS IN WHICH WE USE ONLY A SMALL
                            PORTION OF OLD BRITISH BASE.</p>
                        <p>4. SHAH SAID HE KNEW ALL THIS AND HAD DISCUSSED IT A FEW DAYS AGO WITH
                            AMBASSADOR. HOWEVER, SOVIETS, EGYPTIANS AND SOME MODERATE AS WELL AS
                            RADICAL ARABS AS WELL AS AMERICAN PRESS AND CONGRESS ALL PUBLICLY
                            PROCLAIM WE HAD ACQUIRED NAVAL BASE IN BAHRAIN. HE IS OBLIGED TO OPPOSE
                            THIS. HOWEVER, HE REITERATED CONFIDENTIALLY THAT IF WE ARE "REALLY
                            SERIOUS,” HE HAS NO OBJECTION TO OUR PRESENCE THERE. HOWEVER, IF WE ARE
                            NOT, HE THOUGHT OUR PRESENCE THERE WOULD BRING GRIEF TO AREA AND DO MORE
                            HARM THAN GOOD.</p>
                        <p>5. WE ASKED WHAT HE MEANT BY "REALLY SERIOUS.” HE REPLIED SOVIET NAVY HAS
                            BEEN VISITING GULF WITH MOST MODERN VESSELS, INCLUDING 15,000 TON
                            CRUSIER, MISSILE SHIPS, SUBMARINES, ETC., WHEREAS US IS IN BAHRAIN AND
                            GULF WITH ONLY TWO OBSOLESCENT DESTROYERS AND NON-COMBATANT FLAGSHIP.
                            THIS SIMPLY DRAWS ATTACKS ON US. IF WE ARE "SERIOUS,” WE WOULD
                            SUPPLEMENT <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> PRESENCE IN
                            BAHRAIN BY MATACHING RUSSIAN NAVAL VISITS WITH VISITS BY MODERN
                            EQUIVALENT US FLEET UNITS, ADDING, "IF RUSSIANS BRING IN A 15,000 TON
                            CRUSIER TO SHOW FLAG, YOU SHOULD BRING IN ONE OF 20,000 TONS.”</p>
                        <p>6. WE SAID WE WOULD REPORT HIS VIEWS BUT POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE OTHER
                            VERY IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT ASPECTS TO OUR PRESENCE IN GULF. FOR
                            EXAMPLE, WHAT WOULD BE EFFECT ON MODERATE ARAB GULF STATES IF US
                            WITHDREW FROM BAHRAIN AND GULF AS RESULT OF SOVIET AND RADICAL ARAB
                            PROPAGANDA ATTACKS? WOULD NOT MODERATE GULF ARAB STATES THAT DID NOT
                            HAVE STRENGTH AND SUPERIOR LEADERSHIP THAT SHAH GAVE IRAN GAIN
                            IMPRESSION THAT US WAS ABANDONING AREA TO SOVIET-RADICAL ARAB TAKE-OVER?
                            AND IF THEY HAD SUCH IMPRESSION, WOULD NOT THIS CAUSE THEM TO FEEL
                            SOVIETS ARE WAVE OF FUTURE AND THEREFORE THEY MUST REACH ACCOMMODATION
                            WITH SOVIETS AND RADICAL ARABS AND THIS IN TURN COULD RESULT IN THEIR
                            BEING EVENTUALLY SWALLOWED UP. IF THIS HAPPENED, IRAN WOULD HAVE A VERY
                            UNFRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT ON ARAB SIDE OF GULF.</p>
                        <p>7. SHAH SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS ARGUMENT, BUT HE COULD NOT
                            CHANGE HIS BASIC POLICY AND PUBLIC STANCE, WITH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD WE
                            AGREED, THAT PEACE AND SECURITY IN GULF SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY CLOSE
                            COOPERATION OF LITTORAL STATES WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OF OUTSIDE POWERS.
                            WE SAID <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AGREED LITTORAL STATES
                            SHOULD COOPERATE TO MAINTAIN STABILITY AND SECURITY IN GULF BUT POINTED
                            OUT THAT HOME PORTING OF <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> IN BAHRAIN COULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS
                            INTERFERENCE AND THAT WE HAD NEITHER A BASE IN BAHRAIN NOR ANY MILITARY
                            OR POLITICAL COMMITMENTS. RULER OF BAHRAIN, WHOM SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_CJH2">CHAFEE</persName> HAD JUST SEEN, HAD INDICATED
                            THAT WHILE HE WANTED US THERE, HE IS DEEPLY CONCERNED BY IRAN'S
                            CRITICISM OF RECENT AGREEMENT RE <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. IF IRANIAN CRITICISM CONTINUED, IT MIGHT CAUSE
                            BAHRAIN RULER AND OTHER MODERATE ARAB GULF REGIMES WHICH DID NOT WISH US
                            TO ABANDON GULF TO TAKE POSITION SIMILAR TO IRAN'S AND REQUEST US TO
                            LEAVE. WHILE THIS WAS WHAT SOVIETS WANTED, IT WOULD NOT SEEM TO SERVE
                            INTERESTS OF IRAN.</p>
                        <p>8. SHAH SAID WHILE BAHRAIN RULER MIGHT WISH US TO STAY, HE HAD NOT SAID
                            SO PUBLICLY. SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_CJH2">CHAFEE</persName>
                            POINTED OUT RULER MADE PUBLIC STATEMENT MAKING CLEAR THAT NO BASE OR
                            OTHER COMMITMENTS OR POLITICAL DEALS WERE INVOLVED AND THAT NEW
                            AGREEMENT NECESSARY AFTER BAHRAIN RECEIVED INDEPENDENCE AND IT WAS
                            SIMPLY CONTINUATION OF OLD ARRANGEMENT. SHAH THEN TALKED AT SOME LENGTH
                            ABOUT SOVIET EFFORTS TO PENETRATE GULF AND OBSERVED THAT BY CRITICIZING
                            MIDEASTFOR PRESENCE IN GULF, HE WOULD BE IN EXCELLENT POSITION TO ATTACK
                            AND CRITICIZIE SOVIETS SHOULD THEY TRY TO GET A BASE IN GULF. IF SOVIETS
                            TRIED, HE WOULD PULL OUT ALL STOPS EVEN TAKING MATTER TO <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. WE POINTED OUT THAT AS PRACTICAL MATTER
                            SOVIETS ARE ALREADY IN GULF AS THEY ARE BUILDING A PORT AND NAVAL
                            FACILITIES FOR IRAQ. AT UMM QASR WHICH OBVIOUSLY DESTINED FOR USE BY
                            SOVIET VESSELS VISITING GULF. WE REFERRED TO EARLIER STATEMENT BY SHAH
                            THAT SOVIETS HAD NOT ONLY MANY ARMY AND AIR BUT ALSO NAVAL PERSONNEL IN
                            IRAQ, INCLUDING NUMBER IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES AT UMM QASR, WHICH WOULD
                            SUPPORT SOVIET NAVAL ACTIVITIES IN GULF.</p>
                        <p>9. DISCUSSION EBBED BACK AND FORTH WITH SHAH EXPRESSING UNDERSTANDING OF
                            POINTS WE MADE BUT MAINTAINING POSITION HE HAD EXPRESSED. FINALLY, IN
                            EFFORT TO GET AT PROBLEM FROM ANOTHER ANGLE, WE SUMMARIZED WHAT WE
                            UNDERSTOOD SHAH'S POSITION TO BE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                        <p>(A) SHAH UNDERSTANDS US HAS NOT TAKEN OVER BRITISH BASE IN BAHRAIN OR
                            REPLACED BRITISH THERE AND OUR PRESENCE IS SIMPLY CONTINUATION OF HOME
                            PORTING ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE HAD FOR MANY YEARS,</p>
                        <p>(B) HOWEVER, SOVIETS, EGYPT AND RADICAL ARAB STATES AS WELL AS US PRESS
                            AND SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALL MAINTAIN WE HAVE ACQUIRED BASE IN
                            BAHRAIN AND THEREFORE EVERYONE IN AREA BELIEVES THIS.</p>
                        <p>(C) WHILE MOST CONFIDENTIALLY SHAH DOES NOT IN PRINCIPLE OPPOSE
                            MIDEASTFOR IN GULF IF WE WILL AUGMENT IT BY VISITS OF MODERN FLEET UNITS
                            TO MATCH SOVIET ACTIVITY, HE IS PUBLICLY OBLIGED TO CRITICIZE BAHRAIN
                            ARRANGEMENT BECAUSE OF (A) CONVICTION IN AREA WE HAVE ACQUIRED A BASE
                            AND (B) HIS PUBLIC POSITION THAT BRITISH SHOULD NOT BE REPLACED, THERE
                            SHOULD BE NO FOREIGN BASES IN GULF, ETC.</p>
                        <p>(D) FINAL US DECISION REGARDING CONTINUING PRESENCE OF <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> IN BAHRAIN CAN ONLY BE
                            MADE BY US, BUT AS CLOSE FRIEND, SHAH WANTS US TO KNOW THAT UNLESS WE
                            ARE "SERIOUS" AND BY THAT HE MEANS OUR MATCHING SOVIET GULF VISITS, SHAH
                            FEELS CONTINUING <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            PRESENCE IN BAHRAIN RISKS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.</p>
                        <p>(E) US HAS NOT ADEQUATELY GOT TRUE FACTS ACROSS TO WORLD ABOUT BAHRAIN
                            AGREEMENT AND UNLESS WE CAN COUNTER SOVIET AND ARAB PROPAGANDA AND
                            CONVINCE PEOPLE IN AREA THAT WE HAVE NOT OBTAINED BASE IN BAHRAIN, HE
                            HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO BE CRITICIAL OF OUR PRESENCE. SHAH SAID THIS WAS
                            FAIR SUMMARY OF HOW HE VIEWED MATTER.</p>
                        <p>10. WE AGAIN POINTED OUT THAT CONTINUED CRITICAL COMMENT FROM IRAN,
                            PARTICULARLY AT THIS DELICATE AND DIFFICULT TIME FOR RULER OF BAHRAIN,
                            COULD DO MUCH HARM. SINCE SHAH HAD ALREADY MADE HIS POINT PUBLICLY, WAS
                            THERE ANY PRESSING NEED FOR IRAN TO SAY ANYTHING MORE AT THIS TIME?
                            COULD NOT IRAN REMAIN SILENT FOR PERIOD TO SEE WHETHER INITAL PROPAGANDA
                            ASSAULT LAUNCHED BY SOVIETS AND RADICAL ARABS WHO WISHED TO SEE ALL
                            VESTIGES OF AMERICAN PRESENCE AND INFLUENCE ELIMINATED FROM AREA WOULD
                            DIE DOWN AS HAD FUROR OVER ISLANDS? WHILE SHAH MADE NO COMMITMENT ABOUT
                            THIS REQUEST FOR MORATORIUM ON IRANIAN STATEMENTS, HE DID NOT CHALLENGE
                            CONTENTION THAT HAVING ALREADY MADE HIS OWN POSITION PUBLICLY CLEAR
                            PARTICULARLY TO COUNTRIES IN THIS AREA, THERE IS NO NEED IN IMMEDIATE
                            FUTURE TO MAKE FURTHER CRITICAL STATEMENTS.</p>
                        <p>11. COMMENT:</p>
                        <p>(A) ALTHOUGH DISCUSSION WAS LONG AND ON OCCASION DIFFICULT, SHAH WAS AT
                            ALL TIMES PERSONALLY FRIENDLY AND REITERATED HIS STRONG FRIENDSHIP FOR
                            US AND APPRECIATION FOR ITS COOPERATION, WHICH HE SAID IRAN NEEDED JUST
                            AS US NEEDS IRAN'S FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION IN THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT
                            AREA.</p>
                        <p>(B) POSITION SHAH TOOK IN ABOVE MEETING IS SUB- STANTIALLY MORE CRITICAL
                            THAN POSITION HE TOOK FORTY-EIGHT HOURS BEFORE WITH AMBASSADOR (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>). WE BELIEVE IT REFLECTS HIS
                            INCREASING PREOCCUPATION OVER POSSIBILITY IRAN MAY FIND ITSELF LARGELY
                            ISOLATED BY FUTURE SOVIET GAINS IN AREA AND ALSO CORRESPONDING DOUBTS AS
                            TO WHETHER US HAS DETERMINATION, WILL AND ABILITY TO REMAIN IN AREA, IN
                            THIS CONNECTION WHEN WE SAID OUR DETERMINATION TO REMAIN IN THIS VITAL
                            AREA IS FIRM, HE COMMENTED THAT WHILE HE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN
                            PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> AND WOULD LIKE TO
                            SEE HIM RE-ELECTED, HE WONDERED WHETHER CONGRESS AND AMERICAN PEOPLE IN
                            THEIR PRESENT MOOD WOULD PERMIT PRESIDENT TO FOLLOW THE POLICIES HE HAD
                            LAID OUT.</p>
                        <p>(C) ALTHOUGH SHAH MADE NO COMMITMENT TO SUSPEND CRITICAL COMMENTS ON OUR
                            BAHRAIN ARRANGEMENT, WE BOTH HAD IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS REASONABLE
                            POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY BE RESPONSIVE TO OUR REQUEST AT LEAST FOR TIME
                            BEING. FACT HE IS LEAVING NEXT WEEK FOR ONE MONTH PRIVATE VISIT TO
                            SWITZERLAND WOULD ALSO AFFORD PRETEXT FOR NOT MAKING ANY PUBLIC
                            STATEMENTS ON BAHRAIN. IF HE DOES DECLARE MORATORIUM, HOW LONG HE WILL
                            KEEP IT WOULD PROBABLY DEPEND ON WHETHER PROPAGANDA FUROR BY SOVIETS AND
                            RADICAL ARABS DIES DOWN. THIS IN TURN MAY BE LARGELY DETERMINED BY HOW
                            US CONGRESS AND AMERICAN PRESS TREAT THIS QUESTION IN CONGRESSIONAL
                            DISCUSSIONS ON OUR BAHRAIN ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH WE UNDERSTAND ARE PLANNED
                            FOR NEAR FUTURE.</p>

                        <p>The Shah of Iran has expressed interest in reaching an understanding with
                            the United States to assure the supply of sophisticated American arms to
                            Iran until 1980. He is, among other things, looking forward to receiving
                            a newer generation of fighter aircraft than the F-4 Phantoms he is now
                            getting. It is therefore timely to examine Iran's current strategic
                            posture and concomitant military needs, and to attempt to relate U.S.
                            interests to possible future developments in the Shah's "independent
                            national policy.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>The celebration last October of 2,500 years of the Iranian monarchy
                            serves as a useful reference point in assessing the emergence of Iran as
                            an independent political and military power in the Persian Gulf,
                            especially as it affects Iran's relations with the United States and has
                            intensified the perennial Iranian feud with Iraq.</p>
                        <p>The Shah has made clear the purpose of Iran's "independent national
                            policy.” The buildup in Iranian military strength in anticipation of
                            British military withdrawal from the Gulf means that Iran intends to
                            play a predominant role in the Persian Gulf area, free of great-power

                        <p>The Shah wants Iran to be a leading force in the protection of the Gulf
                            against subversion or military attack by radical Arab regimes. To this
                            end, he has built up a substantial military establishment equipped with
                            late-model American, British, and Soviet weapons. He has plans for even
                            more elaborate military forces.</p>
                        <p>While he is immediately concerned with the threat posed by Iraq, the
                            Shah's strategic interests center on the Persian Gulf and extend into
                            the Indian Ocean. He has seized upon that part of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine which emphasizes the
                            responsibility of regional powers for the defense and security of
                            specific areas, and believes Iran can fulfill this role in its
                            region.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's effort to assume that role may introduce strains into the
                            long-standing U.S.-Iran military supply relationship, as he increasingly
                            judges U.S. support for Iran by its willingness to supply the arms he
                            wants. Moreover, the increasingly assertive role of Iran in the region
                            may to some extent diverge from U.S. interests in the Gulf. While no
                            sharp estrangement is likely between the U.S. and Iran, the ties between
                            the two countries may eventually become looser. The possibility of
                            Iran-Iraq hostilities and of growing political tension in Iran are
                            factors which could also complicate U.S. policy in the Gulf.</p>

                            1971)</p>
                        <p>The celebration last October of the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian
                            monarchy marked for Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi a new stage in the
                            development of Iran's "independent national policy,” as the quoted
                            statements demonstrate. Nor were these remarks intended merely as brave
                            words, for the Shah conveyed much the same message in private to
                            visiting foreign statesmen. To put it succinctly, Iran intends to play a
                            prominent role in the Persian Gulf,and even in the Indian Ocean,now that
                            British military forces have left the area; if necessary, Iran is also
                            prepared to deal militarily with Iraq, which the Shah considers the
                            region's arch-troublemaker. To support its policy, Iran has created an
                            impressive modern military force which will continue to receive the best
                            modern non-nuclear equipment the Shah can procure.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Challenge</p>
                        <p>The termination of Britain's military role in the Persian Gulf has
                            compelled the Shah to focus on Iran's future role, which he sees as that
                            of a strong, independent power capable of protecting its interests and
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d164-04" facs="d164-04"/>insuring stability
                            throughout the Gulf. In the Shah's view, the changed situation in the
                            Gulf will provide new opportunities for radical Arab regimes and
                            movements to step up their attempts to subvert the Arab states on the
                            western and southern shores of the Gulf. He fears the spread of radical
                            military adventures similar to the guerrilla war troubling western
                            Oman.</p>
                        <p>The Shah perceives the radical threat as a direct concern to Iran. All of
                            Iran's vital petroleum exports must transit the Gulf, and all its major
                            ports are located on the Gulf, or on the Shatt al 'Arab which empties
                            into the Gulf. Access to the Gulf is thus central to Iran's economic
                            well-being and security. It was this fact that underlay the Shah's
                            insistence on obtaining control of the lower Gulf islands of the Tunbs
                            and Abu Musa, near the Strait of Hormuz. The same concern also explains
                            Iran's recent rapprochement with Egypt after a ten-year break in
                            relations. While the Shah distrusted NASSER as the source of all evil in
                            the radical Arab World,he regards <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> as a possible counterweight to radical,
                            unpredictable Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Iran's differences with Iraq are of long standing and center on the
                            location of the boundary and control over shipping in the Shatt al
                            'Arab. More recently, Iraq has emerged as a threat to the stability and
                            security of the Persian Gulf through its sponsorship of subversion and
                            discord in the coastal sheikhdoms.</p>
                        <p>In talking to U.S. officials, the Shah has also stressed his fears of
                            increased Soviet penetration of the Gulf. As a practical matter of
                            policy he probably continues to believe that the Soviets attach major
                            value to good bilateral relations with Iran and that a direct Soviet
                            military move against Iran is unlikely. He is more concerned about
                            Soviet support of radical Arab regimes such as those in Iraq and South
                            Yemen or those that might emerge in the Gulf. His fears of "Soviet
                            encirclement,” most recently expressed in connection with the USSR's
                            support for India in the Indo-Pakistani war, are very real and intensify
                            his sense of need for continued U.S. support.</p>
                        <p>For the long term, however, he envisages the development of regional
                            power centers (Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan) capable of excluding
                            undue great-power influence from the Gulf and the Indian Ocean without
                            reliance on any foreign alliance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iran's Response: Strength</p>
                        <p>For most of the past decade the Shah justified his need to build up his
                            armed fors by pointing to the lavish amounts of equipment the <pb n="5" xml:id="d164-05" facs="d164-05"/>Soviets were supplying to Iraq,
                            Syria, and Egypt. Now Iran is strong enough to meet a direct military
                            threat from Iraq. Military support for Iraq from Egypt and Syria is very
                            unlikely under present circumstances. However, now that the British have
                            withdrawn from the Gulf, the Shah sees a need for an Iranian deterrent
                            to radical Arab action in the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula. To fulfill
                            this more ambitious mission, the Shah wants to further enhance Iran's
                            military power. Iran has the necessary funds, since its oil revenues
                            have grown to over $1.8 billion annually in the past fifteen years. The
                            Iranian military budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972
                            totalled $1,023 million, 22 percent of the total budget and 10 percent
                            of the Iranian <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. Its expenditures for
                            military purchases abroad now total more than $600 million annually. </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iraq-Iran Armed Forces: Comparison</p>
                        <p>The 8,500-man Iraqi air force, which Iran views as its most immediate
                            threat, has in its inventory 91 MIG-21 aircraft, of which perhaps
                            two-thirds are operational. In addition, it has 33 MIG-17's, 46 Hawker
                            Hunters, and 62 SU-7 Fitters, virtually all operationally assigned. It
                            has some potential strategic capability, with 9 TU-16 bombers. In 1971,
                            150 of the 260 Iraqi pilots were jet-qualified, and 90 were listed as
                            combat-ready. Additional pilots are being trained, primarily in the
                            Soviet Union. The air force suffers from a generally low level of
                            education, training, morale, and discipline, and has been further
                            reduced in effectiveness by repeated political purges.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian air force inventory now includes 56 F-4 Phantom jet fighters
                            and 109 F-5's. Present plans call for Iran's F-4 strength to be
                            increased to 128 or more by 1975. The 26,000-man Iranian air force in
                            1971 included 312 pilots, of whom 220 were jet-qualified and 115 were
                            listed as combat-ready. Ongoing pilot training, in Iran and the United
                            States, is constantly adding to that total. While qualitative
                            comparisons are risky, the Iranian air force is clearly superior to the
                            Iraqi in motivation, training, organization, and mastery of technical
                            maintenance, although Iran still depends on U.S. personnel for some
                            aspects of advanced maintenance of its F-4 aircraft.</p>
                        <p>On the ground, the Iraqi army boasts an inventory of good Soviet
                            equipment, including 784 tanks (700 of them T-54/55), 1,080 APC's, and
                            705 artillery pieces. However, the low morale and poor standard of
                            training of its 90,000 men, compounded by a weak logistics system, limit
                            severely the army's offensive capabilities.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d164-06" facs="d164-06"/>
                        <p>The Iranian army's present equipment inventory is not markedly superior
                            to Iraq's, with 862 tanks (402 M-47, 460 M-60), 881 APC's, and 1,254
                            artillery pieces, but the training, organization, morale, and technical
                            effectiveness of Iran's 152,000 troops are clearly superior. Since 1967
                            the mobility of Iran's ground forces has been enhanced by large
                            purchases of Soviet military trucks and APC's, and by the acquisition of
                            U.S.-built C-130's (34 on hand, with a total of 50 planned).</p>
                        <p>The Iraqi navy has no combat capability. The Soviet Union has failed to
                            deliver Komar missile boats promised under an old contract. In contrast,
                            the Iranian navy has one newly-refitted ex-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> destroyer, twelve patrol craft, and eight British-built
                            hovercraft. Four more new British-built frigates are now being
                            delivered, and by late 1972 two more reconditioned ex-USN destroyers
                            should arrive in Iran.</p>
                        <p>The bulk of the Iranian army and air force and all of the navy are
                            disposed along or within reach of the border with Iraq or in the Persian
                            Gulf. As there are no reserves, this force in being constitutes the
                            entire existing deterrent capability of Iran. The Shah's future plans,
                            to the extent they are known, are designed to add formidable dimensions
                            to this deterrent.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">More Equipment To Come</p>
                        <p>A pilot himself, the Shah is adamant that Iran must have next-generation
                            fighter aircraft such as the F-15. He is periodically lobbied by the
                            French, the Soviets, and most recently the British and Germans jointly,
                            and he follows closely developments in aircraft design outside the
                            United States. However, he says he wants to keep his air force
                            American-equipped. He recently proposed that firm assurances be offered
                            to extend U.S. military sales to Iran up to 1980.</p>
                        <p>In addition to wanting more sophisticated aircraft, the Shah has
                            indicated for some time that he desires an aerial refuelling capability
                            to extend the range of his F-4's across the Gulf and out into the Indian
                            Ocean. (He thought about an aircraft carrier but decided it would be too
                            expensive.) He has considered the idea of a major new Iranian naval base
                            at Chah Bahar on the Gulf of Oman near the Pakistan border. Should this
                            idea be carried out, Iran would have a base well beyond the Strait of
                            Hormuz. The Shah would also like a deepwater navy for Indian Ocean
                            operations, which would require bigger ships than he now has. In the
                            missile field, Iran is asking for more Hawk missiles, and the Shah has
                            inquired about sophisticated anti-<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            missiles. His navy has British naval missiles, and the U.S. has
                            undertaken to provide other naval missiles.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d164-07" facs="d164-07"/>
                        <p>Iran has ordered some 300 British Chieftain tanks and apparently has
                            options on about 400 more. In addition to Soviet 130 mm artillery, the
                            Iranians intend to purchase 52 U.S.-built 175 mm/8" self-propelled guns.
                            Iran's retrofit facility to modernize and up-gun its M-47 tanks should
                            get into production late this year. Iran now has over 165 helicopters;
                            and the airmobile infantry concept, which requires a large helicopter
                            fleet, has attracted the Iranian ruler's interest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for the United States</p>
                        <p>Much of this interest is no doubt due to prudent forward planning in an
                            era when leadtimes for new weapons stretch out to years. However, with
                            the departure of the British, the Shah sees Iran as the major Gulf power
                            and in need of a truly credible deterrent. He is thus already looking
                            beyond the immediate post-1971 period and seeks to prepare Iran for the
                            pivotal role which, in his view, it should play in the region. He
                            believes that only he and his government can determine Iran's present
                            and future military requirements commensurate to its new role.</p>
                        <p>Thus, outsiders' estimates of what Iran needs will not necessarily
                            determine what Iran will seek to acquire. Iran will try to fill its
                            self-determined military needs, even if a principal supplier should
                            balk. Doubtless, other sources will be available. The Shah has also been
                            mindful of the hazards inherent in reliance on a single outside
                            supplier, particularly since the U.S. cut off military supplies to
                            Pakistan in 1965.</p>
                        <p>The Shah still values highly his relationship with the U.S., but he sees
                            it increasingly in terms of American willingness to assist in the
                            upgrading of his forces. Today, this means primarily the provision of
                            sales credits and expert advice in dealing with commercial U.S. arms
                            suppliers.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. military mission in Iran has evolved into a high-level joint
                            planning body providing expertise in setting force goals and developing
                            plans for efficient use of Iranian manpower. The Shah views <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> primarily as a servicing
                            agency to monitor and facilitate U.S. military sales to Iran and
                            stateside training of Iranian pilots and specialists. There is little
                            evidence that he pays much heed to any efforts on the part of <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> to influence the scope
                            of his armament efforts or his concept of what Iran needs. Rather, as
                            the Shah has developed confidence in Iranian capabilities in military
                            matters as well as in other fields, he has moved from a position of some
                            dependence on his American advisers to one which sees them largely as a
                            reliable and helpful channel to his American suppliers.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d164-08" facs="d164-08"/>
                        <p>In the evolution of his military relationship with the United States, the
                            Shah has seized on that part of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine which recognizes the primary
                            responsibility of regional powers for protecting the security and
                            stability of specific areas. Consequently, in his mind the United States
                            should be willing to provide Iran with the equipment and know-how
                            required to play this role.</p>
                        <p>In negotiating future arms supply agreements with the U.S., the Shah
                            possesses at least one concrete advantage. In a more relaxed
                            international security environment the overall strategic value of Iran
                            to the U.S. may become debatable. However, the United States retains
                            facilities in Iran which are considered vital to U.S. national security
                            interests. Substitutes may be available by about 1975, but as long as
                            they remain of major importance to the U.S., the Shah can utilize this
                            U.S. need in bargaining for arms supplies.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Diverging U.S. and Iranian Interests</p>
                        <p>For some years now Iran has followed a more assertive foreign policy,
                            taking advantage of the dissipating cold-war atmosphere and Soviet
                            desire to improve relations with its neighbors. This "independent
                            foreign policy" has received a new impetus with the end of the British
                            military presence in the Gulf. Iranian "condemnation" of the continued
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence in
                            Bahrain, which they tell us is for public consumption only, is
                            indicative of the Shah's desire to assert Iran's role as the Gulf's
                            leading power. In principle, he wants no permanent foreign military
                            presence in the Gulf and would prefer that no great-power competition
                            between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. develop either in the Gulf or in the
                            Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>This attitude is consistent with the Shah's long-time effort to restore
                            Iran to a position of greater prominence. He has succeeded, at least for
                            the time being, in his internal reforms and has muted the once-vocal
                            opposition. Now the opportunity offers itself for a significantly
                            expanded Iranian role in regional affairs. There can be no doubt that
                            the Shah will exploit this opportunity as energetically as he can. He
                            will wish to assert Iranian influence in the small amirates on the newly
                            independent Arabian side of the Gulf. He will seek to exclude, or at
                            least to limit, the influence of Iraq or other radical Arab regimes. In
                            broad outline such a policy is likely to coincide with U.S. goals, but
                            in specifics there will probably be divergences. The Shah and his
                            government will certainly not wish to weaken seriously their ties with
                            the U.S., but they may well object, at least in public, to any sign of
                            U.S. interest in playing a proprietary role in Gulf affairs. The U.S. on
                            its part may come to view some of the Iranian moves in Gulf affairs as
                            adventurous and detrimental to overall Arab-Iranian relations and Gulf
                            stability.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d164-09" facs="d164-09"/>
                        <p>Strains thus could develop which over time may contribute to a loosening
                            of the close ties between the two countries without, however, leading to
                            a serious estrangement. It is most unlikely that Iran will decide that
                            it can dispense with U.S. support, no matter how much it may stress an
                            independent foreign policy and an independent role in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>In the shorter term, the greatest challenge to the harmony of the
                            US-Iranian relationship lies in the three-way rivalry among Iran, Iraq,
                            and Saudi Arabia for influence in the Persian Gulf area. As the friend
                            of both Iran and Saudi Arabia, the U.S. would obviously be embarrassed
                            by any dispute that arose between them.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that U.S.-Iranian relations would also be complicated by
                            open hostilities between Iran and Iran. In these circumstances, Iraqi
                            propaganda would undoubtedly play up Iranian supply of petroleum to
                            Israel and proclaim Iranian complicity in the U.S.-backed "Zionist
                            conspiracy.” Even the conservative Arab regimes like that in Saudi
                            Arabia would have to pay some deference to the cause of Arab solidarity,
                            and the U.S. effort to preserve a meaningful dialogue with Egypt would
                            become even more difficult than it is today.</p>
                        <p>The Shah would undoubtedly seek to project the image of close American
                            support for Iran against Iraq, but he might not be very responsive to
                            U.S. counsels of moderation. However, U.S. success in dealing with the
                            problems postulated here would be fundamentally conditioned by the
                            status of the international effort to promote a political settlement of
                            the Arab-Israel dispute.</p>
                        <p>A factor hard to evaluate in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations is the
                            internal situation in Iran. While there is little doubt that the Shah's
                            "White Revolution" has fragmented the former opposition, leftist
                            revolutionary youth groups have become active in the country. The
                            dimensions of the dissidence are difficult to assess. As long as the
                            Shah controls the security apparatus of the state, chances for a
                            successful movement against his rule are probably small. Should he
                            depart from the scene, whether through violence or natural causes, the
                            position of the Pahlevi regime is likely to become much more precarious.
                            Even if there is an orderly transfer of power, the new ruler will lack
                            the Shah's prestige and experience, and the direction Iran may take
                            under new leadership is impossible to foresee.</p>

                        <p>Summary 1. On 14 February 1971, Iran and other Persian Gulf members of
                            the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>) won an agreement from the private
                            oil companies to pay substantially larger revenues through 1975. The
                            agreement came at a time when Iran's foreign reserves had fallen
                            dangerously low and when the balance of payments was under severe
                            pressure because of heavy imports and costly debt repayments associated
                            with the Shah's military and economic development programs. While these
                            programs had greatly enlarged Iran's military capabilities and sparked
                            an impressive 10% average annual growth of the economy, this continued
                            expansion was threatened by inadequate foreign exchange receipts.</p>
                        <p>2. Largely as an outgrowth of the February agreement, however, Iran's
                            balance-of-payments outlook has brightened considerably. Oil revenues —
                            some 80% of export earnings—probably will triple during fiscal years
                            1971-75 (1) in comparison with those of the previous five years. With
                            these and other export earnings—plus expected foreign loans—Iran should
                            be able simultaneously to continue its 10% growth rate, to expand its
                            military establishment, and generally to increase its foreign
                            reserves.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (1) The Iranian fiscal year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>) begins on or about 21 March of the year stated, in

                        <p>3. Since the mid-1960s, Iran has incurred generally increasing current
                            account deficits. Although receipts rose from some $700 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d165-03" facs="d165-03"/>1964 to $1.7 billion in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970, imports increased even
                            faster and the current account deficit mounted from $45 million to $762
                            million (see the chart and Table 1). Since foreign reserves were not
                            large to begin with, these deficits were covered mainly by long-term
                            foreign borrowing.</p>
                        <p>[Chart: Iran: Balance-of-Payments Current Account]</p>

                        <p>4. Imports grew rapidly as a result of the Shah's forced-draft programs
                            of economic and military development. Dissatisfied with the economy's 4%
                            growth rate during the early 1960s, the Shah sharply increased public
                            investment and encouraged private investment. In response, government
                            investment nearly quadrupled between <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1964 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969, reaching an estimated
                            $1.1 billion, while private investment almost doubled, to about $1
                            billion. Investment rose from 15% to 23% of gross national product
                                (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) in only five years, and real
                            economic growth increased to an average of about 10% annually.</p>

                        <p>5. Because of the country's limited production capabilities, imports
                            increased an average of 21% annually. About one-third of economic
                            development spending went for imports in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 1968-70. Defense and defense-related imports (which are
                            believed to make up much or all of the balance-of- payments item "other
                            government agencies”) accounted for an even larger share of defense
                            spending. Arms imports alone have amounted to about 30% of defense
                            spending in recent years, while other defense and defense-related
                            imports (construction materials, equipment, and supplies for military
                            bases, factories, and other military installations) possibly increased
                            the share to 50%. As a result, public sector imports increased ninefold,
                            while private sector imports doubled. By FY 1970, the public sector
                            accounted for about half of total imports, contrasted with less than
                            one-sixth in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964.</p>
                        <p>6. Imports of machinery, component parts, and raw materials have
                            increased in line with Iran's rapid industrial growth, much of which has
                            taken the form of simple processing and assembly-type operations. The
                            import content of final products is more than 80% for such industries as
                            motor vehicles, tires, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic fibers, and it is
                            also fairly high in some other industries. Much of the industrial
                            expansion had the aim of import-substitution in the consumer goods
                            field. The value of finished consumer goods imports remained relatively
                            constant, and its share of estimated non-defense imports declined from
                            about 23% in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 to roughly 10% in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970. However, when account is
                            taken of the import content of locally produced consumer goods it seems
                            clear that total consumer-related imports have increased.</p>
                        <p>7. Export earnings grew by an average of 16% yearly from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1970—an impressive expansion, although decidedly slower than for
                            imports. Oil export revenues(2) increased from $479 million to $1,148
                            million—mainly because of a 15% average annual rise in volume (see Table
                            2)—but oil's share of total exports dropped slightly. The rapid growth
                            of Iran's oil exports—almost double the rate for other Middle Eastern
                            countries—reflects both the increased output that Tehran persuaded the
                            producers' consortium to undertake and the greatly expanded market for
                            Iranian oil, notably in Japan. Meanwhile Iran's non-oil exports also
                            grew at a brisk rate. Although exports still are dominated by three
                            traditional product categories—carpets, cotton, and fruits and
                            nuts—there have been growing sales of industrial goods such as vehicles,
                            tires, footwear, chemicals, textiles, knitwear, and soap. Most of these
                            products have gone to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            other bilateral trading partners where quality and price are not the
                            major considerations.</p>

                            earnings. These net earnings are equated with the government's share of

                        <p>8. To finance its rapidly growing current account deficits, Iran relied
                            mainly on foreign loans. Credit drawdowns mounted from a scant $28
                            million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 to $952 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970, when they equaled 56% of
                            current account receipts. Repayment obligations consequently increased
                            sharply. Debt servicing payments rose from 9% of current account
                            receipts in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 to 20% in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970, when principal and interest totaled
                            $346 million. Although net foreign private investment has increased in
                            recent years, it was only 5% of the net capital inflow in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970.</p>
                        <p>9. Despite growing recourse to foreign credits, Iran's foreign reserves
                            have been under periodic pressure since the mid-1960s, at times equaling
                            as little as one month's imports. Even greater borrowing abroad—or a
                            disastrous drop in reserves—was avoided only by obtaining special <pb n="7" xml:id="d165-07" facs="d165-07"/>payments from the oil
                            companies in the mid-1960s and again in recent years. In the first case,
                            the companies made special payments of nearly $200 million for
                            concessions granted in 1965, and in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1969 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 they were prevailed on
                            to make advance payments (in effect, forced short -term loans) of some
                            $100 million. Immediately prior to the February 1971 oil settlement,
                            reserves were only $222 million — the equivalent of slightly over one
                            month's imports.</p>

                        <p>10. The outlook for Iran's foreign exchange earnings improved
                            considerably in early 1971, when the private oil producers agreed to
                            make substantially larger payments to Iran and other Persian Gulf
                            members of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. The terms of the 14
                            February agreement were largely an outgrowth of Tehran's forceful role
                            in the negotiations. As it applied to Iran, the agreement affirmed the
                            tax-rate increase on net income (from 50% to 55%) that had been agreed
                            to temporarily in November 1970, provided an immediate increase of 21%
                            (or 38 cents per barrel) in the posted price on which taxes are based,
                            and stipulated regular increases in the posted price during 1971-75 to
                            offset worldwide inflation. The inflation adjustment provided for
                            increases of 2.5% annually plus an additional 5 cents per barrel
                            effective I June 1971 and on the first of the year in 1973 through 1975.
                            In all, the February 1971 agreement called for Iran's revenue per barrel
                            of exported oil to increase by an average of 9.5% yearly, from 87 cents
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 to $1.37 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975. Because the volume of oil exports
                            was expected to double, oil export earnings during the period were
                            expected to increase from $1.1 billion to $3.6 billion.</p>
                        <p>11. Prospective oil revenues during the next several years were boosted
                            another 8.5% by the 20 January 1972 agreement that Persian Gulf members
                            of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> negotiated with the oil
                            companies.(3) The countries demanded a revenue adjustment to offset the
                            higher costs of imports caused by the recent changes in world currency
                            values. Because its oil revenues are computed in US dollars and paid in
                            sterling at the official exchange rate, Iran faced increased costs for
                            imports from countries that revalued their currencies against the
                            dollar—notably Japan and most West European nations. For Iran's imports,
                            the weighted average increase in cost is estimated to be 8%. The
                            devaluation adjustment of 20 January further raises Iran's expected
                            average revenue per barrel and total oil earnings during the several
                            years to the levels shown in Table 3. Total oil revenues during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 1971-75 will amount to an estimated $14
                            billion—triple those of the preceding five years. [footnote] (3) For

                        <p>12. A decided improvement in Iran's balance of payments is occurring in
                            the current fiscal year, largely because of the sharply increased oil
                            earnings. The oil sector is expected to contribute about $2.2
                            billion—including returns from sales of local currency to oil
                            companies—to current account receipts in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 (see Table 4). This is approximately $900 million
                            more than last year and $200 million more than Iran initially
                            anticipated from the February 1971 agreement. The additional $200
                            million reflects mainly a fortuitous decline in shipping costs, brought
                            on by a surplus of charter oil carriers. This cost reduction made
                            Persian Gulf oil cheaper than that produced in the Mediterranean area
                            and resulted in greater-than-expected gains in Iranian oil exports.
                            Iran, moreover, is getting an additional $24 million this fiscal year
                            from increased port dues on oil carriers and from other provisions that
                            the Shah exacted from the oil companies in July 1971.</p>

                        <p>13. In addition to the estimated $2.2 billion from the oil sector, Iran
                            is expected to earn about $300 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 from non-oil exports, compared with $261 million
                            the previous year. During the first five months, non-oil exports were
                            running at an annual level of about $274 million, exclusive of gas
                            shipments which should amount to at least $30 million. Freight,
                            insurance, and other service earnings probably will provide about $200
                            million. Total current account receipts, therefore, will probably amount
                            to about $2.7 billion.</p>
                        <p>14. Iran's current account payments in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1971 are estimated to be $3.0 billion. This assumes a 19% rise in
                            non-defense imports (which Iran's recent experience suggests would
                            attend a 10% gain in real <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) plus a
                            small upward adjustment to reflect the impact during the last part of
                            the year of the international currency adjustments. Imports of
                            defense-related commodities and other items are estimated at some $600
                            million—up from $500 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1970—on the basis of the defense budget. Service payments are projected
                            at $485 million, about $100 million more than in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970.</p>
                        <p>15. If the foregoing projections are realized, Iran will have a current
                            account deficit in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 of $330
                            million—less than in any year since <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1967. The World Bank has estimated credit drawdowns of about $750
                            million and repayments of about $315 million, which—with expected net
                            private investment of $40 million—indicates net capital receipts of $475
                            million. Although the net capital inflow thus is expected to be well
                            below the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 level of about $740
                            million, Tehran has a good chance of covering the current account
                            deficit and raising reserves substantially. This conclusion is supported
                            by the upward trend of reserves through December 1971.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outlook Through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1975</p>
                        <p>16. Projection of Iran's balance of payments through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975 suggests that the country's foreign
                            exchange position will probably improve even though very rapid import
                            growth is in prospect. We estimate that Iran's net receipts from the oil
                            sector will increase by about 90% between <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975. Non-oil
                            exports should continue to grow by at least 15% yearly, and earnings
                            from services can be expected to expand at about the same rate. Total
                            current account receipts accordingly are projected to rise from $2.7
                            billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 to about $5.0 billion
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975—an average annual gain of
                            17%.</p>
                        <p>17. Current account payments during the period are expected to increase
                            by an average of about 13% yearly. It is assumed that imports of
                            non-defense items will bear the same relationship as in the past to
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, which is projected to expand
                            about 10% yearly as planned. The estimated <pb n="11" xml:id="d165-11" facs="d165-11"/>imports have been adjusted by the average weighted
                            percentage increase in cost of 8% resulting from currency revisions by
                            Iran's trading partners. The increase in costs during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 1971-75, estimated at nearly $1 billion,
                            essentially washes out the projected gains in oil revenue resulting from
                            the January 1972 agreement.</p>
                        <p>18. Although some increase in defense imports is anticipated in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972, it is assumed that they
                            subsequently will level off and probably not exceed about $750 million
                            annually. This assumption does not appear unwarranted, given the already
                            large military buildup and the further enlargement and upgrading of the
                            arms inventory that could be accomplished at this projected import
                            level. Although Iran appears concerned over the high cost of defense(4)
                            and has called for more balance in defense and development spending, our
                            assumption regarding defense imports could be vitiated by policy changes
                            or by military hostilities involving Iran.</p>
                        <p>(4) Defense obviously has held back economic development efforts in the
                            past. If allowed to grow at recent rates, it could absorb at least a
                            quarter of Iran's <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> by 1975.</p>
                        <p>19. Should current account receipts and payments rise as projected, Iran
                            would gradually eliminate its deficit and have a surplus in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975. Credit drawdowns are estimated at
                            $750 million annually — the upper level of a $700-$750 million range
                            cited by the World Bank as attainable on reasonable credit terms. Debt
                            repayments (principal and interest) consistent with such drawdowns and
                            existing debt are expected to rise gradually and by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975 should approximate the credit
                            inflows. The net inflow of private investment is expected to continue to
                            increase by roughly $10 million annually, reaching $80 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975. Although net capital inflows are
                            expected to decline somewhat, the amount probably will remain
                            substantial. These receipts, coupled with gradual improvements in the
                            current account balance, should enable Iran to have a surplus in its
                            balance of payments and increasing foreign exchange holdings in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975.</p>

                        <p>For the past year, the Shah has been interested in obtaining some sort of
                            sophisticated missile for his F-4s. He first sought the SHRIKE and a
                            study on developing an Anti-<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            capability for the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> was prepared by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> and briefed to him on 17
                            November 1971. As a result of the briefing, he decided not to buy
                            SHRIKE, but indicated a high interest in MAVERICK (see Tab A). The
                            Country Team strongly supports this request pointing out that Shah is
                            aware of our decision to equip <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            forces with MAVERICK and refusal to release MAVERICK to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would undoubtedly create serious
                            adverse reaction and injure our military relationship which is key to
                            US-Iran relations and vital interests in Iran and Persian Gulf. The
                            Country Team further points out that the Shah, as a result of the SHRIKE
                            briefing, is most anxious to develop military planning rationally and in
                            consideration of all relevant factors. Therefore our full cooperation,
                            as in the case of the SHRIKE, not only reinforces our rapport and
                            strengthens ties, but also permits a careful evaluation of the system
                            and the integration of the system into the overall military development
                            effort.</p>
                        <p> USCINCEUR strongly indorses the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            request (see Tab B). He points out that the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> has the capability to absorb, maintain and employ the
                            MAVERICK, and believes it to be in the best interest of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to provide <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with the requested data on MAVERICK and thereby
                            contribute to the capability of a most important military force which
                            seeks to preserve the stability and protect free world interests in the
                            important Persian Gulf oil producing area.</p>
                        <p>On 5 October 1971, you requested <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to
                            prepare an evaluation of the advisability of extending a US offer of
                            both ROCK EYE and MAVERICK missiles to our allies. The Director, Defense
                            Research and Engineering, was also requested to make an evaluation of
                            the advisability of this action from the viewpoint of promoting the
                            military strength of the US and its allies (see Tab C).</p>

                        <p>On 3 November 1971, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering
                            recommended that consideration of offering MAVERICK to our allies be
                            deferred until further operational testing in a realistic battlefield
                            environment had been conducted and results analyzed (see Tab D).</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in answering your memorandum on
                            26 November 1971 stated they consider it in the best interest of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to offer the MAVERICK to all
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations which have tactical
                            air units committed to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. They
                            suggested that separate requests by other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations be considered on a case-by-case basis (see Tab
                            E).</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> has estimated that if the
                            missile is offered for sale outside the US, the first 50 missiles could
                            be delivered by January 1974; 200 missiles per month would be available
                            by January 1975 and 1,000 missiles per month by January 1976. These
                            quantities would be for export and are over and above present <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> requirements. (USN has indicated they
                            are not interested in this missile at this time). Under present planning
                            Iran would probably not be in line for initial equipping until sometime
                            in late 1974 or early 1975. There are at least two factors which would
                            bear on this time table. The first is the number of missiles bought by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>. We understand that the Air
                            Force has ordered 9,000 missiles but the buy could go as high as
                            15-17,000. The second factor is the production capacity by <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName> or other contractors who could
                            be brought into the production picture at a later date. If the policy
                            decision to release the weapon to countries outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is made soon, indications are that
                            foreign requirements for 30-35,000 missiles could be filled by 1977.</p>
                        <p>In assessing all the information available on the MAVERICK, I have
                            concluded that the economic and political factors outweigh the
                            disadvantage of compromise of the missile in the 3-4 year future time
                            frame. The foreign market is estimated at 33,000 missiles or $660
                            million in military sales. There is favorable advantage to US
                            international balance of payments deficit and larger production would
                            lower the unit cost to <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> and
                            amortize RDT&amp;<gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> costs. In addition, the
                            release of the MAVERICK would make significant contribution to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. Moreover, in
                            keeping with our spirit of full cooperation with Iran, it would seem
                            that to be forthcoming this matter would go a long way in showing the
                            Shah our real intent to provide him first-rate military equipment along
                            with our other allies.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the logic of world-wide release, there is also logic in
                            your policy as enunciated to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on 9
                            December 1971. That policy was <pb n="3" xml:id="d166-03" facs="d166-03"/>aimed at determining conclusively that the MAVERICK would perform
                            according to its specifications. However, that policy is also being
                            construed as inhibiting any further dialogue with potential foreign
                            customers until successful completion of these tests. The effect of this
                            has been to deter many nations from developing an interest in purchasing
                            the missile once the decision to release it has been made by the US.
                            Further delay in providing information to Iran could very well result in
                            the loss of military sales worth many millions of dollars. Another
                            consideration is the long lead time required by a foreign government to
                            evaluate and place the order which would dictate that the earlier the
                            information is released the more probable we could place the missile in
                            the field to meet the tactical requirements extant in 1975.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the problem of immediate concern is the release of
                            non-sensitive (confidential, promotional) data not only to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries but to other selected
                            allied nations. The Air Force and <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName> have prepared a brochure (draft attached at Tab
                            F). It would seem appropriate that this brochure, once cleared by Air
                            Force disclosure authorities, could be distributed to various potential
                            customers on a case-by-case basis with the clearly stated caveat that
                            availability of the missile for sale would depend on the final outcome
                            of the operational testing. These data, properly caveated, would
                            accelerate decision-making process of several interested nations if
                            released now but would not unduly commit the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to the sale of the missile. If you agree with this I
                            will advise the Air Force to proceed with the release.</p>
                        <p>APPROVE [MSL]</p>
                        <p>DISAPPROVE</p>
                        <p>I believe a good case has been made for sale of this missile to Iran, and
                            could be made for many other non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. I, therefore, recommend that you expand your policy to
                            approve the release of MAVERICK for sale to Iran as well as to other
                            allied countries on a case-by-case basis. This, of course, is contingent
                            upon the successful operational testing; no commitment on availability
                            of the missiles would be made until <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> needs are fulfilled as well as those <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations with committed tactical air
                            forces.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d166-04" facs="d166-04"/>
                        <p>If you approve this policy as recommended, then MAVERICK would be
                            authorized for sale to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries,
                            Iran, and, within the scope of the National Disclosure Policy, to other
                                non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries which are
                            strategically important to US defense planning and formally allied with
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>APPROVE [Would hope to give favorable consideration to such a sale after

                        <p>28 February 1972<lb/> [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>1. The local press of 27 and 28 February carry front page articles
                            announcing mass rallies and demonstrations organized by the National
                            Defense Committee, composed of all groups, parties, and guilds, to be
                            held in Tehran and provinces Tuesday, February 29, to answer all foreign
                            enemies, provocators and agents of imperialists. The press is careful in
                            mentioning imperialists and refers to regimes such as the Baathist
                            Government in Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>2. All shops, private businesses, industries, universities and schools
                            will be closed Tuesday until mid-day to allow people to join mass
                            protest rallies and demonstrations. Government offices will remain open.
                            The Majlis cancelled the Tuesday session so that the members can
                            participate in the rallies.</p>
                        <p>3. The major rally, an all day affair, is to be held in Tehran Sepah
                            Square in the bazaar area, about one and one-half miles south of the
                            Embassy. (We also learn another big rally is scheduled to be held in the
                            sports stadium one block east of the Embassy Compound.)</p>
                        <p>4. Over the past several months a number of more or less chronic causes
                            of popular dissatisfaction have taken on a considerably sharper edge.
                            The likelihood of a change in Prime Ministers—which until now [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] has consistently assessed
                            as scant—appears at this point to be a real possibility—if only as a sop
                            to public discontent. As a guess, Jamahid Amuzagar would be a good bet
                            as <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>'s successor.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d168-02" facs="d168-02"/>
                        <p>5. The following factors lead to this conclusion:</p>
                        <p>A. The cost of food—food which provides the diet of the poor and medium
                            income group—has about doubled in the past year. Many who could afford
                            meat or fish once a week last year cannot afford it at all this year.
                            Wages have increased, but not proportionately. Thus there is a real
                            squeeze on a large proportion of the population. Last week the Minister
                            of Agriculture—without consulting the Prime Minister—announced large
                            increases in meat prices. Public disapproval was immediately manifested
                            to a degree which [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] alarmed
                            the Prime Minister enough to impel him to telephone the Shah to request
                            and obtain the Shah's approval to reverse the Minister of Agriculture's
                            announcement. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], meat
                            prices, which shot up of owing the first announcement, have not returned
                            to their previous levels despite the reversal and there is still serious
                            discontent. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] distribution
                            of meat and most other foods is controlled and exploited by men in
                            responsible positions in government. This is known to the consumers who
                            therefore not only hold the government responsible for the price rises
                            but also for corruption in this area which is a vital part of their
                            lives.</p>
                        <p>B. The clergy, which is always antigovernment, is much more so today than
                            in the past three years. There are two specific current issues; the
                            government effort to establish a religious corps and recent government
                            arrest of a very prominent Ayatollah followed by the distribution of
                            photographs which show him in rather strenuous sexual activity with a
                            young woman. The result of all this has been to engender widespread
                            antigovernment feeling coupled with a sympathy toward the clergy even
                            among those who normally care very little.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d168-03" facs="d168-03"/>
                        <p>C. Public disapproval of corruption in government has also become more
                            widespread as it affects increasing numbers of people in their daily
                            lives. While there have always been chronic complainers, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] hear of more and more
                            specific examples from persons who cite what we feel reasonably certain
                            are accurate incidents. For example, a senior military officer who
                            certainly represents the loyal government employee recently expressed
                            incredulity at the extent of disorder and impersonal inefficiency in the
                            Ministry of Justice which can be overcome only by the use of bribes.</p>
                        <p>D. Urban guerrilla activity has attracted some public sympathy and even
                            admiration because it provides for many a vicarious expression of the
                            resentments which they have but do not dare express. Recent trials have
                            resulted in convictions which include some death sentences. (It is very
                            difficult to determine the exact number from press accounts—probably 5
                            or 6.) While many arrests have been made, we doubt that anything like a
                            total wrap up has been achieved. It is not possible to put this factor
                            into the equation with any precision, but it seems reasonable to
                            estimate that if the executions are carried out while the present
                            situation prevails, this will contribute to the general anti-government
                            disposition of the people.</p>
                        <p>E. Government foreign policy is subject to widespread criticism because
                            it is believed to result in a continuing tension between Iran and its
                            Arab neighbors. Many people believe that this tension is used by the
                            government as the excuse to procure expensive military equipment using
                            funds which could better be spent to remedy fundamental domestic
                            ills.</p>
                        <p>6. Today's press carries announcements of a mass rally to be held on 29
                            February. If our estimate is correct, there will be little enthusiasm
                            for it. There will also be groups—the clergy, bazaar, and possibly urban
                            guerrilla—which may seek to turn the assembled mass toward issues for
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d168-04" facs="d168-04"/>which it would have
                            enthusiasm. We cannot predict the upshot for there are aspects about
                            which we know too little. [<hi rend="italic">text not

                                reported that as the demonstrations ended, the government announced
                                the executions of six anti-government dissidents. (Ibid.) At this
                                time, the 120 Iranians accused of terrorism were facing military
                                tribunals. Donald Toussaint of the Embassy noted to <persName corresp="#p_MJC3">Jack Miklos</persName> on March 28 that “there

                                groups, and some members of each group apparently did engage in acts
                                of terrorism. While, in general, the entire membership of a group is

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MJC3">Jack</persName>:</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned to you on the phone last night (or was it this morning) I
                            was summoned back this morning by General <persName corresp="#p_AGR1">Azimi</persName>, the Minister of War, for a report on the status
                            of <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>'s request for a squadron of F-4Es
                            in 1972. Believe it or not, I think the General probably hoped to have
                            an answer to the request, put to us most recently last week. A telegram
                            will be on its way to you today reporting on the conversation. The
                            purpose of this is to give you some of the atmospherics.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, this question of F-4Es in 1972 is now uppermost in the Shah's
                            mind and has become Problem No. 1 with us. He sees this as an article of
                            faith in his concept of his relationship with the US, feeling that when
                            the chips are down and his need is great we will cooperate with him and
                            be responsive — even though we may disagree with his assumptions,
                            conclusions and needs.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of any clear state of play on the F-4E production line in
                            1972 and future years, i.e., how many are going to the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> and to other countries, the line I
                            have taken with the General is that since Iran's own production schedule
                            can't be speeded up and the company can only find 11 F-4Es out of its
                            own production for delivery in early 1973 but not before, the only way
                            we can respond to the Shah's request is to take these planes from some
                            other country or out of our own hide. This raises many <pb n="2" xml:id="d170-02" facs="d170-02"/>problems regarding priorities,
                            relations with other countries, etc. Therefore, in order to strengthen
                            the case it is of vital importance that there be no professional doubt
                            about Iran's capacity to absorb this squadron in 1972, and as of now
                            both <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">Armish/Maag</gloss> and General
                            Khatemi of the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> have such
                            doubts.</p>
                        <p>This has gotten pretty bloody because General <persName corresp="#p_AGR1">Azimi</persName> stated flatly last week to me and repeated again
                            today that it was his professional judgment that this could be done, and
                            he was unaware of any reservations by <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">Armish/Maag</gloss> or General Khatemi. Unfortunately, the good
                            General has not been clued in and is out on a limb, but as a result of
                            this morning's meeting at which I persuaded him to review the matter I
                            hope this can be straightened out.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the result of this review, the fact remains that the Shah has
                            officially asked us for a squadron in 1972 and that is the reality we
                            must address. I suspect that because of his concerns about production
                            lines and other delays the Shah would prefer to have a squadron here in
                            storage than promised later on.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, and as an indication of how closely the Shah is following
                            this — as he always does — he picked up a comment I had made last week
                            which was in a report to him to the effect that the recent loss of two
                            F-4s and one F-5 because of reported pilot error indicated what could
                            happen if the Air Force was pushed too hard, and this morning the
                            General said the Shah had directed him to tell me that the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss>'s record was outstanding and a lot
                            better than both the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> and the
                            German Air Force, and in effect to knock it off.</p>
                        <p>One occasionally picks up a bruise or two around here representing our
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>There is little doubt in my mind that if matters are delayed that long
                            the Shah will get a favorable response in May, but I would hope that we
                            could avoid all the bruises, bitterness and anguish that such a delay
                            would entail. <pb n="3" xml:id="d170-03" facs="d170-03"/>At a minimum I
                            would hope that I could be instructed very soon to tell the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that in principle we accept the Shah's
                            request for a squadron in 1972, and we are actively engaged in seeing

                        <p>1. VIRTUALLY AS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS AFTER SHAH RETURNED TO IRAN FEB
                            29, CHARGE WAS CALLED TO MINISTRY OF WAR MORNING MARCH 1 AND ASKED BY
                            MINISTER FOR STATUS REPORT ON SHAH'S REQUEST FOR DELIVERY OF SIXTEEN
                            F-4E AIRCRAFT IN <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972. IN ABSENCE
                            RESPONSE FROM DEPARTMENT TO PREVIOUS MESSAGES OR REPORT ON STATUS

                            CHARGE RESPONDED AS FOLLOWS.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH'S REQUEST HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED TO WASHINGTON BUT CONSIDERATION
                            AND DECISION WOULD OBVIOUSLY TAKE SOME TIME. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> OFFICIALS WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE OUR THINKING WITH AND
                            GIVE CURRENT REPORT TO GEN <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">TOUFANIAN</persName> WHEN HE RETURNED TO WASHINGTON AROUND MARCH
                            12.</p>
                        <p>3. WE UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR TECHNICAL AND OTHER REASONS PRODUCTION LINE FOR
                            IRAN COULD NOT BE ADVANCED TO MAKE DELIVERIES IN 1972. IF CORRECT, THIS
                            MEANT OPTIONS FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WERE LIMITED

                            $40 MILLION AND WITH DELIVERY IN EARLY AND MID 1973. GEN <persName corresp="#p_AGR1">AZIMI</persName> SAID HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN
                            INFORMED OF OFFER BUT WOULD LOOK INTO IT.</p>
                        <p>B. DIVERSION TO IRAN OF AIRCRAFT SLATED FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. EMBASSY HAD
                            NO INFO AS TO AVAILABILITY. BUT THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO AT BEST,
                            AND CONSIDERATION AND DECISION, REQUIRING NEGOTIATIONS, ETC WOULD TAKE
                            TIME. IRAN FOR INSTANCE, WOULD NOT LOOK FAVORABLY ON <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> DIVERSION OF AIRCRAFT SLATED FOR IT TO
                            THIRD-COUNTRY. GEN <persName corresp="#p_AGR1">AZIMI</persName>
                            COMMENTED THAT IN VIEW OF REGIONAL SITUATION HE WAS OPTIMISTIC IRAN'S

                        <p>C. SUPPLY TO IRAN FROM AIRCRAFT DESTINED FOR OR IN HANDS OF <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>. AGAIN WE HAD NO INFO AS TO
                            AVAILABILITY, COMPATABILITY, ETC AND SUCH DECISION WOULD REQUIRE HARD
                            REVIEW AS <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> DID NOT HAVE F-4ES IN

                            SIXTEEN F-4ES IN 1972. CHARGE'S RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> INDICATED THAT US MILITARY ADVISORY
                            VIEW WAS THAT EIGHT F-4ES WERE MAXIMUM <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> COULD EFFECTIVELY PUT TO USE IN 1972 AND THEN ONLY IF

                            IN 1972 OF TWO SQUADRONS OFC-130 (SOME OF WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE STORED)
                            AND ONE SQUADRON F-27 AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS PEACE RUBY MANNING WOULD PUT
                            SERIOUS STRAIN ON IIAF TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. GREATER ACCELERATION, IN
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> VIEW, RISKED DEGRADING RATHER

                        <p>5. GEN <persName corresp="#p_AGR1">AZIMI</persName> COMMENTED THAT SHAH,
                            IN ANSWER TO REPORT ON PREVIOUS MEETING WITH CHARGE HAD NOTED THAT

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGR1">AZIMI</persName> SAID HE WAS SURPRISED
                            AT <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> VIEW AS HE HAD BEEN INFORMED
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> AGREED WITH PREVIOUS
                            ACCELERATION PROPOSALS. HE SAID HE WOULD DIRECT THAT <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> GET TOGETHER WITH <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> TO REVIEW QUESTION. AT SAME TIME,
                            HOWEVER, HE WANTED CHARGE TO KNOW HE WAS FULLY CONFIDENT <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> COULD EFFECTIVELY ABSORB ALL AIRCRAFT

                        <p>6. CHARGE SAID EMBASSY AND UG SHARED IRANIAN VIEW THAT <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> WAS HIGH PERFORMANCE OUTFIT. WE ALSO
                            RECOGNIZED THAT DECISIONS ON EQUIPMENT ACQUISITIONS WERE PREROGATIVE OF

                            THUS WE WERE CONCERNED AT EFFECTS OF ACCELERATION. IRAN'S REQUEST FOR

                        <p>The Honorable<lb/> J. W. Fulbright<lb/> Chairman<lb/> Committee on
                            Foreign Relations<lb/> United States Senate</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                        <p>I am replying to your letter of February 10, 1972, requesting further
                            information about Presidential Determination 72-10 authorizing the use
                            of $942,000 in grant military assistance to Iran.</p>
                        <p>As explained in the Memorandum to the President, dated November 22, 1971,
                            which was forwarded with the State Department's report to Congress on
                            February 8, we believe it is important to U.S. interests that Iran
                            continue to develop as a strong, stable and reliable friend in the
                            turbulent Middle East area. Iranian cooperation is important not only to
                            our efforts to achieve peaceful solutioms to the current problems of
                            this region, but also to the prevention of further instability and
                            growth of polential conflicts after the recent withdrawal of British
                            forces from the Persian Gulf area. We remain convinced that our modest
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program contributes to the
                            achievement of these objectives. We do not believe this justification is
                            affected by the manner in which the government of Iran chose to
                            celebrate a most important occasion in the history of that nation.</p>
                        <p>As Iran has developed a greater capability to pay for military equipment
                            and services, we have reduced our grant assistance program in
                            commensurate measure. From a level of $2.4 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971, we went to a level of $942,000 for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 and we are projecting a
                            further reduction to about $500,000 for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973. Of the $942,000 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972, approximately $287,000 was provided for support of
                            the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Iran, while the balance
                            of about $655,000 was provided for actual costs of training. Although
                            the Iranian Government purchased an amount of about $5 million in <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> training during <pb n="2" xml:id="d172-02" facs="d172-02"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972, we feel that we should continue
                            to provide modest amounts of training without reimbursement in certain
                            areas which we feel important from the viewpoint of U.S. interests but
                            which do not rate high priority with Iranian planners. It should also be
                            noted that Iran contributes approximately $1.6 million annually in
                            support of our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> activities in that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Export-Import Bank financing of military sales to Iran, a
                            program of $140 million was approved for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. The potential items to be covered by this credit
                            include F-4 aircraft, with supporting equipment and services. This
                            credit includes $70 million to be privately financed with Eximbank
                            guaranty. For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973, a program of $200
                            million, including $100 million to be privately financed with ERximbank
                            guaranty, has been proposed. Estimated requirements include F-4 aircraft
                            and supporting equipment, C-130 aircraft, M-47 tank retrofit program,
                            helicopters and spares.</p>
                        <p>If there is any further information regarding this matter which you
                            believe we might provide, please let me know. We would, of course, be
                            prepared to go into this matter further in a personal briefing for you
                            or members of the Committee's staff if you so desire.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>For the past two months, the Shah has been increasing the pressure on us
                            for accelerated delivery of F-4E aircraft in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972. The present delivery schedule for the fifth
                            through eighth squadrons commences in July 1973. Until recently the Shah
                            has insisted upon acceleration of one squadron of these aircraft into
                                <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972 but he now has expressed
                            willingness to settle for only eight aircraft on the basis that they
                            will replace the six F-4Ds which will soon be out for overhaul plus the
                            two F-4s lost by attrition.</p>
                        <p>Periodically, the Shah seizes one issue on which he takes an almost
                            obsessive view. This seems to be one of those issues and one which we
                            believe he will take to the White House if we refuse to offer him at
                            least something. We have been working with the Air Force and
                                MCDONNELL-<persName>Douglas</persName> to determine alternate
                            solutions. Unless we turn him down entirely, only two options affording
                                <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972 delivery appear viable:
                            diversion from 1972 production scheduled for <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> or a lease similar to the Australian arrangement.</p>
                        <p>In the attached memorandum, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SRCJ1">Seamans</persName> argues that the best solution to the problem is
                            to arrange to lease eight (8) F-4s on a temporary basis and on the
                            condition that Iran arrange with the manufacturer to accelerate to the
                            maximum, at their expense, delivery of aircraft in 1973. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRCJ1">Seamans</persName> concludes that to
                            divert 1972 production aircraft would involve exceedingly difficult
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>We share Secretary Seamans' concern about this diversion of American
                            military assets. While eight airplanes obviously cannot be considered as
                            seriously endangering our military position, the situation appears in a
                            different light when recognized as an extension of the much larger
                            diversions that have been made for Israel which have already set the Air
                            Force programing back substantially. When considered in connection <pb n="2" xml:id="d175-02" facs="d175-02"/>with the probabilities of
                            similar pressures for the same kind of special consideration for the
                            Greeks and Turks in the near future, the danger that the extension of
                            the policy of diversion for Israel to another country setting the stage
                            for further similar reduction of our capabilities to enhance those of
                            other Near East countries does present a real military risk.
                            Nevertheless, in the light of the Shah's past history, we have concluded
                            that the only course is to accede to his insistence which we believe has
                            been minimized at the eight figure, but do so reluctantly and with the
                            full intention not to let this set a precedent for further action of
                            this kind. If we must supply the eight airplanes, Secretary Seamans'
                            proposal appears to us to be the least damaging way to do it. The
                            Government of Iran will pay full rent for the use of the aircraft based
                            on a percentage of the acquisition price.</p>
                        <p>If you agree that we must meet the Shah's request, I will so inform the
                            Air Force. We also plan to inform Lieutenant General <persName corresp="#p_TLGH1">Toufanian</persName>, Iran's procurement chief,
                            who is now visiting the U.S. at the Shah's behest, of the Air Force

                        <p>SUMMARY. DESPITE REQUIRED 15 PER CENT <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> REDUCTION WORLDWIDE, COUNTRY TEAM BELIEVES COMPELLING
                            REASONS EXIST FOR INCREASE IN PRESENT <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> COMPLEMENT TO MEET LONG UNANSWERED REQUEST OF
                            SHAH. SHAH SEES MILITARY COOPERATION AS MAJOR BENEFIT HE GETS FROM
                            RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISORY MISSION IS KEY ELEMENT IN THIS COOPERATION.
                            IT IS UNDERMANNED AT TIME <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MILITARY
                            MODERNIZATION REQUIRES ADVISORY AUGMENTATION. UNLESS <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> IS ADEQUATELY STAFFED TO PERFORM
                            CREDIBLE AND REPONSIBLE ADVISORY ROLE, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
                            TRUST AND RELIANCE OF SHAH AND IRANIAN MILITARY NOR MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS
                            FOR SUPPORT OF MAJOR US EQUIPMENT SALES TO IRAN. INEVITABLE RESULT WILL
                            BE EROSION OF PRIMARY ADVISORY ROLE OF <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> AND INCREASED 3RD COUNTRY MILITARY INFLuENcE
                            AND SALES WITH EXPECTABLE LOSSES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE WHICH WILL MORE
                            THAN OFFSET ANY GAINS FROM MAAGSAVINGS. WE CAN ALSO EXPECT LOOSENING OF
                            US-IRAN TIES AND LESSENING OF REAL BENEFITS US <pb n="2" xml:id="d176-02" facs="d176-02"/>RECEIVES FROM RELATIONS WITH IRAN.
                            FURTHERMORE, UNDER EUCOM PLAN TO TAKE OVER <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ADMIN SUPPORT, INCREASE OF 36 ADVISORY POSITIONS
                            PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED MAY BE POSSIBLE WITHIN OVERALL <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> PERSONNEL REDUCTION OF
                            MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT. <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> HAS
                            PROPOSED THAT IT TAKE OVER DIRECTLY ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT
                            RESPONSIBILITIES FOR <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> UNITS IN IRAN
                            WHICH NOW BEING CARRIED OUT BY <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> SUPPORT ELEMENT. THIS WOULD REDUCE MAAG
                            STRENGTH BY SOME 120 US POSITIONS, AND LEAVE ADEQUATE ROOM FOR ADVISORY
                            AUGMENTATION. ACTION REQUESTED. DEPARTMENT'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR
                            COMPLEMENT INCREASE IS REQUESTED. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. EVEN IN FACT OF CONGRESSIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR WORLD-WIDE <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> COMPLEMENT REDUCTIONS, I AND MEMBERS
                            OF COUNTRY TEAM CONTINUE TO BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT US MILITARY ADVISORY
                            MISSION TO IRAN (AARMISH/MAAG) SHOULD NOT BE REDUCED BUT IN FACT SHOULD
                            BE AUGMENTED AS HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY SHAH. WE HAVE STRESSED MANY TIMES
                            IN PAST UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT ROLE <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> PLAYS IN BOLSTERING US INTERESTS IN IRAN
                                (<gloss target="#t_REF1">REF</gloss> C AND PREVIOUS), BUT IT BEARS
                            REPEATING.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH CONSIDERS US MILITARY COOPERATION (ADVICE, TRAINING AND
                            EQUIPMENT) AS SINGLE MOST VALUABLE TANGIBLE BENEFIT IRAN GETS FROM ITS
                            SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP AND RELATIONSHIP WITH US. IT IS A PRIMARY INDUCEMENT
                            FOR IMPORTANT BENEFITS US RECEIVES IN RETURN—(A) SPECIAL AND VITAL
                            IN-COUNTRY FACILITIES AT NO COST TO <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>;
                            (B) IRREPLACABLE DIRECT OVERFLIGHT CORRIDOR FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN
                            FLIGHTS BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA USED BY THOUSANDS OF US AIRCRAFT
                            ANNUALLY (C) CONTRIBUTION TO US BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED
                            MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN MILITARY PURCHASES OF EQUIPMENT, TRAINING
                            AND SERVICES; (D) MOST IMPORTANTLY CONTINUING KINSHIP WITH US WHICH HAS
                            CONTRIBUTED TO KEEPING IRAN AS DEPENDABLE SUPPORTER OF US AND FREE-WORLD
                            POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC INTERESTS IN MIDDLE EAST (IN FULFILLMENT OF
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> DOCTRINE) DESPITE
                            IRAN'S FOREIGN POLICY OF REAL NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE.</p>
                        <p>3. EFFECTIVE ADVISORY MISSION IS ITSELF ESSENTIAL PART OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MILITARY COOPERATION ON WHICH OTHER
                            ASPECTS DEPEND. IT IS VITAL AND UNIQUE LINK IN BILATERAL COMMUNICATION
                            BETWEEN <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MILITARY SALES AND
                            TRAINING PROGRAMS WOULD BE CRIPPLed WITHOUT IT. SHAH CAN AFFORD TO BUY
                            ELSEWHERE <pb n="3" xml:id="d176-03" facs="d176-03"/>AND WOULD, WERE IT
                            NOT FOR HIS CONFIDENCE IN AND SATISFACTION WITH US EQUIPMENT AND
                            ADVISORY SUPPORT FOR TRAINING AND UIPMENT USE AND MAINTENANCE. <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss>'S ADVICE OVER WHOLE
                            RANGE OF MILITARY MATTERS IS HIGHLY REGARDED BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE IN RATIONALIZING, AND LETTING
                            IRAN'S MILITARY GROWTH AND EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION, BOTH US AND THIRD
                            COUNTRY, BENEFITS OF WHICH—E.G. RESTRAINT ON REGIONAL ARMS RACE—wOULD BE
                            LOST WITHOUT <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. MOREOVER, <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> HAS BECOME BELL WEATHER
                            FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> OF US SUPPORT FOR AND INTEREST
                            IN IRAN, AT TIME WHEN SHAH AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> VIEW
                            WITH INCREASING CONCERN SOVIET ADVANCES IN AREA AND APPARENT US
                            RETRENCHMENT. SHAH IS PREPARED ASSUME MORE RESPONSIBLE ROLE IN KEEPING
                            WITH NIXON DOCTRINE BUT CANNOT ACHIEVE CREDIBLE MILITARY DETERRENT ON
                            WHICH THIS ROLE BASED WITHOUT COOPERATION IN MILITARY FIELD FROM US.</p>
                        <p>4.FAVORABLE IMPACT AND RESPONSIBLE ROLE OF <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON ITS ADEQUATE MANNING
                            TO SERVE IRANIAN (AND US) NEEDS. BALPA AND OPRED CUTS WHICH REDUCED
                            ADVISORY PERSONNEL BY NEARLY 40 PER CENT SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED ABILITY OF
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> TO FULFILL ITS UNDERTAKINGS AT
                            TIME WHEN ACCELERATED PACE OF IRANIAN MILITARY MODERNIZATION, INCREASING
                            ACQUISITION <pb n="4" xml:id="d176-04" facs="d176-04"/>OF SOPHISTICATED
                            MODERN EQUIPMENT, AND INTRODUCTION OF MODERN PERSONNEL, MANAGEMENT,
                            LOGISTICS SYSTEMS CALLED MORE THAN EVER FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AADVISORY EXPERTISE. REQUEST BY SHAH FOR ADDITIONAL
                            ADVISORS REFLECTED HIS RECOGNITION OF THIS REAL NEED. FAILURE TO MEET
                            THIS REQUEST IN OUR VIEW—AND THIS GOES DOUBLY FOR ANY CUTS IN PRESENT
                            STAFFING—WOULD LEAVE SERIOUS GAPS IN US ADVISORY EFFORT AND CAUSE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO FALL SHORT IN SUPPORT FOR EQUIPMENT
                            SALES. INEVITABLE RESULT WILL BE THAT SHAH WILL TURN ELSEWHERE FOR
                            NECESSARY ADVISORY ASSISTANCE WE CANNOT PROVIDE AND FOR EQUIPMENT. AS
                            CONSEQUENCE WE CAN EXPECT EROSION OF US INFLUENCE AND LOSS OF FOREIGN
                            EXCHANGE FAR GREATER THAN ANY SAVING <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> REDUCTION MIGHT GENERATE TO SAY NOTHING OF SETBACKS TO

                        <p>5. WE ARE CONVINCED COMPELLING REASONS EXIST TO INCREASE <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> COMPLEMENT BY 36
                            POSITIONS AS PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED. MOREOVER UNDER <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> PROPOSAL TO REORGANIZE <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> THIS CAN BE DONE AND 15 PERCENT CUT

                                regarding a member of the Shah's entourage, Amir Hushang Davallou,
                                who had been charged in Switzerland with narcotics trafficking.
                                Invoking diplomatic immunity, DAVALLOU had departed the country on
                                the private plane of the Shah, who allegedly cut short his vacation
                                to get DAVALLOU out of the country. The scandal rekindled charges of
                                narcotics trafficking within the Shah's inner circle. (Ibid, SOC

                            END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. ACTING ON INSTRUCTION PRINCESS <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>, MEMBER OF HER STAFF (AMBASSADOR PARVIZ RADJI)
                            CALLED POLITICAL COUNSELOR TO HIS OFFICE APRIL 10 TO: (A) ADVISE THAT
                            PRINCESS IS BRINGING SUITS AGAINST SEVERAL SWISS AND FRENCH PAPERS AND
                            (B) REQUEST COOPERATION OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IN
                            CONNECTION WITH SUIT AGAINST NOUVELLE OBSERVATEUR.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d177-02" facs="d177-02"/>
                        <p>2. RADJI EXPLAINED THAT PRINCESS HAD CANCELLED PLANS TO ATTEND HUMAN
                            RIGHTS COMMISSION MEETING IN NEW YORK AND HAD REMAINED IN PARIS FOR PAST
                            MONTH (CIRCA MARCH 5 TO APRIL 4). SHE HAD DECIDED HER PRESENCE IN NEW
                            YORK AT TIME OF PRESS OUTCRY RE (A) PRINCE DAVALLOU'S ARREST IN
                            SWITZERLAND ON DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGE AND (B) ARRESTS, TRIALS AND
                            EXECUTIONS OF SUBVERSIVES IN IRAN, WOULD BE DISSERVICE TO IRAN, HIM AND
                            HERSELF.</p>
                        <p>3. WHILE IN PARIS, SHE BECAME INFURIATED BY SCURRILOUS STORIES IN SWISS
                            AND FRENCH PAPERS WHICH HAD REVIVED (IN CONNECTION WITH COVERAGE OF
                            PRINCE DAVALLOU'S ARREST) CHARGE THAT PRINCESS HERSELF HAD BEEN
                            DISCOVERED BY SWISS AUTHORITIES IN FEBRUARY 1961 (<gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> 1961) TO BE CARRYING LARGE QUANTITIES
                            OF HEROIN. SHE HAD DECIDED, THEREFORE, THAT FOR GOOD OF
                                <persName>PAHLAVI</persName> NAME AND HER OWN STANDING IN
                            INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, SHE MUST ERASE THIS CHARGE FROM PUBLIC RECORD
                            ONCE AND FOR ALL. WITH THIS IN VIEW, SHE HAS ALREADY INSTITUTED SUITS
                            AGAINST PAPERS INVOLVED, WHICH INCLUDE LE MONDE, NOUVELLE OBSERVATEUR,
                            LE JOURNAL DE GENEVE AND LA SUISSE (AND PERHAPS AT LATER DATE CANARD
                            ENCHAINE). PRINCESS DOES NOT PLAN TO PUBLICIZE HER DECISION BRING SUITS
                            OR SEEK PUBLICITY WHILE SUITS IN PROCESS, THOUGH WILL PROBABLY WANT
                            PUBLICITY ONCE DECISIONS HANDED DOWN.</p>
                        <p>4. RADJI CLAIMS THAT PRINCESS HAS NOW SECURED DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE FROM
                            FEDERAL SWISS GOVERNMENT, CANTON OF GENEVA AND GENEVA POLICE PROVING
                            IRREFUTABLY THAT ALLEGED INCIDENT IN 1961 INVOLVING HER IN TRANSPORT OF
                            HEROIN HAD SIMPLY NEVER TAKEN PLACE. HE SAID EVIDENCE WAS SUCH AS TO
                            MAKE IT 99 PERCENT SURE PRINCESS WOULD WIN HER SUITS AGAINST PAPERS
                            NOTED.</p>
                        <p>5. HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT NOUVELLE OBSERVATEUR HAD ALSO, QUOTING THE
                            NATION OF APRIL 12, 1965 (<gloss target="#t_RPT1">RPT</gloss> 1965),
                            CHARGED THAT FEDERAL NARCOTICS BUREAU HAD ONCE RECOMMENDED <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> NEVER AGAIN PERMIT <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> TO ENTER US ON GROUNDS OF HER
                            INVOLVEMENT IN HEROIN TRAFFICKING. PRINCESS IS ANXIOUS TO REFUTE THIS
                            CHARGE ALTHOUGH NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THIS IS NEEDED TO WIN HER CASE
                            (THOUGH IT WOULD BE HELPFUL) AS TO CLEAR ALL CHARGES FROM RECORD AT SAME
                            TIME, SHE HAS, THEREFORE, ASKED THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            BE REQUESTED TO PROVIDE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ON CONFIDENTIAL BASIS (FOR
                            USE IN SUIT AGAINST NOUVELLE OBSERVATEUR) TO EFFECT FEDERAL NARCOTICS
                            BUREAU HAD NEVER MADE RECOMMENDATION OF <pb n="3" xml:id="d177-03" facs="d177-03"/>NATURE CHARGED.</p>
                        <p>6. WE TOLD RADJI THIS REQUEST FROM PRINCESS WOULD BE PROMPTLY BROUGHT TO
                            WASHINGTON'S ATTENTION AND WE WERE SURE IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED
                            SYMPATHETICALLY, THOUGH WE WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> LAWS OR REGULATIONS MIGHT AFFECT THIS
                            MATTER.</p>
                        <p>7. RADJI THEN ASKED, PREFACING QUESTION WITH COMMENT "THIS NIGHTMARE" HAD
                            NOT SEEMED TO OCCUR TO ANYONE ELSE, WHETHER FEDERAL BUREAU OF NARCOTICS
                            HAD IN FACT MADE SUCH RECOMMENDATION AND, IF SO, HOW MATTER COULD THEN
                            BE HANDLED. WE REPLIED WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE ON THIS SCORE BUT NOTED ALL
                            GOVERMNENT AGENCIES (US AND IRANIAN) UNDOUBTEDLY ACT OR MAKE
                            RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME OCCASIONS ON BASIS OF UNCONFIRMED RUMORS AND
                            REPORTS. THUS, IT NOT BEYOND REALM OF POSSIBILITY REPORTS OF PRINCESS
                            INVOLVEMENT IN HEROIN INCIDENT IN 1961 HAD GAINED ENOUGH CURRENCY AT
                            TIME SO THAT SOME <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AGENT OF AGENCY
                            MIGHT HAVE ADDRESSED ITSELF TO PROBLEM.</p>
                        <p>8. RADJI SAID PRINCESS IS ANXIOUS MOVE AHEAD WITH SUITS AGAINST PAPER AT
                            EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME AND BEFORE SUMMER RECESS OF FRENCH COURTS. SHE
                            HOPES, THEREFORE, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> COOPERATION IN
                            THIS MATTER CAN RE FORTHCOMING WITHIN NEAR FUTURE.</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHETHER, IN
                            PRINCIPLE, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> PREPARED PROVIDE TYPE OF
                            DOCUMENT REQUESTED BY <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>
                            (ASSUMING FACTS SO WARRANT). IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, NEEDLESS TO SAY,
                            WE WILL WANT FULLEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF REASONS.</p>
                        <p>IT IS PERHAPS SUPERFLOUS TO POINT OUT THAT, PARTICULARLY WITH
                            PRESIDENTIAL VISIT IN OFFING, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EMBARRASSING TO BOTH
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> IF IT WERE TO BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT SHAH'S
                            SISTER HAD REQUESTED SUCH DOCUMENT, BUT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> UNABLE PROVIDE IT BECAUSE THERE HAD IN FACT BEEN
                            RECOMMENDATION BY FEDERAL NARCOTICS BUREAU OF NATURE CHARGED BY NOUVELLE
                            OBSERVATEUR AND THE NATION. FOR THIS REASON, WE TRUST INQUIRIES INTO
                            MATTER CAN BE MADE ON MOST DISCREET BASIS.</p>
                        <p>EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> ABLE PROVIDE
                            TYPE OF DOCUMENT REQUESTED, IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY NOT ENHANCE OUR RELATIONS
                            WITH COURT IF NEWS OF <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>'S
                            SUITS AGAINST EUROPEAN PRESS WERE TO LEAK FROM US SOURCES.</p>

                            STATE DEPARTMENT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY OFFICIAL RECOMMENDATION BY ANY

                        <p>2. FOREGOING NOTWITHSTANDING, WE SERIOUSLY QUESTION WHETHER SUCH A

                            APPEARS TO BE PERIPHERAL AT BEST TO HER MAIN PURPOSE. SUGGEST THEREFORE,

                            TO BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> HAD REQUESTED SUCH A DOCUMENT AND WE WERE TO

                                movement, condemning the Shah's reign. In response, on August 18,
                                1971, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                                wrote to Purcell, denouncing the character and activities of the
                                organization and its chairman, on the basis of FBI information. The
                                Department official assigned to deliver the letter to Purcell was
                                advised to “reminisce about a number of other Congressmen who had
                                taken up the anti-Shah banner in the 1960's, much to their
                                subsequent embarrassment.” On October 21, 1971, Purcell apologized
                                for his action, agreeing that “Free Iran” was unworthy of his
                                support. All of this correspondence was passed to Court Minister
                                ALAM for the Shah's perusal on November 7, 1971. (<gloss target="#t_NEAIRN1">NEA/IRN</gloss>, Office of Iran Affairs, Lot

                        <p> Nasser G. Afshar, Editor of the Iran Free Press, wrote the President on
                            April 7 criticizing him for planning to visit Iran after the trip to
                            Moscow in late May. <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>
                            strongly dislikes the Shah whose leadership, <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> claims, represents the most "corrupt and barbaric
                            rule" of this century.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>'s Iran Free Press
                            (believed by State to be his own one-man operation) is dedicated to
                            criticism of the Shah. Last year the Press made similar representations
                            against Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                            participation in the US committee honoring Iran's 2500th anniversary. We
                            — and the Shah — consider this group offensive.</p>
                        <p>Evidently, <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>'s original
                            letter was sent to State for direct reply. [State shares our view that
                            no reply — or at a minimum, simple acknowledgement — is the general
                            guidance for handling the IFP.] <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName> subsequently phoned Mr. Ziegler's office to find
                            out whether he would be getting a reply; he followed up by sending along
                            a copy of his April 7 letter under cover of a note to one of Mr.
                            Ziegler's secretaries. That exchange is attached. In a further call from

                            informed his mail was received and would be forwarded to appropriate
                            persons. We consider action on the attached, therefore, ended since we
                            do not contemplate any further reply from here.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>We take this moment to wish you great success in your forthcoming journey
                            to the Soviet Union, recognizing that, while there are many perils, the
                            chance for an enduring peace must be seized and built upon. The
                            relaxation of world tensions has clearly been the great goal of your
                            presidency, and you have done much to build towards this goal by seeking
                            an atmosphere of realism and understanding among all the world's great
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>We do not wish to dilute our strong and sincere admiration for your
                            initiative for peace. There is, however, a story related to the Russian
                            visit which profoundly disturbs us, and that is the possibility of your
                            stopping over in Iran on the return flight. In other times, we would
                            welcome such an honor. Every citizen of Iran admires and respects you as
                            the President of a great nation. We recognize beyond doubt the tribute
                            you wish in turn to pay to the Iranian people. Unfortunately, your
                            gesture, however well motivated by feelings toward the people of Iran,
                            will inevitably be seen, within. Iran and throughout the world, as one
                            of support for the most corrupt and barbaric rule of this century.</p>
                        <p>Present day Iran, for all the propaganda aimed by the Shah <persName corresp="#p_PMR1">Pahlavi</persName> at the opinion makers of the
                            world, is a police state. It recognizes not one of the most fundamental
                            of the rights of man, not freedom of speech, not freedom of assembly,
                            not the most elementary ideals of fair and public trials. What is more —
                            and this should be especially galling to you, Mr. President, who have
                            worked so hard and effectively to combat the international flow of
                            illicit drugs — the Iranian government and the royal family itself,
                            despite new and tough-looking drug laws and incredibly harsh sentences
                            handed down under them, is deeply enmeshed in the production and
                            distribution of raw opium, as well as manufacture and distribution of
                            the heroin derivative.</p>
                        <p>The instances of drug smuggling by the Shah's twin, Princess <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>, by the Shah's brother, by
                            Prince Dawallou, by member after member of the Shah's blood family and
                            political family, grow practically daily to proportions that would seem
                            slapstick comedy were the implications for the <pb n="3" xml:id="d179-03" facs="d179-03"/>youth of the world not so deadly
                            and tragic. In Paris, in Switzerland, throughout the world, the
                            attempted arrests, the attempted disclosures of this hideous network of
                            death are thwarted by the same sad phrase -diplomatic immunity. In the
                            most recent incident in this pathetic pattern, the Shah himself was
                            forced secretly to escape Switzerland, taking with him key members of
                            his staff in order to avoid disclosure of the entire network of illegal
                            traffic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, your concern for the freedom of the American people from
                            the terrible scourge of habitual drugs is honorable and commendable. You
                            have used and continue to use the power and prestige of the United
                            States and of the Presidency to control the disease of drug abuse all
                            over the world. What you have done in conjunction with the government of
                            Turkey is particularly adroit and admirable. But, we do not understand
                            how you, as the representative of the American people and of the

                            even for one day, knowing the corruption they practice daily, knowing
                            the traffic in drugs smuggled week by week under cover of diplomatic
                            immunity, knowing the American lives they jeopardize, and the lives all
                            over the world.</p>
                        <p>The people of Iran will not understand. The world will not understand
                            that a man as President of the United States, under the flag of freedom,
                            freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, and under the flag of
                            other freedoms, freedom from fear, freedom from the nightmare of
                            narcotics, can bestow by his official visit the mantle of respectability
                            upon a monarchy which is so much the opposite of your ideals. We
                            sincerely believe and hope that you will decide for the Iranian people,
                            that you will not become the official guest of the present regime.</p>

                        <p>The study of politics is the study of influence and the influential.… The
                            influential are those who get the most of what there is to get. Those
                            who get the most are the elite; the rest are mass. (Harold Lasswell)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>One of the most dramatic efforts at modernization among the less
                            developed countries is taking place in Iran. This modernization follows
                            no bloody coup or overturn of the social order, but is an attempt by a
                            long-established political and social system to adapt itself and its
                            institutions to new needs.</p>
                        <p>Power in Iran remains, as it has been, in the hands of a small segment of
                            society which enjoys the available rewards of money, status, and
                            political influence. Heading the list of the privileged few is the Shah,
                            followed by the royal family, and courtiers, followed by politicians,
                            influential businessmen, entrepreneurs, and educators. A new class of
                            professional bureaucratic intelligentsia is beginning to emerge; if this
                            group is not absorbed by the elite, it may play an increasingly
                            important independent role. In the privileged group, but playing an
                            essentially negative role at present, are those members of the educated
                            professional class-some even from establishment families-who refuse to
                            cooperate with the ruling elite, and the clergy, whose strength lies in
                            the emotions of the Iranian masses and whose opposition to the Shah's
                            government is nearly total.</p>

                        <p>The Iranian social-political structure under the
                                <persName>Pahlavi</persName> dynasty today is in broad outline much
                            as it developed during the Qajar dynasty (1792-1925) that preceded it.
                            In the 50 years of the Pahlavis, secularization of government and
                            massive Western influence have modified, but not yet transformed,
                            Iranian society. Current trends, however, suggest that the pace of
                            change may speed up sharply.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Traditional Iranian System</p>
                        <p>We have decided that a National Consultative Assembly shall be formed and
                            constituted in Tehran with deputies to be elected by the following
                            classes of people: The Princes, the clergy, the Qajar family, nobles and
                            notables, landowners, merchants and tradesmen (Proclamation of Mozaffar
                            ed-Din Shah establishing the first national assembly, 5 August 1906)</p>
                        <p>Iran has had from the earliest times a clearly defined class structure,
                            explicitly recognized by all participants. The major class categories
                            have occupied almost the same relative positions through the centuries;
                            first, the ruling family; then tribal leaders and warriors, bureaucrats,
                            religious leaders, businessmen; and finally the peasants and laborers.
                            Even major historical events have had little effect on this structure.
                            Thus, when the Arabs conquered Iran in the 6th century AD and imposed
                            Islam, the Persian ruling class quickly went over to the Arabs,
                            converted to Islam, and preserved their own position and social
                            structure. In the process, however, they put a unique Persian stamp on
                            the governmental institutions that evolved from the Arab conquest. New
                            Moslem religious leaders, for example, fitted neatly into the slots
                            vacated by the Zoroastrian priestly class, and the masses became
                            Islamized without serious resistance. Again, when the Qajar dynasty was
                            dethroned by <persName>Reza</persName> Shah in 1925, most of the nobles
                            and notables went over to the <persName>Pahlavi</persName> dynasty, thus
                            preserving their wealth and status, although in this case sharing power
                            with new faces brought in by <persName>Reza</persName> Shah.</p>
                        <p>This adaptability of the elite has helped today's Shah in his efforts to
                            reshape and modernize Iran, but ensuing changes have fostered a new
                            class of professional bureaucratic intelligentsia that the traditional
                            system may not be able to absorb. Moreover, the Shah's unprecedented
                            attention to the lowest classes, if it results in giving them real
                            political power, would over a longer term drastically alter a stable,
                            centuries-old system.</p>
                        <p>In point of fact, however, and despite the apparent permanence of the
                            classes, upward social mobility has always been possible in Iran and is
                            becoming increasingly so. Each class possesses to some extent a checking
                            influence that can be brought to bear upon other groups and classes.
                            Lower and lower-middle class individuals have occasionally been able to
                            move into the political elite to become prime ministers, even shahs, as
                            typified by <persName>Reza</persName> Shah who came from a peasant
                            family. Gardeners, water carriers, stable boys, and cobblers have
                            sometimes climbed to positions of power. Channels for this upward
                            mobility have been few and scattered, but there are enough examples to
                            provide credibility.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d180-06" facs="d180-06"/>
                        <p>Normally, entry into the ruling class has been controlled by the
                            political elite themselves through sponsorship of selected individuals.
                            Wealth, at least until recently, has usually been a necessity, and land
                            ownership has in the past been the major source of wealth. Nonetheless,
                            the ever-present possibility of advancement has served to deflect
                            demands for structural changes and has helped maintain the system by
                            allowing an occasional success story. By this means, the Shah today
                            obtains the technical skills and modern expertise he needs to carry on
                            his reform program. Whether the new arrivals in the elite will become
                            part of the traditional establishment or become the nucleus of reformers
                            capable of altering the status quo remains an open question.</p>
                        <p>Two key elements in the functioning of the Iranian political system are
                            the dowreh, or circle of associates, and family connections. Informal
                            contacts thus provide the real motion in Iranian political life. These
                            contacts and connections often are made by virtue of membership in one
                            or more dowrehs. These meet periodically to promote mutual interests,
                            and while the basic reason for the formation of a dowreh may be
                            professional, family, religious, or intellectual, the circle's most
                            important function is the building of a network of personal ties to
                            assist the members in their political and economic endeavors. If, for
                            example, one member is appointed to a ministerial position, other
                            members of the dowreh can expect to move forward politically. Most
                            active politicians belong to several dowrehs. Moreover, the dowrehs
                            frequently cut across class lines, thus serving to relieve inter-class
                            pressures and animosities. In this function, the dowreh also serves as a
                            mechanism for the non-elite to move into the elite status.</p>
                        <p>One of the oldest dowrehs, the "French-doctorate group,” met weekly for
                            25 years. In one three-year period its 11 members included a prime
                            minister, three cabinet ministers, two senators, three ambassadors, the
                            director of the National Oil Company, and the president of the Tehran
                            Chamber of Commerce. Another prominent dowreh, in this case a poker
                            club, includes General Fardust, deputy chief of <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>; General <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName>, chief of the air force, and
                            Taqi Alavi-Kia, brother of a retired <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> general, who is a builder with lucrative contracts
                            for air force housing. This dowreh has direct contact with the Shah
                            through Fardust and <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName>, and
                            with Princess <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>-the Shah's
                            twin sister-through Fardust. Alavi-Kia provides a channel to the
                            business and commercial worlds through his own contacts and those of his
                            brother, who is engaged in the agro-business industry.</p>
                        <p>Along with the dowrehs, family relationships retain major importance.
                            Below the monarchy, Iranian society is dominated by a relatively small
                                <pb n="7" xml:id="d180-07" facs="d180-07"/>group of elite families,
                            which wield power and influence not only in politics but also in
                            business, commerce, and the professions. Members of these families move
                            from government to political jobs to private pursuits and back again
                            with facility, and indeed their political influence may be nearly as
                            great when they are in private life as in public office.</p>
                        <p>The principal criterion for membership in the elite in Qajar times was
                            wealth to buy land, office, and political power. At the end of the 19th
                            century the principal offices, whether for local tax collector or
                            cabinet minister were, in effect, auctioned off at the annual New Year's
                            ceremony. Low birth or social status was no obstacle to high position.
                            In actual practice, most of the peasant population was cut off from the
                            means of attaining wealth and hence political power. Once obtained,
                            however, either by personal ability or, more likely, by sponsorship of
                            an already influential person, social acceptance and political power
                            followed almost automatically.</p>
                        <p>Although new faces often did enter the elite, as time passed much of the
                            political power tended to be passed around within the same group of
                            families. The change of dynasty in 1925 produced a new crop of elite
                            personalities, but these quickly became indistinguishable from the bulk
                            of the influentials who easily transferred their allegiance from the
                            Qajars to the Pahlavis.</p>
                        <p>The core of the elite establishment is perhaps 12 families. An additional
                            30 families cluster around the core and some 150 more are influential.
                            Perhaps 20 percent of the families, including most of the top 40, were
                            prominent under the Qajars. The immediate family of the Qajars lived in
                            political obscurity under <persName>Reza</persName> Shah, although
                            maintaining a sort of shadow court among themselves, and a few served
                            the Pahlavis in minor capacities.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Monarchy</p>
                        <p>“The Shah is confused, frustrated, suspicious, proud, and stubborn, a
                            young man who lives in the shadow of his father. His fears,
                            questionings, and indecisiveness are permanent instabilities of
                            character. Yet, he has great personal courage, many Western ideals, and
                            a sincere, though often wavering, desire to raise and preserve his
                            country.”</p>

                        <p>“He (the Shah) is completely self-assured and is confident that he is
                            leading the country in the right direction. He is also well-informed,
                            and his ability to keep abreast of developments around the world is
                            remarkable. He has an agile mind, sees the point quickly, and gets right

                        <p>The monarchy, as the apex of the social-political pyramid, has been a
                            constant feature of Iranian life and has been a major factor in
                            maintaining a national identity. Individual monarchs, however, have been
                            treated with less respect than the institution. From 1795, when the
                            first of the Qajar Shahs took power, to the present time, only two out
                            of nine shahs died in office of natural causes. Four were deposed, two
                            assassinated, and there was one complete change of dynasty. Two attempts
                            have been made to assassinate the present Shah.</p>
                        <p>This great potential power of the shah's office has frequently been
                            watered down by personal weaknesses that left real authority to
                            courtiers, by poor communication and the long distances between the
                            capital and the provinces that have allowed provincial governors virtual
                            autonomy and, until recently, by lack of regular military forces under
                            the control of the central government. Between 1921 and 1941,
                                <persName>Reza</persName> Shah began to bring provincial
                            administration under central control. The present Shah has continued
                            this process; today he is the major locus of power in Iran and probably
                            possesses more effective power over more of the country than any ruler
                            has for a millennium.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's father, General Reza Khan, was proclaimed Shah by parliament
                            in 1925. He gained the throne at a time of national confusion and on the
                            strength of his military exploits. Although barely literate, his
                            forceful character and ruthless drive made him feared by all, hated by
                            some, and loved by few.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PMR1">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</persName> assumed the
                            throne in 1941-at the age of 22-when his father was forced to abdicate
                            after the Russian-British invasion of Iran. He immediately faced
                            problems that would have taxed even a more experienced leader-foreign
                            occupation, with the Russians apparently determined to annex permanently
                            most of northern Iran, a depressed economy, and runaway inflation.
                            Politicians, released after 20 years from Reza Shah's iron control,
                            again began maneuvering for personal advantage and position. The
                            qualities that had made Reza Shah great were not all transmitted to his
                            son. One observer remarked that Mohammad Reza's eldest sister, Shams,
                            inherited Reza Shah's common sense; Ali, the younger brother, now dead,
                            his brute physical strength; amd <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>, Mohammad Reza's twin sister, his merciless
                            determination; while Mohammad Reza inherited his father's dream of
                            national progress. In his early days as Shah, Mohammad Reza was not
                            esteemed by his own family. The Queen Mother appeared to hold her eldest
                            son in contempt. She was frequently reported to be intriguing against
                            him and promoting Ali as a more worthy successor, and on one occasion
                            she remarked that it was a pity <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> was not the Shah.</p>

                        <p>The present Shah grew up in isolation from the Iranian political scene.
                            Reza Shah's autocratic style gave his Crown Prince little chance to
                            develop any independent following, and he had virtually no direct
                            contact with government operations. In addition, Mohammad Reza's four
                            years of schooling in Switzerland provided an exposure to Western
                            concepts of democracy quite alien to his father's methods. The Shah also
                            saw that his father, with all his power, could be overthrown with hardly
                            a hand raised in his behalf. Even the army on which Reza Shah had built
                            his reputation failed to make more than a token resistance. Finally, the
                            Shah was sensitive to the corruption that had overtaken
                                <persName>Reza</persName> Shah in the latter years of his rule.</p>
                        <p>Another factor probably played a role in Mohammed Reza's personal and
                            political development- circumstances of the birth of his heir. First
                            married in 1939, it was 21 years and two marriages later before a Crown
                            Prince, another <persName>Reza</persName>, was born. A first marriage to
                            Fawzieh, King Farouk's sister, was primarily a political move. The only
                            issue of this marriage, which ended in divorce after 11 years, was a
                            daughter. In 1950 the Shah married Soraya Esfandiari, who produced no
                            children and was divorced in 1959. His marriage in 1959 to Farah Diba, a
                            Parisian-educated member of an old but somewhat impecunious family, was
                            followed at last by the birth of two sons as well as two daughters. The
                            rapidity with which the Shah pushed his reform program after 1960
                            probably had some relationship to the fact that he felt he had assured
                            the continuation of the <persName>Pahlavi</persName> dynasty.</p>
                        <p>In the first decade of his rule, the Shah's influence was basically
                            negative. He could veto an action or policy of his government, but his
                            ability to initiate policies was limited by political opposition and
                            bureaucratic lethargy. In addition, in this period the Shah remained
                            isolated from real politics, surrounded by a coterie of often venal
                            court sycophants and generally diverted by fun and games. In private
                            conversations with foreign representatives, however, the Shah frequently
                            appeared to be trying to define his role. When in the course of a
                            conversation with the US ambassador, the latter expressed the opinion
                            that the Shah should remain aloof from politics and become a symbol of
                            unity, the Shah commented wryly, "My sister <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> asked me yesterday whether I was a man or a
                            mouse,” and then added seriously "Do you mean that I should stay in my
                            palace at Saadabad, selfishly enjoy my pleasant gardens, dogs, and
                            horses, and do nothing about the tragic situation of my country?”</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d180-12" facs="d180-12"/>
                        <p>There is some indication that on occasion the Shah at least condoned
                            forceful action. In 1956, the then minister of court in a conversation
                            with a US Embassy officer "clearly implied" that former prime minister
                            Razmara had been murdered "with the full knowledge of the Shah, if not
                            on his direct Order.” The minister of court also stated that he had
                            acted as intermediary between "the court" and the murderers of
                            Mossadeq's police chief, General Afshartus. In general, however, the
                            Shah continued in a passive position, apparently attempting the role of
                            a constitutional monarch, reigning but not ruling.</p>
                        <p>The watershed in the Shah's development toward his present style of rule
                            was the premiership of Mohammad Mossadeq 1951 to 1953. Mossadeq, an aged
                            and inveterate oppositionist, had retired from politics in the late
                            1920s but returned to political life after the abdication of Reza Shah.
                            Resuming a long-standing feud with the Pahlavis-both Mossadeq and his
                            wife had close family connections with the deposed Qajar
                            dynasty-Mossadeq soon found a popular issue in his opposition to British
                            control of the Iranian oil industry and was able to win the support of
                            nationalists, Communists, intelligentsia, and religious leaders. When it
                            became apparent that Mossadeq, using the oil issue, was determined to
                            reduce the monarchy to a figurehead, the Shah finally took a stand. Even
                            so, he was certainly pushed by other members of the royal family and the
                            court- notably his sister <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>
                            and his mother-who feared loss of their own positions and power.</p>
                        <p>The ensuing confrontation, with important army elements supporting the
                            monarch, resulted in a clear-cut victory for the Shah. From this point
                            on, he became increasingly assertive, and in the last decade he has
                            become the final authority in determining both domestic and foreign
                            policy, in initiating programs, and in making key appointments. His
                            domestic opposition has been silenced, by imprisoning or neutralizing
                            some and coopting others. Today, the government of Iran is the Shah.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <persName>Pahlavi</persName> Ideology</p>
                        <p>“The Monarchy ensures the stability of the country. None of the Parties
                            can head the country toward destruction because their activities take
                            place within the monarchy. By uttering the magic word 'Shah' everything
                            can be brought under control.” (Comment by the Shah in an interview for
                            Jeune Afrique 7 July 1971)</p>
                        <p>The Shah sees himself in the role of a latter-day Cyrus the Great who
                            will restore to Iran at least a portion of its old glory as a power to
                            be <pb n="13" xml:id="d180-13" facs="d180-13"/>reckoned with in its own
                            part of the world. His coronation in 1966, 25 years after he assumed the
                            throne, and the grandiose celebration of the 2,500th anniversary of the
                            founding of the Monarchy were the Shah's way of publicly affirming his
                            belief in the validity of royal rule. Although he frequently insists on
                            the possibility of a true constitutional monarchy in Iran, his actions
                            suggest that he does not foresee it in his time. A non-charismatic
                            leader, he has taken on many of the trappings of totalitarianism;
                            scarcely a town of any size does not have its Avenue
                                <persName>Pahlavi</persName> and it is a mean city, indeed, that
                            does not have a traffic circle dominated by a statue of the Shah or his
                            father. Massive rallies are held, complete with giant portraits of the
                            Shah and banners bearing quotations by him, and no politician ventures a
                            suggestion without carefully pointing out that it fits within the
                            framework approved by the Shah. In fairness, it is to be noted that
                            Iranian monarchs have always surrounded themselves with symbols of their
                            power and the bulk of the population expects them to.</p>
                        <p>The Shah is the master of what has been called the "Pahlavism”:</p>
                        <p>“I consider it vitally important for citizens of this or any other
                            country to enjoy every sort of constitutional liberty except one-the
                            liberty to betray the country.”</p>
                        <p>“It is now the duty…of all men and women…with equal rights and in
                            complete freedom, to exercise their legal and national rights…and to
                            send to the houses of parliament their true representatives.…”</p>
                        <p>“The guiding philosophy behind our revolution is the principle of
                            individual and social freedom as well as the freedom and independence of
                            Iran.” While the more sophisticated foreign or local observer may scoff,
                            on the whole such declarations are accepted in Iran as meaningful
                            statements of intent.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's major preoccupations are Iran's military position in the area,
                            social reform to provide his country with a trained and loyal citizenry,
                            and economic development to support both programs. Although in theory he
                            favors responsible political activity, he has made it clear on more than
                            one occasion that this has a low priority.</p>
                        <p>The Shah's views on opposition were stated succinctly in an interview he
                            gave last August: "We like opposition. We want opposition. We are
                            encouraging opposition. We have parties like the Mardon…in the
                            opposition, but their difficulty is that there is nothing much for them
                            to oppose. …the <pb n="14" xml:id="d180-14" facs="d180-14"/>plain fact
                            is that all that our people…had been clamoring for through the ages has
                            been granted them under the 12-point Program of the Revolution.”</p>
                        <p>The Shah approves party candidates for parliament before they are
                            permitted to stand for election. In some cases he may specify who will
                            win. By this means he is not only assured of a parliament that will be
                            responsive to his programs, but he can provide wider participation of
                            some groups, e.g., women who would otherwise not be elected.</p>
                        <p>The Shah takes a hard line in negotiations with outsiders, although he is
                            amenable to compromise to reach an agreement that favors Iran. The
                            periodic negotiations with the oil consortium are the best examples of
                            this. Starting with extreme demands, coupled with hints of what could
                            happen to consortium interests, a firm position is held until the last
                            minute possible when a quick Iranian concession leads to a settlement.
                            Iran ends up with a healthy increase in oil revenues and the oil
                            companies are usually relieved to have gotten off with less than Iran's
                            maximum demands.</p>
                        <p>Short of assassination or a sudden illness, the Shah will probably
                            continue his present style of ruling for perhaps as much as two decades.
                            The Crown Prince will not reach his majority for another ten years, and
                            while some responsibilities may be delegated to him as he grows older,
                            the Shah will remain the overshadowing personality as was his own
                            father.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Court</p>
                        <p>The court was considered at one time to be the center of licentiousness
                            and depravity, of corruption and influence peddling, but the Shah has in
                            recent years tightened his control, and the court's role has diminished.
                            For example, the Queen Mother-once an inveterate intriguer-is seldom
                            heard from, and the Shah's half-brothers, reported in the past to be
                            potential contenders for the throne, now appear in public only to open
                            sports events, present trophies, or officiate at ceremonies too
                            inconsequential for the Shah's personal attention.</p>
                        <p>Access to court personalities is still considered important, however, to
                            ensure success in business and political activities. The Shah, on his
                            side, relies on some ten people to provide him direct access to major
                            interest groups. These advisers include Queen <persName corresp="#p_PFD1">Farah</persName>; Princess <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_EM3">Manuchehr Eqbal</persName>, chairman of the National Iranian Oil
                            Company; General Ayadi, the Shah's personal physician; Sharif-Emami, a
                            senator and old-time politician; Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>; Ardeshir Zahedi, former
                            foreign minister; Generals Fardust and Yazdanpanah; and Minister of
                            Court ALAM. They do not work as a team; several, in fact, are rivals, a
                            situation that the Shah probably encourages.</p>

                        <p>Queen <persName corresp="#p_PFD1">Farah</persName> has been by all
                            accounts an influence for good, and, of all the court personalities, she
                            probably has the most influence on the Shah. She is intelligent and
                            cosmopolitan in outlook and appears to take her position seriously. She
                            has been active and effective in promoting social issues and, unlike
                            many others connected with the court, she has never been touched by
                            scandal.</p>
                        <p>Princess <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>, the Shah's twin
                            sister, was for years the central figure in nearly all the scandal
                            connected with the court. Her intervention on behalf of her paramours
                            was notorious, and it was widely rumored that she herself was involved
                            in drug-smuggling. She has become more discreet, however, and is even
                            undertaking semi-diplomatic missions for her brother. Ashraf has also
                            energetically promoted women's rights, both in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and at home, and has participated in
                            other social causes. Despite her improving image, however, she retains
                            many of her old characteristics. <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>'s representations on behalf of contractors or
                            consultants are still decisive in the award of government contracts,
                            although she apparently no longer gets a kickback for this service.</p>
                        <p>Over the years <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> has helped
                            several men up the bureaucratic ladder. The current favorite of the
                            52-year-old Princess appears to be 36-year-old Parviz Raji, assistant to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>. Raji, who
                            has family connections with two of the core families, is rated as one of
                            the more promising young men in the government. Educated at Oxford and
                            with considerable experience in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he has
                            been given the personal rank of ambassador. This kind of relationship
                            probably has mutual advantages, aside from the purely personal. It gives
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName> a valuable pipeline
                            into the Prime Minister's office, while Raji is assured of a powerful
                            influence in his subsequent career, providing they part amicably.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>'s enmity can also be
                            powerful. A feud between <persName corresp="#p_PPA1">ASHRAF</persName>
                            and former foreign minister Ardeshir Zahedi was at least partly
                            responsible for Zahedi's removal from office in 1971.</p>
                        <p>Generals Morteza Yazdanpanah and Hossein Fardust owe their positions to
                            long-standing friendship with the Shah. General Yazdanpanah was a friend
                            of <persName>Reza</persName> Shah before the latter took the throne in
                            1925, serving him faithfully in a variety of military and cabinet posts,
                            although he later fell from favor. He was the present Shah's military
                            tutor and has maintained a close relationship for 40 years.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="d180-17" facs="d180-17"/>
                        <p>Major General Hossein Fardust is a contemporary and was a childhood
                            friend of the Shah. He first met the Crown Prince in elementary school
                            and accompanied him to school in Switzerland and military college in
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>[Photo: The shah (foreground) and Major General Hossein Fardust (r):
                            Childhood Friends]</p>
                        <p>Except for a brief period, Fardust has always held important positions
                            and had great authority even though his military promotions have been at
                            a near normal rate. Fardust has been chief of the Shah's Special
                            Intelligence Group and deputy chief of the National Intelligence and
                            Security Organization. He is quiet, unassuming, and meticulous in
                            carrying out his duties. Fardust is well off financially but is
                            considered personally honest. In his own words, "whatever I have, I have
                            through the grace of the Palace.”</p>
                        <p> Jaafar Sharif-Emami, 62-year-old president of the Senate, is another
                            veteran government official and politician, with some reputation for
                            venality. He was a long-time civil servant in the railway
                            administration, at one time a key element in Reza Shah's modernization,
                            and has held a variety of subcabinet and cabinet-level jobs.
                            Sharif-Emami is generally considered <pb n="18" xml:id="d180-18" facs="d180-18"/>responsible for leading the Soviets in 1958 to
                            believe that Iran would be receptive to a non-aggression pact. It is
                            possible that he was acting at the Shah's behest in an effort to
                            persuade the US to increase economic and military aid. At any rate,
                            although the Shah was said to have been embarrassed by the unexpected
                            arrival of a high-level Soviet delegation prepared to negotiate a pact,
                            the incident did not hurt Sharif-Emami's career; he was subsequently
                            chosen by the Shah to be prime minister.</p>
                        <p> Ardeshir Zahedi, a former foreign minister, owes his present influence
                            to his personal devotion to the Shah, although he comes from an old
                            provincial land-holding family. He is the son of an army general, who
                            helped the Shah oust Mossadeq in 1953, and was married for several years
                            to the Shah's oldest daughter Shahnez; he held no responsible government
                            posts until his marriage. He showed no outstanding ability in any post
                            but apparently responded well to the Shah's directions. ZAHEDI was
                            probably removed as foreign minister for several reasons-one of them,
                            allegedly, his failure to turn out more heads of state for the 2,500
                            anniversary celebration at Persepolis. He still appears to enjoy the
                            personal confidence of the Shah, however, and will probably retain his
                            position close to the Monarch. Eventually, he likely will be appointed
                            again to some official position, perhaps to the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Amir Abbas Hoveyda</persName>
                            earns his role as a close adviser to the Shah by virtue of his office.
                            However, not all prime ministers have had the confidence of the Shah,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> has successfully
                            transformed his official position into one of influence. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>, nonetheless, has made it clear
                            that he acts only by the authority of and under the direction of the
                            Shah.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Abdol Karim Ayadi, the Shah's personal physician; appears to be the
                            major channel through which the Shah dabbles in commercial business. His
                            close association with the Shah seems to date from a term as chief
                            medical officer of the Imperial Guard Division; he does not come from an
                            elite family. Described as a "financial wizard,” Ayadi has been reported
                            as fronting for the Shah in the Southern Iran Fishing Company, an
                            enterprise described by knowledgeable observers as a mass of
                            inefficiency and corruption whose board of directors is filled with
                            retired generals.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EM3">Manuchehr Eqbal</persName>, a physician,
                            is from one of the top 40 families that traditionally has been powerful
                            in the province of Khorassan. He was a protege of Ahmad Qavam, the most
                            powerful politician of the late 1940s, who apparently became acquainted
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_EM3">Eqbal</persName> family in the early
                            1920s <pb n="19" xml:id="d180-19" facs="d180-19"/>when Qavam was
                            governor-general of Khorassan. <persName corresp="#p_EM3">Eqbal</persName> has been prime minister, minister of court, and
                            has held at least six different cabinet posts. He has been a
                            parliamentary deputy, a senator, an ambassador, a civil adjutant to the
                            Shah, and chancellor of the University of Tehran. He is at present
                            chairman of the board of the National Iranian Oil Company. <persName corresp="#p_EM3">Eqbal</persName> is a competent administrator but
                            has been described as a "consummate demagogue.” When he became prime
                            minister in 1957, he disappointed many of his supporters by being a
                            complete yes-man for the Shah. From a personal point of view, however,
                            this was a wise decision; his subsequent career has been notably
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>The most prestigious post in this charmed circle is that of minister of
                            court, who serves as director of the Shah's executive office. Typically,
                            he is an "elder statesman" type, from an established family, and with
                            long experience in government. More important, he must have the complete
                            confidence of the Shah, who may use him for unofficial or unattributable
                            activities. The incumbent, Amir Assadollah Alam, at 53 is one of the
                            youngest to have served in this post. The ALAM family was once the
                            biggest landlord in the country and is one of the dozen most important
                            families. ALAM's father and <persName>Reza</persName> Shah were friends,
                            and Assadollah and the Shah have been close since boyhood. ALAM has
                            served the Shah effectively in a wide variety of important posts and
                            once was prime minister.</p>

                        <p>“I consider the Shah more wise and more discerning and more knowledgeable

                        <p>In Iran, about 300 persons hold or have held in the immediate past
                            significant political power; most of these come from the top families or
                            have close connections with them. The extent to which political power
                            has become concentrated in a few hands is illustrated by the fact that
                            from the Constitutional Revolution in 1906 to the present, there have
                            been 120 different cabinets but only 39 prime ministers. Two men each
                            were appointed prime minister 11 different times. Cabinet posts were
                            similarly concentrated. In one decade, some 400 cabinet posts were
                            filled by only 144 <pb n="20" xml:id="d180-20" facs="d180-20"/>persons.
                            In the last 20 years, nine men have served as prime minister, all these
                            born or married into one of the top 40 families.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> is a good
                            example of a politician whose family per se did not entitle him to
                            high-level office but whose contacts enabled him to go to the top of the
                            executive ladder. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>, born
                            in 1919, is the son of a former ambassador. He was educated in Damascus
                            and Beirut, where his father was posted, and later at the London School
                            of Economics and the University of Brussels. He entered the diplomatic
                            service in 1944 and was stationed in Germany. There he served with
                            Hassan Ali Mansur, a member of one of the top 40 families, and with
                            Abdollah Entezam, a member of a prominent Qajar family who later became
                            an influential politician.</p>
                        <p>Throughout his subsequent career, <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> maintained close relations with both men. In
                            1958 he became special assistant to Entezam, at that time chairman of
                            the National Iranian Oil Company. Two years later <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> was appointed to the Board of
                            Directors. When his old friend Hassan Ali Mansur formed a political
                            party at the Shah's behest, <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> joined the party, and when Mansur became prime
                            minister in 1964 he personally picked <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> as minister of finance. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> and Mansur married sisters,
                            daughters of a prominent Tehran financier from a traditionally important
                            family in Azerbaijan. The net of family influence thus spread: the
                            sisters are also related to a former Qajar prime minister, and through
                            him to the Qavam family, of which Ahmad Qavam, 11 times prime minister,
                            was the most prominent. After Mansur's assassination in 1965, the Shah
                            chose <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> as his
                            successor.</p>
                        <p>Cabinet members belong to the political elite by definition. However, the
                            make-up of the cabinet has changed markedly in recent years. The
                            traditional cabinet represented a balance of political forces as well as
                            judicious juggling of the limited number of qualified people available;
                            a cabinet therefore might contain two or three men who had already
                            served as prime minister and many who had been in other cabinet posts or
                            important government jobs. When the Shah assumed undisputed control of
                            the cabinet, he favored a "technocrat" type of cabinet minister-a person
                            with specialized experience, education, and ability and, more
                            importantly, with no independent political ambitions.</p>
                        <p>The present cabinet reflects this shift. The average age is 48, the
                            youngest being 41 and the oldest 58. Nineteen of the 23 ministers were
                            educated abroad, nine in the US, six in France, two each in Belgium and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and one in Pakistan. Only four
                            were educated exclusively in Iran. Eight <pb n="21" xml:id="d180-21" facs="d180-21"/>ministers were trained as engineers and four in law.
                            The cabinet has three representatives of establishment families: Abbas
                            Ali Khalatbari, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Minister of State Hadi
                            Hedayati; and Manuchehr Kalali, also minister of state. In contrast, the
                            20-man cabinet of mid-1964 had nine members of establishment
                            families.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Parliament</p>
                        <p>Since its first meeting in 1906, parliament has been an arena for the
                            exercise of influence that often has opposed the monarchy. From the
                            outset, the members drew together to protect their own positions,
                            initially against the excesses of a reactionary and corrupt court and in
                            later years by alternately offering their services to the Shah or
                            obstructing his programs. The present Shah as well as his father found
                            it necessary to bring parliament under tight control when the members
                            wished to force through their own measures.</p>
                        <p>The 40 major families have always been represented in parliament. From
                            1906 to 1967, 400 out of some 3,000 seats in the Majlis (lower house)
                            were held by members of these families. Many of the other seats were
                            held by other members of elite families, mostly provincially based, or
                            by their hangers-on. In the Senate, the nationally prominent families
                            were even more heavily represented.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Parliament was landlord-dominated from the beginning. In the
                            first 20 sessions (1906-63), 52 percent of the deputies were landlords.
                            Even in the 21st session (1963-67)-after major reforms-35 percent were
                            landlords. This situation made it impossible to get any effective land
                            reform legislation passed until the oppositionist spirit of parliament
                            had been drastically curbed.</p>
                        <p>The Shah took advantage of widespread charges of rigging in the 1961
                            elections to dissolve the senate and the house. Although the
                            constitution required that new elections be held within a month, it was
                            more than two years before they were actually held. In the interim the
                            Shah, by royal decree, had put in effect his own land reform program and
                            had begun actual distribution of land. He had also managed a popular
                            referendum on his reform program.</p>
                        <p>After land reform was enforced, parliaments have had a different look,
                            and the Shah, through his political parties, has carefully chosen the
                            deputies to be elected, and no deputy is now identified as a landlord or
                            a representative of landlord interests, although a large number of
                            provincial <pb n="22" xml:id="d180-22" facs="d180-22"/>constituencies
                            are represented by the same people as pre-reform parliaments. It appears
                            that the Shah's major criterion for his deputies is that they not
                            overtly oppose his reform program. That they personally belong to the
                            traditional power structure is irrelevant.</p>
                        <p>As an example, in eastern Iran, an area as large as Austria, the family
                            of Court Minister Assadollah Alam has been dominant for nearly two
                            centuries, and the same four constituencies have always been controlled
                            by the family. One has been represented since 1957 by a cousin and
                            brother-in-law of Assadollah; before then another cousin of Assadollah
                            held the seat. A second has been represented by an ALAM protege for at
                            least 12 years, while the third seat is held by a long-time protege, a
                            Baluchi tribal chief; and the fourth is held by another cousin of
                            Assadollah. Still another constituency in the area is represented by a
                            member of a prominent family who is a cousin of Assadollah and a
                            brother-in-law of a present deputy from the area.</p>
                        <p>One innovation of the Shah's has been to see to it that women are elected
                            to the Majlis. However, in view of the fact that female higher education
                            has, until recent years, been confined to the wealthier families, it is
                            not surprising that the women deputies come from this class. One of
                            them, Mehrangiz Dowlatshahi, from Kermanshah in western Iran, descends
                            from the Qajars and belongs to a major landowning family. Since at least
                            1947, the Dowlatshahis-male and female-have been the Shah's choice for
                            one of the seats from Kermanshah.</p>
                        <p>Despite the persistence of family influence, the base for political power
                            is changing in parliament and the influential deputies clearly intend to
                            make the most of the change. Some of the new faces who are not well
                            connected may be in the process of building their personal power, a
                            prerequisite for eventual elite status. A considerable number have
                            served two or three terms in the post-reform parliament. If they use
                            their position to improve their finances and do favors for the right
                            people, they may well be on their way up. In addition, some may be able
                            to build a reputation in their home constituencies and thus improve
                            their chances of being chosen for election in the future. Another change
                            is the increase in the well-educated group. In the 1906 parliament, 54
                            percent of the deputies had a traditional religious-based education. The
                            remainder had a secular education: 23 percent had gone through grammar
                            school, four percent held doctorates, and 19 percent had varying degrees
                            of secondary education. In the 20th Majlis (1963-67), the last period
                            for which such information is available, 89 percent of the deputies were
                            educated in the secular system; 28 percent of these held doctorates.
                            With the Shah's emphasis on younger, better-trained deputies, this
                            proportion has probably since increased.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Military</p>
                        <p>The highest-ranking military officers show many of the hallmarks of the
                            elite. In a sample of 37 general officers, more than 60 percent were
                            born in Tehran, i.e., close to the court, and 30 percent bear elite
                            names; others are found to have married into elite families. Most
                            generals speak both French and English and have had military training in
                            the US, France, or the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. There appears
                            to be less tendency now for sons to follow their fathers into the
                            military service, probably because non-military careers are now more
                            easily available and are alternate routes to influence.</p>
                        <p>[Photo: "The Shah Reviews his Officers"]</p>
                        <p>A military career is, however, an opportunity for a lower- or
                            middle-class man to raise his status. Attendance at a free military high
                            school and the military academy is one channel. A number of general
                            officers have followed this route, although at the time today's generals
                            were in secondary school-the early and middle 1930s-the military high
                            school was a typical choice for members of the elite as well as for
                            lower-level individuals considering a military career. In the future,
                            officers coming up through the military high school are more likely to
                            be from the middle and lower classes. A civilian high school graduate
                            can be admitted directly to the military <pb n="24" xml:id="d180-24" facs="d180-24"/>academy, but the expenses of a civilian high school
                            education suggest that the free military high school may be increasingly
                            attractive to the low income groups. Whether many of these will attain
                            high rank without other requirements of the traditional elite-patronage,
                            wealth, and proper marriage-is still a question.</p>
                        <p>An outstanding example of a traditional military family is the
                            Jahanbanis. General Amanollah Jahanbani, now retired, was born about
                            1890. He is the great grandson of Fath Ali Shah, who died in 1834. The
                            Jahanbanis are thus related to the Farmanfarmayan-one of the very top
                            families, which also derives from Fath Ali Shah. Amanollah's father was
                            a governor-general of Azerbaijan and was killed by Russian occupation
                            troops there in the early 1900s. Apparently as compensation, Amanollah
                            was appointed to the Nicolayevski Cadet Corps at St. Petersburg in 1907.
                            After graduation, he attended a Russian artillery school and the War
                            Academy. He returned to Iran imbued with Russian ideas, remained close
                            to the Russians even after the Bolshevik revolution, and has been a
                            prominent member of the Iran-Soviet cultural society. Although he was
                            aide-de-camp to <persName>Ahmad</persName> Shah, Jahanbani supported
                                <persName>Reza</persName> Shah's coup against his Qajar cousin in
                            1921 and rose rapidly in the military hierarchy. One of Jahanbani's
                            marriages-to a daughter of Mozaffar ed-Din Shah (1853-1907) also linked
                            him with the fabulous Farmanfarmayans. (He also has two other wives, one
                            of whom is a Russian; in 1947 she was reported as a channel used to pay
                            Soviet agents.)</p>
                        <p>Of Amanollah's 11 or so children, three sons are generals. One is deputy
                            commander of the Air Training Center, another is commander of the
                            Armored Center, and the third is commander of an armored brigade. A
                            fourth son is a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs, while one of his nieces has married a half-brother of the Shah.
                            And so the influential network is elaborated in another generation.</p>
                        <p>Air Force Chief Mohammad Khatami, the military man with perhaps the most
                            influence on the Shah, provides a good illustration of other routes to
                            elite status. <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName>, unlike the
                            majority of general officers, was a provincial-from Resht on the
                            Caspian. His father owned a tea house, a humble enough occupation but
                            one which could produce a modest degree of wealth. The father apparently
                            began to deal in real estate-land speculation in Iran has long been a
                            way to quick wealth-and was able to send his son to the American High
                            School in Tehran. Entrance was probably facilitated by the fact that
                            Mohammad's mother was a relative of the Iman Jomeh, a prestigious
                            religious figure in Tehran who is related to Nasr ed-Din Shah Qajar <pb n="25" xml:id="d180-25" facs="d180-25"/> (assassinated in 1896).
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName> attended the military
                            high school and the air force branch of the military college; he was
                            commissioned in 1941. After training in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> he became the Shah's personal pilot, a duty which he
                            apparently continued as he moved into command jobs in the air force. He
                            piloted the plane in which the Shah fled from Iran in August 1953 as a
                            result of his dispute with Mossadeq. <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName> was promoted over contemporaries and some senior
                            officers to commander of the air force in 1958 holding this post longer
                            than any other force commander.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName> began to build a family
                            network by marrying about 1950 a cousin who was also related to the Iman
                            Jomeh. This wife was killed accidently in 1957 during a firing
                            demonstration, but two years later <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">Khatami</persName> married the Shah's half-sister, Princess
                            Fatimeh. He has prospered greatly since. He is now chairman of the board
                            of the Iranian National Airlines, chief of the council of the Civil
                            Aviation Department, and reputedly co-owner of a construction company
                            which has obtained lucrative government contracts. He is a member of the
                            poker-playing dowreh that includes General Fardust and a prominent
                            contractor who may front for him in construction deals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Religious Leaders</p>
                        <p>Religion and religious leaders have played important political roles in
                            Iran from the earliest times. In the pre-Islamic era the Magi, a
                            priestly class, had charge of all justice. Justice, morality, and
                            religion were in fact inseparably connected. Doctrinally, it was held
                            that the top ranking clergy had the authority to judge a king accused of
                            criminal acts and that the head of the church had the right to choose
                            the successor to the throne from a list of close male relatives of a
                            deceased monarch. While the Moslem conquest of Iran changed religious
                            practices, basic relations between government and religion remained much
                            the same.</p>
                        <p>The Shiah* clergy-the ulama-play an important, but probably declining,
                            political role. Before World War I, the ulama collectively formed the
                            most self-conscious center of power outside the government. With the
                            spread of secular education and under direct and indirect assaults from
                            the government, the clergy have lost much of their political power.
                            Nevertheless, they maintain significant influence among the masses and
                            have a demonstrated capacity for troublemaking. Ever since Shiah Islam
                            was established as the state religion in the 16th century, the ulama
                            have continuously opposed each <pb n="26" xml:id="d180-26" facs="d180-26"/>succeeding monarch. Their opposition has a
                            theological basis, for in essence Shiah Islam considers all temporal
                            rulers as illegitimate and asserts that legitimate guidance in human
                            affairs can come only from the mojtaheds, the religious leaders. The
                            mojtaheds are the representatives on earth of the Imam-God's
                            spokesman-who is the sole source of authority. Each Shiah is required to
                            follow the teachings of a mojtahed. Applying this doctrine to the Shah
                            and other governmental officials, the clergy's view is that the state
                            should ultimately be no more than their executive arm.</p>
                        <p>*Shi‘ism, a heterodox form of Islam, is the dominant sect and, in effect,
                            the "orthodoxy" of Iran.</p>
                        <p>Other factors have served to strengthen the clergy's hand. The central
                            Shiah leadership has always been in Iraq and thus beyond the immediate
                            reach of the government in Tehran; the clergy has had control of large
                            sums of money, derived from a religious tithe that is not subject to
                            government control; and until recent times, the clergy had almost
                            exclusive control of law courts and education. The clergy, itself
                            fiercely xenophobic, has also been prominently identified with popular
                            anti-foreign causes. The mojtaheds have been held in high regard by most
                            Iranians, if not the most influential, and have developed close ties
                            with the guilds and bazaar merchants, groups that have also felt
                            themselves to be victims of the political elite.'</p>
                        <p>The ulama reached the peak of their influence in the 19th and early 20th
                            century. They were instrumental in persuading the shah to launch the
                            second Russo-Turkish war in 1827, and in 1872 they forced Nasr ed-Din
                            Shah to cancel a concession to the British and dismiss the reform-minded
                            prime minister who negotiated it. Late in the century they led a
                            successful mass movement against another British concession, and in 1906
                            they formed an unlikely coalition with political radicals to force a
                            constitution on a reluctant shah. More recently, religious leaders were
                            prominent in agitation against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951-53,
                            and they have been constant and virulent critics of the Shah's reform
                            programs on the grounds that such reforms violated religious
                            principles.</p>
                        <p>Detailed information on the clergy is not available. There are perhaps
                            100,000 clergymen ranging from the mullah, the lowest clerical post, to
                            the mojtahed. There are, in addition, para-religious personnel, such as
                            prayer writers, chanters, and Koran readers. A few years ago, annual
                            income from property controlled by the clergy was estimated at $30
                            million, and this was in addition to tithing for which no estimate is
                            available. One prominent mojtahed is said to distribute about $200,000 a
                            month to clergymen dependent on him, to support religious students, and
                            to provide food for the poor.</p>

                        <p>Probably no more than 10 percent of the clergy who receive government
                            support can be counted as outright supporters of the Shah. They are
                            probably the least influential of the clergy and are considered by many
                            to be no better than government employees. Probably 50 percent are in
                            outright opposition to the government and are wholly dependent on their
                            popular following for support; this includes nearly every religious
                            leader of any stature. The remaining 40 percent qualify as
                            fence-sitters, maintaining a popular following but avoiding overt
                            attacks on the government.</p>
                        <p>Every monarch has had to come to terms with the religious leaders. Until
                            the <persName>Pahlavi</persName> period, the clergy generally were able
                            to exert great pressure on government. <persName>Reza</persName> Shah,
                            in his drive to centralize power and modernize Iran, could brook no
                            opposition and moved directly and forcefully to eliminate the political
                            power of the mojtaheds. Mohammed Reza Shah, of necessity, has followed
                            much the same course.</p>
                        <p>Unlike his father, however, the present Shah appears to admit at least
                            the latent power of the clergy. He makes a public show of piety and on
                            appropriate occasions visits religious shrines and contributes to
                            religious causes. He even claims divine protection, pointing to the two
                            unsuccessful assassination attempts as proof. Rather than indiscriminate
                            suppression, he has attempted to win to his point of view those
                            religious leaders who he thinks are open to persuasion.</p>
                        <p>The Shah acts forcefully, however, against those clergymen who openly
                            take a strong position against him. Ayatollah Khomeini, whose arrest
                            touched off serious riots in 1963, was forced into exile in Turkey and
                            later into Iraq. Others have been held under house arrest, and at least
                            one is reported to have died in prison. As in other cases, the Shah
                            holds out the promise of rewards for cooperation together with the near
                            certainty of harsh punishment for opposition. On the whole, the clergy
                            seem to have bent less than other elements of Iranian society.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Embassy for several years has been maintaining discreet
                            contacts with various members of the clergy, but the Soviet intention
                            appears to be primarily to gain access to the masses for pro-Soviet,
                            anti-Western propaganda.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Professional Bureaucratic Intelligentsia</p>
                        <p>The spread of education in Iran is providing the trained manpower the
                            Shah needs to draw up and run his industrialization programs, staff his
                                <pb n="29" xml:id="d180-29" facs="d180-29"/>bureaucracy, and man his
                            armed forces. Through education many persons of middle- or lower-class
                            origins are moving into positions of power and influence. The system in
                            which they must operate, however, continues to be the traditional one
                            based on family, wealth, influence, ability to maneuver, and tight
                            control by the few.</p>
                        <p>The major question, which may remain unresolved for as much as a
                            generation, is whether the traditional system will be able to adjust and
                            absorb the professional bureaucratic intelligentsia* into the elite or
                            whether this intelligentsia will force a really revolutionary change in
                            the way Iran has been ruled for centuries.</p>
                        <p>* This group is defined as those who have a modern education, are highly
                            skilled in a particular area or field, and are engaged in bureaucratic,
                            i.e., non-entrepreneurial jobs. Until 1900 only a handful of Iranians
                            had received a modern education or studied abroad; these few were
                            absorbed into the system. In 1922 there were 91 students in institutions
                            of higher learning in Iran, in 1953-54 there were nearly 10,000, and in
                            1970 there were nearly 70,000. Most of the current student group is of
                            middle- or lower-class origin.</p>
                        <p>The present Shah, utilizing the flexibility of the system, has been able
                            to coopt many of today's technocrats and set them to work constructively
                            within the system. By making available to them the rewards of class,
                            status, and power, he has persuaded many that the only alternative to
                            using their skills to benefit their country is protracted and fruitless
                            opposition or permanent exile abroad. The Shah well realizes the
                            strength of this sort of appeal. In a conversation with a foreigner, the
                            Shah-asked if he knew that members of the Literacy Corps were subverting
                            their pupils-replied "Don't worry, we know just who those young men are
                            and will be offering them high-level jobs as appropriate.”</p>
                        <p>The influx of the professional-bureaucratic intelligentsia into the elite
                            and near elite positions has aroused some resentment on the part of the
                            traditional families. One member of a family so old that he considers
                            both the Qajars and the Pahlavis to be upstarts has described many
                            rising army officers as "hamami,” bath house attendants, because their
                            social origins are so low.</p>
                        <p>The two political parties approved and supported by the Shah draw much of
                            their membership from the new intelligentsia. The limited political
                            participation provided by these parties may satisfy to some extent the
                            desire of the intelligentsia for such activity. In general, however,
                            those intelligentsia who work in the system realize that genuine
                            political activity is foreclosed for them, and for many this must
                            reinforce the cynicism which is such a marked feature of all levels of
                            the Iranian elite.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary and Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The rapid military buildup of the radical Arab States after the 1967
                            Arab-Israeli War and the British withdrawal of military forces from the
                            Persian Gulf prompted the Shah to undertake a rapid expansion and
                            modernization of Iran's armed forces. He has been particularly anxious
                            to keep pace with the rapidly modernized forces of neighboring Iraq.
                            During the past five years, Tehran has ordered more than $1.4 billion
                            worth of arms from abroad.</p>
                        <p>2. Since the mid-1960s, Iran has diversified its sources of arms, and the
                            United States no longer is the sole provider. Iran now meets most of its
                            requirements for naval craft, air defense equipment, and tanks from the
                            United Kingdom, while other Western suppliers provide an assortment of
                            equipment ranging from small arms and antiaircraft guns to helicopters
                            and transport aircraft. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            become an important source of ground forces equipment. The United
                            States, however, still accounts for one-half of Iran's arms purchases.
                            Moreover, Tehran continues to increase its purchases from the United
                            States and to depend on this country for all of its fighter aircraft and
                            most other sophisticated weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>3. Since January 1967, when the first arms accord with the Soviet Union
                            was concluded, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has emerged as
                            Iran's third largest arms supplier. The Soviet contribution has been
                            confined to artillery, armored personnel carriers, and support
                            equipment. Tehran generally has been satisfied with this equipment and
                            views its payment in natural gas as a way of saving hard currency. The
                            Shah prefers not to purchase sophisticated arms from Moscow because of
                            the dependence it creates for technical assistance, parts, and
                            replacement. He probably will continue to restrict purchases from the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to standard ground forces
                            equipment as long as he can continue to procure sophisticated weaponry
                            from the West.</p>

                        <p>4. The Shah's efforts to expand Iran's military capabilities, combined
                            with cutbacks in US military grant aid, have brought Iran's military
                            budget to almost four times its 1966 level. If defense spending
                            continued to expand at the present rate, it could absorb as much as
                            one-fourth of Iran's gross national product by 1975. It is more likely,
                            however, that procurement—while remaining high—will level off before
                            that time, and Tehran should be able to finance the foreign exchange
                            costs of military imports without difficulty from increased oil
                            revenues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Magnitude and Motivations</p>
                        <p>5. Iran has imported nearly $1.8 billion of military equipment since the
                            mid-1950s, making it the sixth largest arms recipient in the Third
                            World. The United States has provided 79% and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> 13% (see Table 1). Iranian arms
                            purchases during the past five years total some $1.4 billion, most of
                            which remains to be delivered. Tehran's efforts to obtain arms in the
                            early 1950s were motivated by fears of Soviet aggression and internal
                            security needs. Iran joined the US-sponsored Baghdad Pact (subsequently
                            renamed the Central Treaty Organization—<gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>) through which it received almost all of its arms and
                            training. These arms came from the United States and were provided as
                            grants.</p>
                        <p>6. Concerned with the cutbacks in US military aid and with the embargo
                            placed on arms deliveries to Pakistan (another <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> member) after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Iran
                            began in the mid-1960s to diversify its sources of arms, concluding
                            sizable agreements with West European countries and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The latter reflected the Shah's
                            declining fear of Soviet aggression and the strengthening of diplomatic
                            and economic ties between the two countries. The Shah's primary concern
                            shifted to the arms buildup in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria and NASSER's
                            efforts to expand his influence into the Persian Gulf area.</p>
                        <p>7. The recent spurt of Iranian arms purchases has been generated by
                            Tehran's effort to upgrade its military forces and fill the vacuum left
                            by the withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf. Although the
                            Egyptian threat has receded, the Shah is concerned with the possible
                            emergence of new radical influences in the area, particularly those
                            supported by Iraq. The Shah regards a modern, well-equipped military
                            establishment as essential to deter hostile Iraqi moves, to further
                            Iranian interests, and to assure Iranian control of the Gulf.</p>

                        <p>8. The United States has provided Iran with about $1.4 billion of arms
                            between 1955 and 1971.(1) More than $700 million was exported to Iran
                            during 1967-71. More than one-half of total US arms exports has been
                            furnished as grant aid under the Military Assistance Program (<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>) (see Table 2).</p>
                        <p>(1) South Vietnam, South Korea, the Republic of China, and Turkey are the
                            only less developed countries that have received more US military
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>9. US military interest in Iran began during World War II, when it served
                            largely as a distribution center for supplies to the Soviet Union. A US
                            military mission was established in mid-1942 to train the Iranian Army
                            and Gendarmerie, and Iran subsequently received some Lend-Lease aid.
                            Additional aid was provided immediately after the war to help Tehran
                            counter the Soviet-supported separatist movements in the provinces

                            the Baghdad Pact in 1955.(2) When Iraq withdrew from the alliance in
                            1959, Iran signed a bilateral defense agreement with the United States
                            and joined with Turkey, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom to form <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. As a member of US-backed military

                            some $50 million annually during the 1960s.</p>

                        <p>11. Because of Iran's high rate of economic growth and sizable oil
                            revenues, the US economic aid program was terminated in November 1967,
                            and the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program began phasing out.
                            Virtually all military hardware programmed under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> had been delivered by the end of 1969. The only <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance authorized thereafter was to
                            support the US Military Assistance Advisory Group stationed in Iran and
                            to train Iranian military personnel.</p>
                        <p>12. Iran began to purchase US arms with Foreign Military Sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>) credits on a regular basis in 1964,
                            when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the United States
                            allowing the procurement of $200 million of equipment. The Memorandum
                            was amended in 1966 to permit purchases of as much as $470 million ($400
                            million on credit and $70 million for cash) through 1970. In 1971 the
                            Export-Import Bank extended an additional $420 million in credits for
                            arms purchases.(3) Repayment is being made over seven years at 7.25%
                            interest. In addition, Iran purchased $27 million of equipment directly
                            from US manufacturers for cash.</p>
                        <p>(3) Previously, the Department of Defense arranged the financing with the
                            Export-Import Bank and commercial banks. The Export-Import Bank now
                            handles all such financing directly.</p>
                        <p>13. Iran has received a wide range of US military equipment, but recent
                            contracts have consisted largely of sophisticated military hardware,
                            including 73 F-4 supersonic jet fighters and 30 C-130 transports (see
                            Table 3). Most equipment purchased in 1971 is scheduled to arrive in
                            Iran during 1972-74. Iranian purchases in 1972 are expected to exceed
                            $200 million and may include more than 140 F-5 jet fighters,
                            self-propelled howitzers, and the TOW anti-tank missile system. Thus,
                            despite the decline in the US share of the Iranian arms market from
                            nearly 100% prior to 1966 to 56% of total deliveries in 1971, Tehran
                            continues to increase its purchases from the United States and to depend
                            on them for most of its sophisticated weapons systems.</p>

                        <p>14. Iran's arms purchases from the United Kingdom, which began early in
                            1966, have totaled $570 million (see Table 4). Deliveries have been
                            small thus far—about $70 million by the end of 1971—but Iran will begin
                            receiving deliveries of sizable quantities of equipment in 1972. These
                            purchases were facilitated by London's willingness to sell sophisticated
                            weaponry and to provide favorable financing—credits averaging about
                            seven years with interest rates ranging between 5% and 6.5%.</p>

                        <p>15. Tehran's first purchase of sophisticated weapons from the United
                            Kingdom was of the Seacat/Tigercat surface-to-air missile (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>) system in July 1966. Iran subsequently
                            purchased the Rapier low-level <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            system and a radar net to cover southern Iran.</p>
                        <p>16. The British also have become a major source of naval and ground
                            forces equipment. In 1966, Tehran purchased four Mark V destroyer
                            escorts, with delivery scheduled to begin in mid-1972. Iran also has
                            bought 16 hovercraft from the United Kingdom, some of which may be armed
                            with missiles, thereby becoming the first country in the world to
                            establish a military hovercraft fleet. During 1971 the Shah, concerned
                            with Iraq's possession of Soviet T-55 tanks, purchased 770 Chieftain
                            tanks. Iran is the first less developed country to receive this
                            sophisticated main battle tank.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Western Sources of Arms</p>
                        <p>17. Iran has purchased almost $160 million of arms in recent years from
                            other Western suppliers (see Table 5), and some $70 million of this has
                            been received. Purchases from Italian arms dealers have reached almost
                            $60 million. The acquisitions from Italy initially were limited to
                            ammunition and support equipment, but in 1968-69 the Augusta Bell
                            Company sold Iran 100 AB-206 and 44 AB-205 helicopters with deliveries
                            scheduled through 1972. The helicopters are being assigned to the
                            Gendarmerie's aviation battalion, the Air Force, and the Navy's air arm.
                            The AB-206s ordered for the Navy are to be armed with wire-guided
                            air-to-surface missiles and are used to support the coastal patrol
                            activities of the hovercraft fleet. In 1970, six SH-3D helicopters were
                            purchased for the Navy and 16 CH-47C helicopters as troop transporters
                            for the Army.</p>

                        <p>18. Iran has purchased nearly $50 million of arms from Switzerland,
                            including 150 radar- controlled, twin-barrel 35-mm Oerlikon antiaircraft
                            guns. Small quantities of military equipment, largely support equipment
                            and ammunition, have also been obtained from Israel, Belgium, Canada,
                            the Netherlands, Norway, and West Germany. In one agreement, Israel sold
                            Iran Soviet artillery, small arms, ammunition, and related spare parts
                            captured during the June 1967 War. The Dutch have provided 14 F-27
                            transport aircraft to be delivered in 1972. The only equipment purchased
                            from France was some $2 million worth of anti-tank missiles and
                            communications equipment. Paris, however, continues to pressure Iran to
                            purchase Mirage III aircraft, reportedly offering as an inducement to
                            construct a Mirage spare parts plant in Iran that would be licensed to
                            sell throughout the Middle East.</p>

                        <p>19. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Iran's third largest arms
                            supplier, has extended at least $370 million in military aid since
                            January 1967 under seven separate agreements (see Table 6). Some $235
                            million had been delivered by the end of 1971 on credits that will be
                            repaid largely in natural gas over eight years, probably at 2.5%
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>20. The Shah's acceptance of Soviet arms reflected his declining fear of
                            Soviet intentions toward Iran and the general rapproachement between the
                            two countries that began early in the 1960s. Iran had accepted some
                            Soviet economic aid in 1963, and by 1966 agreed to a major Soviet
                            program that included the construction of a steel mill and a natural gas
                            pipeline to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This arrangement
                            was followed in January 1967 by Tehran's first arms agreement with
                            Moscow. The accord totaled $110 million and marked the first acquisition
                            of Soviet arms by a country in a Western military alliance. A second
                            arms accord signed later that year totaled some $40 million. Both
                            agreements covered only ground forces equipment, including some 700
                            armored personnel carriers, 8,500 other vehicles, 600 23-mm and 80 57-mm
                            antiaircraft guns, and spare parts and ammunition.(4)</p>

                        <p>21. About half the equipment ordered had been delivered by the beginning
                            of 1969. A third accord—also for $40 million—was signed early in 1969
                            and contained about the same types of equipment as the earlier
                            agreements. Tehran was interested in obtaining the Soviet 23-mm
                            self-propelled, radar-controlled antiaircraft gun (ZSU-23-4), but Moscow
                            claimed that it was not available at that time, because the entire
                            production of the weapon was being used to meet higher priority needs.
                            Iran declined a Soviet offer of MIG-21 jet fighters, Komar-class guided
                            missile patrol boats, and 1-55 medium tanks.</p>
                        <p>22. Two arms accords were signed in 1970 totaling some $135 million.
                            Among the new types of equipment ordered were 136 130-mm (M-46) field
                            guns and 1,500 RPG-7 recoilless anti-tank rocket launchers. The decision
                            to purchase the field gun reportedly was prompted by Iraq's possession
                            of the same weapon. The RPG-7 was acquired to provide troops with an
                            anti-tank defense and was chosen in place of the more costly and
                            sophisticated Sagger anti-tank missile system. Iran also obtained a
                            license to produce 23-mm ammunition. The Shah finally obtained 30
                            ZSU-23-4 antiaircraft guns under a $25 million agreement concluded in
                            August 1971.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Technical Assistance</p>
                        <p>23. Iran depends mostly on Western countries for technical assistance.
                            The overwhelming share of military technicians in Iran are US personnel,
                            while training of Iranians abroad is done principally in the United
                            Kingdom (see Table 7). Training at military schools in other countries
                            ranges from equipment maintenance and flight training to staff planning.
                            The numberof Iranians attending courses in non-US facilities has
                            increased greatly since the mid-1960s, as Iran has diversified its arms
                            procurement. The training provided by Pakistan and Turkey generally is

                        <p>24. Iran has made little use of Soviet technical assistance, preferring
                            to limit Moscow's contacts with Iranian military personnel. Only a small
                            number of Soviet technicians are in Iran, largely assembling and testing
                            newly delivered Soviet equipment. Tehran has sent only about 135
                            Iranians to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, mainly to learn
                            equipment operation and maintenance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Domestic Defense Production</p>
                        <p>25. Indigenous production represents only a small share of Iran's total
                            defense procurement. Two facilities in the Tehran area supply most of
                            the domestically produced military hardware. The Mosalsalsazi plant has
                            an annual capacity of 30,000 G-3 rifles and 5,000 MG-1 machineguns of
                            West German design. The Saltanatabad facility produces small arms
                            ammunition, 81-mm and 120-mm mortar shells, 105-mm artillery shells,
                            20-mm cannon ammunition, grenades, signal flares, and anti-tank and
                            anti-personnel mines.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d181-12" facs="d181-12"/>
                        <p>26. Iran has been anxious to expand domestic arms production as part of
                            its diversification efforts. The West German firms Fritz Werner AG and
                            Rhein Stahl AG have been assisting in a modernization program, and much
                            of the pre-World War II machinery in the two Iranian munitions plants
                            has been replaced. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed in 1970 to permit Iran to manufacture 23-mm
                            antiaircraft ammunition under license. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> suggested, however, that the necessary production
                            machinery be obtained from Czechoslovakia. The planned facility will
                            produce half a million rounds per year and would be in operation within
                            two years after delivery of equipment. A tank retrofit plant that would
                            modernize the more than 400 M-47 tanks in Iran's inventory was scheduled
                            to be completed in March 1972. The facility eventually will be able to
                            assemble tanks from US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            components.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact of Iran's Defense Spending on the
                            Budget</p>
                        <p>27. The expansion of Iran's military purchases, combined with cutbacks in
                            US military grant aid, caused Iran's defense expenditures to jump from
                            an average of about $255 million annually during 1963-65 to almost $1.2
                            billion in 1971 (see Table 8). Defense outlays now account for about 10%
                            of Iran's gross national product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>)
                            and about 30% of the total central government budget. If defense
                            spending continues to grow at its present rate—an average of 30%
                            annually since 1966—it could absorb some 25% of Iran's <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> by 1975. It is more likely, however,
                            that such outlays, while remaining high, will level off before
                            then.(5)</p>

                        <p>28. Estimated payments for foreign military hardware rose from an average
                            of $5 million annually during 1963-65 to $18 million in 1966 and
                            rocketed to $191 million in 1971. These expenditures accounted for 16%
                            of defense spending in 1971. Other defense and defense-related
                            imports—such as construction materials and equipment supplies for
                            military installations—could represent another 20%.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Iran-Iraq Arms Balance</p>
                        <p>29. Iran's arms requirements are, to a large extent, based on what Tehran
                            considers necessary to counter Iraq's activities in the area. Since
                            Iraq's monarchy was overthrown in 1958, relations between the two
                            countries have ranged from cool to openly hostile. During periods of
                            poor relations, Iran has supplied arms, money, and transit rights to
                            dissident Iraqi Kurds and has looked for other ways to shake the Baghdad
                            government. In turn, Iraq has permitted raids into Iran by dissident
                            Iranian Kurds resident in Iraq and has provided assistance to the
                            Khuzestan Liberation Front and other subversive groups. The diversion of
                            the waters of the Shatt al Arab, the river which separates the two
                            countries in the south, has again become a source of irritation and even
                            armed skirmishes along the border. Although both countries have
                            reinforced their border outposts, they are reluctant to escalate such
                            incidents.</p>

                        <p>30. The Shah is concerned about the $1.1 billion of aggregate Communist
                            military aid commitments to Baghdad and the $250 million modernization
                            program Moscow currently is implementing. Iraq has received more than 90
                            MIG-21 supersonic jet fighters, more than 60 SU-7 jet fighter-bombers,
                            some 800 T54/55 medium tanks, about 1,350 armored personnel carriers,
                            various naval craft, and substantial quantities of artillery. (For the
                            major military inventories of Iran and Iraq, see Table 9). However, the
                            Iranian armed forces are believed to be superior to Iraq's, both in the
                            quantity of arms and the quality of its personnel.</p>

                        <p>31. After the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, Iran acted as an arms purchasing
                            agent for Pakistan, which was having difficulty obtaining military
                            equipment in the West. Iran purchased some 90 F-86 jet fighters,
                            air-to-air missiles, artillery, ammunition, and spare parts from a West
                            German arms dealer. The aircraft were delivered to Iran and then flown
                            into Pakistan. Most of the other equipment was delivered directly to
                            Karachi.</p>
                        <p>32. In the spring of 1971, Iran loaned Pakistan about a dozen helicopters
                            and other military equipment for use in West Pakistan to replace similar
                            equipment transferred to East Pakistan. Additional supplies, including
                            artillery, ammunition, and spare parts, were sent to Pakistan when
                            Indian troops entered the East Pakistan civil war. Since the 1971
                            Indo-Pakistani War, there have been reports that Iran may again act as
                            an arms purchasing agent for Islamabad if Pakistan cannot obtain Western
                            military equipment and spare parts.</p>

                        <p>PRESIDENT WILL BE VISITING IRAN WHERE ATMOSPHERE IS MIXTURE OF PRIDE,
                            CONFIDENCE AND ANXIETY—ROUGHLY IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. PRIDE.</p>
                        <p>THERE IS IMMENSE FEELING OF PRIDE—PARTICULARLY AT TOP LEVELS BUT ALSO
                            INCREASINGLY AMONG GENERAL POPULACE (WHERE, AS RESULT OF PRE-1920
                            HISTORY THERE HAS LONG BEEN STRONG ELEMENT OF CYNICISM OR DOUBT RE IRANS
                            ABILITY CATCH-UP WITH MODERN WORLD OF WEST OR CONTROL ITS OWN
                            DESTINY)—IN</p>
                        <p>1. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL STABILITY ACHIEVED OVER PAST
                            DECADE: E.G., A PRIME MINISTER NOW IN EIGHTH YEAR WITH NO MAJOR
                            GOVERNMENT SHAKE-UPS OR THREATS TO STABILITY OVER SAME PERIOD: GROWTH
                            RATE OF MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OVER PAST FIVE YEARS, WITH 12 TO 13
                            PERCENT RATE REALISTICALLY EXPECTED IN CURRENT IRANIAN YEAR.</p>
                        <p>2. FACT THAT IRAN, SINCE LATE 1960'S HAS BEEN PAYING OWN WAY (I.E.
                            DEVELOPMENT HAS NOT DEPENDED UPON FOREIGN AID OR ASSISTANCE—WITH MINOR
                            EXCEPTIONS WHICH JUST BARELY INCLUDE US) AND HAS <pb n="2" xml:id="d182-02" facs="d182-02"/>ACHIEVED AN INTERNATIONAL STATUS
                            AND POWER WHICH MAKE IT COUNTRY TO BE RECKONED WITH IN REGIONAL
                            CONTEXT.</p>
                        <p>THIS PRICE IS BOLSTERED WHEN IRANIANS COMPARE THEIR RECORD OF RECENT PAST
                            WITH THAT OF ANY OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRY, PARTCULARLY COUNTRIES IN AREA
                            STRETCHING FROM SOUTH EAST ASIA TO EUROPEAN MAINLAND.</p>
                        <p>THIS PRIDE HAS GENERATED NOT ONLY FEELING OF EQUALITY TOWARD FOREIGN
                            COUNTRIES BUT ALSO FEELING THAT IRAN HAS, AT LONG LAST, ARRIVED ON
                            INTERNATIONAL SCENE AND SHOULD NOW BE REGARDED AS MODERN, PROGRESSIVE
                            AND RESPONSIBLE MEMBER IN COMMUNITY OF NATIONS. THIS WAS, IN OUR VIEW,
                            ESSENTIAL MESSAGE WHICH SHAH SOUGHT TO GET ACROSS TO HIS PEOPLE AND
                            WORLD BY 25TH CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS LAST FALL.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. CONFIDENCE.</p>
                        <p>THERE IS ALSO WIDE-SPREAD CONFIDENCE AT UPPER LEVELS HERE THAT IRAN'S (1)
                            STRONG AND FAR-SIGHTED LEADERSHIP: (2) WEALTH OF HUMAN TALENT AT
                            DISPOSAL OF LEADERSHIP (E.G. 19 OUR OF 24 CABINET MINISTERS, AS WELL AS
                            LARGE NUMBER SUB— CABINET LEVEL OFFICIALS, HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN
                            WEST—MANY WITH HIGHER DEGREES): (3) CAPACITY TO MANAGE IMPORTANT NATURAL
                            RESOURCES (PRIMARILY OIL BUT ALSO OTHERS) IN WHAT THAT THEY ARE BEING
                            TRANSFORMED FROM POTENTIAL INTO ACTUAL AND USEABLE WEALTH, AND (4)
                            MANAGEABLE POPULATION GROWTH PROBLEM—ALL COMBINE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR
                            IRAN TO CONTINUE ENJOY REMARKABLE GROWTH AND STABILITY OF PAST DECADE
                            AND, AT SAME TlME, BUILD UP MODERN AND EFFICIENT MILITARY FORCE REQUIRED
                            TO HELP COUNTER EFFORTS TO BRING VITAL PERSIAN GULF UNDER CONTROL OF
                            FORCE HOSTILE TO IRAN AND WEST.</p>
                        <p>THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT TOP LEVELS FAIL TO RECOGNIZE RAPID ECONOMIC AND
                            SOCIAL ADVANCES ARE PRODUCING INCREASING PROBLEMS AND PRESSURES, E.G.
                            FOR MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH PARTICULARLY AS BETWEEN RURAL
                            AND URBAN POPULATION: FOR MORE WIDE-SPREAD PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNING
                            PROCESS: FOR GREATER FREEDOM DISCUSSING/ESPOUSING ALTERATIVES TO PRESENT
                            GOVERNMENT POLICIES. FOR MORE AND BETTER EDUCATION FACILITIES, ETC. BUT
                            TOP LEVELS PARTICULARLY SHAH, FACE SUCH PROBLEMS AND PRESSURES WITH
                            FEELING THEY ARE INEVITABLE PART OF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS: (B) THEY CAN BE
                            EFFECTIVELY COUNTERED BY TIMELY GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AND REFORMS: <pb n="3" xml:id="d182-03" facs="d182-03"/>AND (C) THUS, THEY DO NOT AND
                            WILL NOT THREATEN EITHER BASIC POLITICAL STABILITY OR ECONOMIC/SOCIAL
                            GROWTH. (ALTHOUGH WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TO FOCUS MORE ACTIVELY AND INTENSELY ON ACTIONS AND
                            REFORMS NEEDED TO COUNTER SUCH PRESSURES, WE BASICALLY SHARE THIS
                            GENERAL FEELING.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. ANXIETY.</p>
                        <p>DESPITE SOURCES OF PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE NOTED ABOVE, THERE ARE ALSO TWO
                            STRONG ELEMENTS OF ANXIETY IN CURRENT IRAN.</p>
                        <p>1. AMONG TOP LEVELS, THERE IS GREAT ANXIETY RELATED TO DEVELOPMENTS IN
                            AREAS SURROUNDING IRAN AND POSSIBLE OVER-FLOW EFFECTS WITHIN IRAN (E.G.
                            IRAQI-INSTIGATED SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM)—WITH PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH
                            OTHER COUNTRES HOSTILE TO IRAN AND EXPLOITING SITUATIONS OF WEAKNESS TO
                            SOUTH (IN GULF) AND EAST (AFGHANISTAN AND DISMEMBERED PAKISTAN), TO
                            "ENCIRCLE" IRAN AND REDUCE OR REMOVE WESTERN INFLUENCE FROM AREA RUSSIA
                            HAS HISTORICALLY WANTED AS SPECIAL BAILWICK. (THIS CONCERN WILL BE
                            DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN SEPARTE MESSAGE.)</p>
                        <p>2. IN ADDITION, JUST BELOW TOP LEVELS, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY THAT
                            (A) IRAN'S STABILITY AND PROGRESS ARE TOO EXCLUSIVELY DEPENDENT UPON
                            SHAH'S FIRM LEADERSHIP: (B) THAT HIS PREMATURE REMOVAL FROM SCENE COULD
                            PLUNG IRAN BACK INTO PERIOD OF SERIOUS POLITICAL TURMOIL AND INSTABILITY
                            AND BRING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS TO HALT: AND (C) THAT SHAH, IN
                            HIS IMPATIENCE TO MOVE COUNTRY AHEAD NOW, IS FAILING TO PREPARE
                            INSTITUIONS AND LEADERS THAT COULD MAKE TRANSITION TO POST-SHAH IRAN
                            WITHOUT SERIOUS POLITICAL TURMOIL AND WITHOUT SERIOUS DAMAGE TO SOCIAL
                            AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS. (THERE IS, IN OUR VIEW, UNDOUBTEDLY REASON FOR
                            CONCERN ON THIS SCORE, AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF PRESIDENT COULD
                            DISCREETLY ENCOURAGE SHAH TO GIVE GREATER THOUGHT NOW TO INSTITUTIONAL
                            AND LEADERSHIP REQUIREMENTS OF FUTURE WITHOUT HIM. AT SAME TIME, WE DO
                            NOT BELIEVE PREMATURE REMOVAL OF SHAH FROM SCENE WOULD PRODUCE
                            CONSEQUENCES AS SERIOUS AS THOSE OUTLINED ABOVE. OUR NUTSHELL PROGNOSIS
                            FOR BALANCE OF THIS DECADE IS: IF SHAH REMAINS AT HELM (AS EXPECTED),
                            CHANCES THAT IRAN WILL CONTINUE REMARKABLE POLITICAL STABILITY AND
                            GROWTH OF PAST DECADE ARE EXCELENT: IF SHAH REMOVED FROM SCENE, CHANCES
                            WOULD BE REDUCED—BUT STILL GOOD.) <pb n="4" xml:id="d182-04" facs="d182-04"/>IN SUM, PRSIDENTIAL VISIT WILL TAKE PLACE AT TIME
                            WHEN SHAH VERY LIKELY:</p>
                        <p>(A) POINT WITH PRIDE TO IRAN AS ONLY (LEAVING ASIDE ISRAEL) STRONG,
                            STABLE AND PROGRESSIVE COUNTRY WITH FRIENDSHIP FOR US— IN REGION BETWEEN
                            SOUTHEAST ASIA AND EUROPEAN NATO WHICH IS OTHERWISE BESET WITH POLITICAL
                            TURMOIL OR INSTABILITY, WEAKNESS, SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS OR
                            SERIOUS DIFFERENCES WITH U.S.</p>
                        <p>(B) STRESS TO PRESIDENT THAT IRAN IS ONLY COUNTRY IN REGION WHICH IS BOTH
                            FRIENDLY TO U.S. AND HAS WILL AND CAPACITY TO HELP ACT AS COUNTER TO
                            INTERNATIONAL FORCES WHICH THREATEN MIDDLE EAST AND ARE ATTEMPTING BRING
                            PERSIAN GULF AND ITS VITAL OIL RESOURCES UNDER CONTROL OF HANDS HOSTILE
                            TO WEST AND IRAN, AND</p>
                        <p>(C) GIVEN PRINCIPAL ANXIETY ON HIS MIND, BE PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN

                        <p>THIS IS THIRD IN SERIES OF MESSAGES REGARDING PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND DEALS
                            WITH PRESENT STATE OF US/IRAN RELATIONS AND MATTERS SHAH MAY RAISE WITH
                            PRESIDENT IN THIS CONTEXT.</p>
                        <p>1. PRESIDENT WILL COME TO IRAN AT TIME WHEN SHAH HAS CHARACTERIZED
                            US/IRANIAN RELATIONS AS NEVER HAVING BEEN BETTER. RELATIONS ARE CLOSE,
                            WE DERIVE CONSIDERABLE BENEFIT FROM THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS (INTELLIGENCE
                            FACILITIES, SECURE AIR CORRIDOR, ETC.) AND US MISSION IS ABLE OPERATE IN
                            IRAN IN ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDLINESS AND COOPERATION, RARE IN THIS PART OF
                            WORLD. FURTHER, IRAN IS EXCELLENT CUSTOMER FOR US PRODUCTS.</p>
                        <p>2. WE ARE IN UNUSUAL STATE OF HAVING ONLY TWO BILATERAL ISSUES CURRENTLY
                            UNDER NEGOTIATION WITH <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>: CIVAIR
                            AGREEMENT AND LEND-LEASE DEBTS. HOPEFULLY, FORMER WILL BE RESOLVED AT
                            CONFERENCE TABLE IN NEXT FEW DAYS. PROGRESS IS BEING MADE, ON LATTER AS
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS ACKNOWLEDGED DEBT AND HAS
                            EXPRESSED WILLNGNESS IN PRINCIPLE TO PAY IT.</p>
                        <p>3. ON MULTILATERAL MATTERS IRAN RECORD OF COLLABORATION WITH <pb n="2" xml:id="d183-02" facs="d183-02"/> US IS GOOD. MOST RECENTLY ITS
                            DELEGATION TO SINGLE NARCOTICS CONVENTION IN GENEVA WHOLEHEARTEDLY
                            SUPPORTED OUR EFFORTS. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TRIES TO TAKE
                            OUR POINT OF VIEW INTO CONSIDERATION, IS GENERALLY RESPONSIVE TO OUR
                            SUGGESTIONS AND TRIES NOT TO TAKE POSITIONS THAT MIGHT EMBARRASS US.</p>
                        <p>4. THERE ARE MANY STRANDS IN FABRIC OF OUR RELATIONS WITH IRAN, ONE OF
                            MOST IMPORTANT BEING CONTACT SHAH HAS HAD WITH ALL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
                            SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMAN. HE GREATLY VALUES COMMUNICATING WITH AMERICAN
                            PRESIDENTS ON A PERSONAL AND INTIMATE BASIS AND AND HIS FORTHCOMING
                            DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>
                            SHOULD CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO STRENGTHENING FURTHER THIS BOND THAT
                            USG WAS HAD WITH SHAH OVER THE YEARS.</p>
                        <p>5. SHAH AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> LOOK UPON US AS IRAN'S
                            BEST AND MOST TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND. THIS IS VALUABLE PLUS FOR US INTERESTS
                            IN THIS STRATEGIC PART OF WORLD. THERE ARE ALSO OCCASIONAL IRRITANTS
                            THAT DEVELOP IN OUR RELATIONS THAT ARISE OUT OF EXPECTATIONS GENERATED
                            BY VERY TRUST AND SENSE OF DEEP FRIENDSHIP IRAN ACCORDS US. BECAUSE IRAN
                            IS SUCCESS STORY, PUTS NO DEMANDS UPON OUR RESOURCES AND CREATES NO
                            PROBLEMS FOR US THERE IS FEELING HERE THAT IRAN TENDS TO BE TAKEN FOR
                            GRANTED BY CRISIS-ORIENTED LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON. THERE IS ALSO
                            FEELING THAT US AT TIMES IS OVERLOOKING ONE OF ITS BEST FRIENDS AND MOST
                            SUCCESSFUL GRADUATES FROM GRANT MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID RELATIONSHIP,
                            BEING COUNTRY THAT HAS RESOURCES, PAYS ITS OWN WAY AND IS WILLING PLAY
                            RRESPONSIBLE IN AREA WHERE PEACE AND STABILITY ARE VITAL TO INTERESTS
                            AND FREE WORLD.</p>
                        <p>6. IRRITANTS ALSO DEVELOPE WHEN SHAH TURNS TO US, AS HE GENERALLY DOES
                            BEFORE CONSIDERING OTHERS, FOR INFORMATION OR EQUIPMENT TO MOVE HIS
                            COUNTRY FORWARD ECONOMICALLY AND STRENGTHEN ITS ARMED FORCES. HE WANTS
                            BEST MONEY CAN BUY, AND SINCE HE CONSIDERS PROGRESSIVE, STRONG AND
                            RRESPONSIBLE IRAN TO BE IN US INTERESTS HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND OUR
                            TENDENCEY TO SECOND-GUESS HIS REQUEST IN MILITARY FIELD OR OUR
                            RELUCTANCE AT TIMES TO SHARE WITH HIM OUR LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND WEAPONS
                            SYSTEMS, ETC. SO THAT HE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS OF HIS OWN ABOUT
                            REQUIREMENTS. IN HIS EXPERIENCE, AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE SEEN HIS NEEDS
                            CLEARLY BUT HE FINDS OUR BUREAUCRACY DOESN'T ALSO HAVE THE MESSAGE, AND
                            AGONIZING MONTHS CAN <pb n="3" xml:id="d183-03" facs="d183-03"/>GO BY
                            WHILE NEGOTIATING MATERS ON WHICH HE BELIEVES AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED
                            AT HIGHEST LEVELS OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. WE ANTICIPATE THIS EXPERIENCE CLEARLY INFLUENCES HIS APPROACH TO
                            PRESIDENT. WE EXPECT HE WILL RAISE NUMBER OF SPECIFIC SUBJECTS FOR
                            DECISION WITH PRESIDENT SUCH AS ACQUISITION OF F-15S, STEADY SUPPLY OF
                            SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL TO ADVISE HIS ARMED FORCES, ETC.</p>
                        <p>8. THE PRESIDENT WILL ALSO BE COMING TO TEHRAN AT TIME WHEN SHAH FEELS
                            HIMSELF SOMEWHAT ISOLATED AND DEEPLY TROUBLED ABOUT STATE OF WORLD
                            AROUND HIM. HE IS THEREFORE EVEN MORE DEPENDENT ON US AS CLOSE AND
                            TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND. SHAH IS CONCERNED OVER PRECARIOUS SITUATION THAT
                            CONFRONTS HIM ON HIS EASTERN, WESTERN AND SOUTHERN BORDERS, WITH
                            NEIGHBORS IN A STATE OF DISARRAY (PAKISTAN), FACING UNCERTAIN FUTURE
                            (AFGHANISTAN, SAUDI ARABIA, UAE, AND TURKEY) OR OPENLY HOSTILE (IRAQ AND
                            TO LESSER EXTENT KUWAIT). HE IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLED ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS
                            IN GULF AND RECOGNIZES THAT THIS AREA IS AS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TO
                            IRAN AS IT IS TO WEST. THROUGH GULF FLOWS WEALTH WHICH FINANCES SHAH'S
                            AMBITIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR HIS COUNTRY AND WHICH FUELS ECONOMIES
                            OF FREE WORLD. FUNDAMENTAL TO HIS CONCERNS IS HIS APPREHENSION OVER
                            SOVIET OBJECTIVES IN AREA AND USSR SUCCESS TO DATE IN ACHIEVING THEM. HE
                            POINTS OUT THAT HIS NEIGHBOR TO NORTH, WITH WHICH SUPERFICIALLY IRAN HAS
                            GOOD RELATIONS IN SPIRIT OF DETENTE, HAS FOR CENTURIES HAD THREE
                            HISTORICAL OBJECTIVES—A ROLE IN MEDITERRANEAN, PRESENCE IN SUBCONTINENT
                            AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, CONTROL IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER OF THE GULF AND
                            ITS RESOURCES. NOW THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE ACHIEVED FIRST TWO OBJECTIVES
                            SHAH FEELS THEY ARE CLOSING IN ON GULF. HE HAS ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE TO
                            SUPPORT HIS THESIS INCLUDING RECENT SOVIET/IRAQ TREATY, SOVIET PLANS TO
                            ESTABLISH NAVAL BASE AT UMM AL-QASR IN GULF, SOVIET EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH
                            DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH GULF STATES, ETC. IN ADDITION, HE SEES RADICAL
                            ARAB STATES SUCH AS IRAQ AND SOUTH YEMEN INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT UPON
                            SOVIETS AND RESPONSIVE TO MOSCOW GUIDANCE WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH
                            SOVIETS TO PENETRATE GULF STATES AND DIRECTLY OR THROUGH SUBVERSION,
                            TAKE OVER AREA TO ERADICATE WESTERN INFLUENCE, GAIN CONTROL OF,
                            PRODUCTION OF PRIMARY SOURCE OF FREE WORLD <pb n="4" xml:id="d183-04" facs="d183-04"/>PETROLEUM AND USE THIS CONTROL TO EXACT CONCESSIONS
                            FROM FREE WORLD.</p>
                        <p>9. WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT SHAH WILL PAINT FAIRLY BLEAK PICTURE TO
                            PRESIDENT OF WORLD AS HE SEES IT. HE IS A PROFESSIONAL CASSANDRA AND
                            PRIDES HIMSELF ON HAVING BEEN RIGHT IN HIS PREDITIONS. VISIT THEREFORE
                            COMES AT MOST OPPORTUNE TIME. SHAH WILL BE ANXIOUS TO HAVE PRSIDENT'S
                            ASSESSMENT OF SOVIET OBJECTIVES IN EUROPE, MEDITERRANEAN, MIDDLE EAST
                            AND SOUTH ASIA AND CLARIFICATION OF US VIEWS AND REACTIONS TO THESE
                            OBJECTIVES IN ORDER BETTER TO DETEMINE WHAT IRAN'S ROLE AND RESPONSE
                            SHOULD BE. HE WILL HOPE THAT FROM THESE DISCUSSIONS HE WILL BE ABLE
                            REAFFIRM HIS VIEW OF US AS TRUSTWORTHY RELIABLE AND DEPENDABLE FRIEND
                            PREPARED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SHAH'S NEEDS AS HE DEFINES THEM IN ORDER TO
                            PLAY RESPONSIBLE ROLE IN AREA IN FULL SPIRIT OF <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> DOCTRINE.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: THIS IS FOURTH IN A SERIES OF MESSAGES REGARDING PRESIDENT'S
                            VISIT TO TEHRAN AND COVERS SHAH'S VIEWS ON WIDE RANGE OF DOMESTIC AND
                            FOREIGN SUBJECTS. DOMESTICALLY, SHAH HAS SET AMBITIOUS DEVELOPMENT GOALS
                            AND IS BULLISH ABOUT HIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE. AT SAME TIME HE IS TROUBLED
                            OVER TREND OF EVENTS IN MIDDLE EAST, SOME OF WHICH HE CONSIDERS THREAT
                            TO IRAN'S SECURITY. HE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SOVIET ADVANCEMENTS IN
                            AREA AND OVER WHAT HE CALLS GRAND DESIGN OF <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> TO ACQUIRE WARM WATER PORT IN ARABIAN SEA AND TO
                            ERADICATE US AND WESTERN INFLUENCE IN GULF. HE FEELS US AND WEST DO NOT
                            APPRECIATE VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THEIR OWN BASIC SELF INTERESTS OF GULF
                            AND ITS OIL ON WHICH SO MUCH OF FREE WORLD ECONOMY AND SECURITY IS
                            DEPENDENT. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. REQUESTS FOR AUDIENCES WITH SHAH ARE CAREFULLY SCREENED, BUT ONCE ONE
                            IS GRANTED HE IS GENEROUS WITH VISITOR IN TIME AND SUBSTANCE OF HIS
                            REMARKS. HE LIKES TO START WITH TOUR D'HORIZON, LENGTH AND ORIENTATION
                            OF WHICH DEPENDS ON VISITOR'S INTERESTS AND SHAH'S MOOD. HE IS ALSO A
                            GOOD LISTENER AND IS USUALLY CANDID IN HIS <pb n="2" xml:id="d184-02" facs="d184-02"/>ANSWERS.</p>
                        <p>2. OUR LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH SHAH ARE GOOD ON BASIS OF PERIODIC
                            MEETINGS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MACARTHUR</persName>, FREQUENT MEETINGS WITH
                            COURT MINISTER ALAM WHO ALWAYS CAREFULLY REFLECTS SHAH'S VIEWS, AS WELL
                            AS SPECIAL AUDIENCES, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD INSIGHT INTO SHAH'S VIEWS
                            ON WORLD AROUND HIM AND ON SPECIFIC ISSUES OF MUTUAL INTEREST. PREVIOUS:
                            MESSAGE IN THIS SERIES (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) HAS
                            DEALT WITH US/IRANIAN RELATIONS AND OUR ESTIMATE OF SHAH'S VIEWS ON OUR
                            BILATERAL RELATIONS AS WELL AS HIS HOPE FOR US ROLE IN THIS AREA AGAINST
                            BACKGROUND OF SOVIET AMBITIONS AND THREAT TO IRAN AND TO FREE WORLD
                            INTERESTS IN MIDDLE EAST AND GULF. THIS MESSAGE FOCUSES ON SHAH'S
                            CURRENT THOUGHTS AND ASPIRATIONS FOR HIS COUNTRY AND VIEWS ON
                            DEVELOPMENTS IN MIDDLE EAST, MANY OF WHICH WERE MOST RECENTLY SPELLED
                            OUT IN SESSION APRIL 23 WITH NWC STUDENTS. THEY REPRESENT SHAH'S LATEST
                            THINKING ON WIDE VARIETY OF SUBJECTS AND INSIGHT TO HIS VIEWS ON SOME OF
                            TOPICS THAT MAY COME UP DURING HIS MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT.</p>
                        <p>3. FUTURE OF IRAN: THE SHAH USUALLY STRESSES REMARKABLE ECONOMIC
                            DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRY, WHICH INCREASINGLY COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH
                            GROWTH RATE OF JAPAN. HE ATTRIBUTES THIS SUCCESS STORY TO IRAN'S
                            RESOURCES—BOTH HUMAN, FOR THE IRANIAN PEOPLE ARE ENERGETIC AND ANXIOUS
                            TO LEARN FROM OTHERS, AND NATURAL RESOURCES WITH WHICH IRAN IS HAPPILY
                            WELL ENDOWED. BY END OF NEXT 5-YEAR PLAN STARTING 1973, HE HOPES TO
                            DOUBLE IRAN'S PER CAPITA INCOME AND BY 1985 BRING IRAN UP TO A PER
                            CAPITA INCOME OF $1,000 WHICH WOULD MAKE IT THE MOST PROSPEROUS COUNTRY
                            IN ASIA AFTER JAPAN AND PUT IT ON A PAR WITH SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
                            HE ALSO LOOKS FORWARD TO I00 PERCENT LITERACY BY 1985. HE RECOGNIZES
                            THAT IRAN'S POPULATION GROWTH RATE COMPLICATES MATTERS. HOWEVER, COUNTRY
                            IS NOW LAUNCHED ON FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM AND HE HOPES TO CUT BACK
                            POPULATION GROWTH FROM CURRENT 3.2 PERCENT TO 1 PERCENT. HE DOES NOT
                            BELIEVE ZERO POPULATION GROWTH RATE IS ADVISABLE BECAUSE POPULATION
                            WOULD GROW OLD AND LOSE ITS VITALITY. HE WOULD PREFER TO KEEP POPULATION
                            TO ABOUT 50 MILLIION LEVEL, BUT RECOGNIZES BEST IRAN CAN NOW HOPE FOR IS
                            LEVELLING OFF AT 65 MILLION IN ABOUT 20 YEARS. IN THIS CONNECTION HE
                            NOTES THAT TEHRAN IS REACHING 4 MILLION FIGURE AND DECENTRALIZATION <pb n="3" xml:id="d184-03" facs="d184-03"/>MUST TAKE PLACE BECAUSE
                            AVAILABLE WATER SUPPLIES CANNOT TAKE CARE OF MORE THAN 51/2 MILLION IN
                            TEHRAN AREA.</p>
                        <p>4. POLITICAL GROWTH. AS RESULT HIS GOVERNMENT'S EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION AND
                            EMPLOYMENT, SHAH EXPECTS LITERATE AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS TO EXPAND
                            RAPIDLY. HE DOES NOT AGREE HOWEVER WITH THOSE WHO ASSERT THIS WILL LEAD
                            TO ERA OF CONFRONTATION. RATHER, HIS GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES ARE INTENDED
                            TO SEE THAT COUNTRY WILL TAKE WHAT HE CALLS PATH OF PARTICIPATION. HE IS
                            WORKING FOR "DEMOCRATIC ECONOMY" IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE STAKE IN THEIR
                            FUTURE AS IN CASE OF THOSE WHO PROFITED FROM LAND REFORM, AND HE HOPES
                            VARIOUS POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS WILL PROVIDE OUTLETS
                            FOR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESSION. THESE UNITS INCLUDE
                            COOPERATIVES AND SOCIETIES AT THE VILLAGE LEVEL, VILLAGE COUNCIL EQUITY
                            COURTS, CITY AND PROVINCIAL COUNCILS AND FINALLLY PARILIAMENT. POLITICAL
                            PARTIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT PART OF PROCESS AND SHAH HAS ENCOURAGED THEIR
                            THEIR ESTABLISHMENT.</p>
                        <p>5. SECURITY OF IRAN. WHILE IRAN VALUES FRIENDS AND ALLIES, ONLY SAFE
                            POLICY IS FOR IRAN TO STAND ON ITS OWN FEET AND BE PREPARED TO DEFEND
                            ITSELF. IT IS BUILDING UP ITS ARMED FORCES AND AS ONE DETERRENT IS
                            MAKING CLEAR TO ALL ITS NEIGHBORS, WITH <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AS REAL TARGET, THAT ANY WHO HAVE AMBITIONS IN IRAN
                            WILL FIND A WASTED COUNTRY BECAUSE IRAN WILL PURSUE A SCORCHED EARTH
                            POLICY LEAVING NOTHING BEHIND FOR THE INVADER. IRAN AND US HAVE A TREATY
                            RELATIONSHIP, BUT THIS IS LOOSELY WORDED AND CANNOT BE RELIED UPON IN A
                            CRISIS. ON OTHER HAND, IRAN AND WHAT IT REPRESENTS IN GULF IS SO VITAL
                            TO WESTERN <pb n="4" xml:id="d184-04" facs="d184-04"/>INTERESTS THAT
                            LATTER CANNOT AFFORD TO SEE IRAN GO UNDER. THIS IS FACT OF LIFE WHICH
                            UNITED STATES AND WEST MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.</p>
                        <p>6. PAKISTAN-INDIA: SHAH DOES NOT THINK THAT RECENT CONFLICT IN
                            SUBCONTINENT DAMAGED HIS RELATIONS WITH INDIA WHICH REMAIN SATISFACTORY.
                            INDIANS KNEW SHAH DISAGREED 100 PERCENT WITH <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">YAHYA KHAN</persName>'S POLICIES VIS-A-VIS EAST
                            PAKISTAN. AT SAME TIME IRAN HAS NOT AS YET ACCEPTED BANGLA DESH, NOR
                            WILL IRAN RECOGNIZE IT IN VERY NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE IT HAD SEEN CREATED
                            BY AGGRESSION FROM OUTSIDE. UNITY AND INTEGRETY OF WEST PAKISTAN IS OF
                            VITAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES IF
                            PAKISTAN PROVINCENS, AND ESPECIALLY NORTHWESTERN FRONTIER AND
                            BALUCRISTAN PROVINCES, BROKE AWAY. HE DOES NOT THINK INDIA WANTS
                            BREAK-UP OF PAKISTAN NOR DOES HE THINK INDIA COULD OR WOULD OCCUPY IT.
                            BREAK-UP OF PAKISTAN COULD HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES TO
                            SECURITY OF IRAN BECAUSE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, SOVIETS WOULD SEEK TO
                            EXPLOIT RESULTING CONFUSION TO THEIR ADVANTAGE AND ATTEMPT TO USE
                            SITUATION TO ACHIEVE LAND BASE TO ARABIAN SEA. SOVIETS COULD WORK
                            THROUGH AFGHANISTAN, WHERE THEIR INFLUENCE IS <pb n="5" xml:id="d184-05" facs="d184-05"/>VAST, THROUGH INDIA AS A RESULT OF TREATY WHICH GAVE
                            SOVIETS FOOTHOLD IN SUBCONTINENT OR THROUGH LOCAL MOVEMENTS SUCH AS
                            BALUCHISTAN. SHAH IS CONCERNED ABOUT RECENT LITERATURE AND <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> APPEARING OUT OF BAGHDAD CALLING FOR
                            INDEPENDENT BALUCHYSTAN WITH A BORDER ON SOVIET UNION WHICH IN EFFECT
                            WOULD GIVE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ACCESS TO WARM WATER
                            PORT IN INDIAN OCEAN.</p>
                        <p>7. KING <persName>HUSSEIN</persName> AND THE FUTURE OF JORDAN. SHAH
                            ADMIRES AND RESPECTS HUSSEIN HIGHLY FOR HIS SKILL AND COURAGE.
                            VIABLILITY OF JORDAN AND SURVIVAL OF <persName>HUSSEIN</persName> ARE
                            CRUCIAL TO STABILITY OF AREA IS IMPORTANT THAT FRIENDS HELP
                                <persName>HUSSEIN</persName>, AND HE UNDERSTANDS
                                <persName>HUSSEIN</persName> RETURNED FROM US SATISFIED WITH <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> DECISIONS TO ASSIST JORDAN FURTHER
                            ECONOMICALLY AND MILITARILY. JORDAN NEEDS HELP, INCLUDING SUBSIDIES FROM
                            FRIENDLY ARAB COUNTRIES. SAUDI ARABIA IS CONTINUING HELP JORDAN AND THIS
                            IS GOOD. AS FOR KUWAITIS "IMPOSSIBLE PEOPLE" — EVERY TIME FLY GOES BY
                            THEY USE THAT AS EXCUSE TO TURN OFF THEIR SUBSIDIES TO JORDAN.
                                <persName>HUSSEIN</persName>'S PLAN FOR WEST BANK MAKES SENSE.
                            UNFORTUNATELY ARABS WILL NOT ACCEPT IT BECAUSE OF ITS SPONSORSHIP. HE
                            UNDERSTANDS THERE ARE EGYPTIANS AND OTHERS WHO WELCOME PLAN BUT HAVE TO
                            OPPOSE IT PUBLICLY BECAUSE IT PUT FORWARD BY
                                <persName>HUSSEIN</persName>.</p>
                        <p>WERE <persName>HUSSEIN</persName> TO LOSE POWER RESULTS COULD BE
                            DISASTROUS. PALESTINIANS WHO SEEK TO TAKE OVER HAVE NO REAL GOVERNMENT
                            AND THEIR PROPOSAL FOR THE JOINT ARAB/JEWISH STATE IS RIDICULOUS. IF
                            JORDAN WENT, KUWAIT COULD GO IN A MATTER OF DAYS, AND HOW LONG WOULD IT
                            BE BEFORE SAUDI ARABIA SUFFERED SAME FATE? GULF COULD THEN BE IN CHAOS
                            WITH WESTERN INTERESTS SERIOUSLY THREATENED.</p>
                        <p>8. VALUE OF SUEZ CANAL TO IRAN. SHAH FEELS SUEZ CANAL IS NO LONGER OF
                            COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE TO IRAN. ITS COMMERCE WITH EUROPE NOW GOES
                            OVERLAND THROUGHTURKE OR SOVIET UNION AND THIS IS A FASTER ROUTE THAN
                            THROUGH SUEZ. THE CLOSURE OF SUEZ IS OF COURSE OF SOME MILITARY VALUE BY
                            COMPLICATING SOVIET DEPLOYMENT OF FORCES IN INDIAN OCEAN.</p>
                        <p>9. ISRAEL. IN PAST SHAH HAS LOOKED UPON ISRAEL AS BALANCING FACTOR IN
                            IRAN'S RELATIONS WITH ARAB WORLD <pb n="6" xml:id="d184-06" facs="d184-06"/>AND AS USEFUL COUNTER TO RADICAL ARAB DESIGNS ON
                            GULF. WHILE THIS ELEMENT STILL REMAINS IN HIS THINKING AND IRAN
                            CONTINUES HAVE QUIET AND CLOSE RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL, HE IS ALSO
                            CONCERNED. THAT "NO PEACE - NO WAR" SITUATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ARABS
                            IS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR SOVIETS TO GAIN PERMANENT FOOTHOLD IN
                            EASTERN MEDITTERRANEAN AND COULD BE USED FOR SIMILAR PURPOSES IN
                            COUNTRIES CLOSER TO IRAN. HENCE HE STRESSES IRAN'S SUPPORT FOR SECURITY
                            COUNCIL RES 242 AND ESPECIALLY FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM SEIZED ARAB
                            TERRITORIES.</p>
                        <p>10. SOVIET-IRAQ TREATY. LANGUAGE OF TREATY IS AMBIGUOUS AND COULD BE
                            INTERPRETED VARIOUS WAYS. ACCORDING TO ONE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 8
                            IN PARTICULAR, TREATY COULD BE REGARDED AS HOSTILE TO IRAN. SOVIET UNION
                            IS CAREFUL IN ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN, AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DOES NOT FEEL IT SHOULD REACT TO TREATY UNLESS SPECIFIC
                            DEVELOPMENTS ARISE OUT OF THE TREATY WHICH GIVE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.
                            HOWEVER, SHOULD SOVIETS BE SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING KURDS, IRAQI
                            COMMUNISTS AND BA'ATHIST PARTY TOGETHER IN NATIONAL FRONT THIS WOULD BE
                            A VERY SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT FOR IRAN.</p>
                        <p>11. THE GULF. SHAH STRESSES DEPENDENCE OF JAPAN AND WEST ON GULF, WHICH
                            HAS LARGEST PROVEN PETROLEUM RESERVES IN WORLD. SOME 17 MILLION BARRELS
                            OF OIL DAILY GO THROUGH STRAITS OF HORMOZ TO JAPAN AND TO WEST. SOME 10
                            YEARS FROM NOW THERE WILL BE ENERGY CRISIS IN US. IN PAST VENEZUELA AND
                            US HAVE MET SOME OIL SHORTAGES OF WEST. THIS WILL NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE.
                            GULF IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY VITAL TO SECURITY OF FREE WORLD AND IF THE
                            FLOW IF THE FLOW OF OIL WAS INTERRUPTED OR IF OIL CAME UNDER CONTROL OF
                            UNFRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS PREPARED TO USE OIL AS POLITICAL INSTRUMENT, FREE
                            WORLD WOULD BE IN SERIOUS SITUATION AND ECONOMIES OF COUNTRIES LIKE
                            JAPAN COULD BE FORCED TO COMPLETE HALT. IT THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT US
                            AND FREE WORLD TOOK CAREFUL LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN GULF AND ABOUT
                            THREATS TO ITS STABILITY.</p>
                        <p>12. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: SHAH TRACES <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S RELATIONS WITH UAE TO LONG NEGOTIATIONS WITH BRITISH OVER
                            ISLANDS AND REASONS WHY HE FELT IRAN SHOULD OCCUPY THEM. HE STRESSES
                            THAT WE HAS SET ASIDE THE QUESTION OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER <pb n="7" xml:id="d184-07" facs="d184-07"/>ABU MUSA WATERS. SHEIKH ZAYID OF
                            ABU AHABI IS PROBLEM. HE WENT OFF TO LIBYA AND OTHER CONTRIES AND
                            COMMITTED HIMSELF TO RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS ABOUT IRAN. HE IS SURROUNDED
                            BY ADVISERS, ESPECIALLY SUWEIDI, WHO ARE OF QUESTIONABLE ABILITY AND
                            SYMPATHIES. THIS IS A SITUATION WHICH HAS TO BE WATCHED CLOSELY. IRAN
                            HAS ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH UAE, BUT SHAH IS DISTURBED OVER TREND OF
                            DEVELOPMENTS THERE AND DOES NOT BELIEVE EVEN STABLE UAE (WHICH FAR FROM
                            CERTAIN) WILL ADD ANY STRENGTH IN GULF AREA.</p>
                        <p>13. INDIAN OCEAN. SECURITY OF IRAN AND ITS OIL LIFELINE TO WEST THROUGH
                            STRAITS OF HORMOZ REQUIRE THAT NAVY BE STRENGTHENED, IN FIRST INSTANCE
                            TO SECURE IRANIAN INTERESTS IN GULF AND THEN FROM, GULF INTO ARABIAN
                            SEA, AND ON INTO INDIAN OCEAN, SHAH SEEMS UNCERTAIN STILL HOW FAR IRAN'S
                            RESPONSIBLILITIES IN INDIA OCEAN WOULD GO BUT IS CONVINCED IRAN HAS
                            RESPONSIBILITIES IN INDIAN OCEAN AS WELL AS GULF FROM NOW ON.</p>
                        <p>14. CHINESE COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN AREA. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS
                            IMPORTANCE OF CHINA IN MlDDLE EAST. IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY FACTOR IN
                            STRATEGIC BALANCE, BUT WHAT ROLE IT MAY PLAY NOT YET CLEAR. IT IS TRUE
                            THAT CHINA IS SUPPORTING THE PDRY INSURGENCY AGAINST OMAN BUT SO WERE
                            RUSSIANS AND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME COMPETITION AMONG THEM. IRAN'S
                            PRINCIPAL INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH PEKING IS TO PROVIDE
                            DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL COUNTERWEIGHT OT POTENTIAL/LIKELY PRESSURES ON
                            IRAN FROM SOVIET UNION IN FUTURE.</p>
                        <p>15. UNITED NATIONS. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> IS BECOMING
                            INCREASINGLY <pb n="8" xml:id="d184-08" facs="d184-08"/>IMPOTENT AS
                            DEMONSTRATED BY ITS PERFORMANCE DURING INDO-PAK CONFLICT AND MORE
                            RECENTLY LACK OF ANY INTEREST OTHER THAN THAT GENERATED BY IRAN IN
                            EXPULSION OF SOME 60,000 IRANIANS FROM IRAQ. NO ONE EXPRESSED CONCERN OR
                            TOOK INTEREST IN THE MATTER. APPEARANCE OF CHINESE AT <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> CHANGE THINGS, BUT SHAH FEELS IN FUTURE
                            MORE NATURAL DEVELOPMENT WILL BE GROUPING OF COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR
                            INTERESTS AND OBJECTIVES WORKING TOGETHER IN THEIR COMMON INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>16. F-4'S AND F-5'S. F-5 IS USEFUL AIRCRAFT WHICH HAS MORE OR LESS
                            OUTLIVED ITS PURPOSE. F-4, AND ESPECIALLY F-4E IS EXCELLENT PLANE OUT IT
                            IS NOT A MATCH FOR MIG-23. THE LATTER CAN CLIMB TO 80,000 FEET ANDFIRE A
                            MISSILE AT ANY PLANE BELOW THAT WITH NO NEED FOR COMBAT AT LOWER
                            ALTITUDES WHERE F-4 MIGHT HAVE ADVANTAGES. BECAUSE OF PRESENCE OF MIG-23
                            IN AREA AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF SU-11, IRAN MUST SHORTLY MOVE TO NEXT
                            GENERATION OF AIRCRAFT. SHAH WOULD PREFER TO BUY FROM UNITED STATES, BUT
                            IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM HE WILL TURN TO FRENCH AIRCRAFT OR CONSIDER NEW
                            PLANE BEING DEVELOPED BY BRITISH-GERMAN COMBINATION.</p>
                        <p>17. NUCLEAR POLICY. SHAH IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR
                            WEAPONS IN IRAN. HE SEES NO PURPOSE TO DIVERSION OF FUNDS FOR THIS
                            PURPOSE BECAUSE AT BEST IRAN WOULD BE A SMALL NUCLEAR POWER FACING ONE

                        </list>
                        <p>1. I believe that it may be helpful for the President to be informed of
                            certain unique characteristics of the apparatus used by the Shah of Iran
                            in conducting Iron's foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>2. During the past decade, and particularly during the past five years,
                            the Shah has sought to provide for the security of Iran through the
                            rapid development of that country as a modern industrial state with a
                            rapidly expanding military establishment. He likes to describe Iran as
                            the only strong, stable and important nation between Japan and the
                            European Community. Although Iran officially participates in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                            and the RCD and pays at least lip service to King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName>'s concept of "Islamic
                            Solidarity,” the Shah is reluctant to place confidence in regionalism or
                            any collective security arrangement with his conservative neighbors.
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d185-02" facs="d185-02"/>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>4. Since the death of President Masser, the Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> have viewed Egypt not as the
                            arch enemy but as a potential defector from the Soviet camp in the Arab
                            world. Both the Shah and <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName>
                            have good relations with President Sadat who has gradually been drawn
                            into a closer relationship with Saudi Arabia and, partly through Saudi
                            Arabia, with Iran. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Both
                            remain convinced, however, that they should support his efforts to reach
                            a settlement and reduce the Soviet influence in Egypt.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d185-03" facs="d185-03"/>
                        <p>5. I recommend that the President include the following points in his
                            discussions with the Shah:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> obviously has the Gulf and
                            the Arabian Peninsula high on the agenda for its continuing effort to
                            expand its influence in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>b. The best response to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> threat
                            is a coordinated regional effort. The Shah, with his special association
                            with Israel and Turkey in the north and with King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> and King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in the Arab bloc, has a unique
                            capability to exercise leadership in the region.</p>
                        <p>c. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>d. Given the circumstances in the Middle East, the Shah is acting wisely
                            in using secret diplomacy [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            in developing coordinated programs with his neighbors.</p>
                        <p>e. President Sadat probably represents the best leadership we can expect
                            in Egypt. Regionalism independent of Great Power domination offers Sadat
                            the best alternative to his present dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> should attempt to quietly
                            involve Sadat in matters which can move Egypt toward a role in an
                            independent Middle East region.</p>

                        <p>1. AS GENERAL PROPOSITION AND AGAINST BACKGROUND OF SHAH'S CONCERNS OVER
                            MAJOR SOVIET GAINS IN MIDDLE EAST AREA AND STEPPED-UP SOVIET EFFORTS TO
                            REDUCE AMERICAN INFLUENCE AND PRESENCE IN THIS AREA, AND ESPECIALLY
                            GULF— AS DESCRIBED IN PREVIOUS MESSAGES IN THIS SERIES—WE ANTICIPATE
                            SHAH'S PRIMARY AND OVERALL INTEREST WILL BE TO ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'S ASSESSMENT OF SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN
                            MIDDLE EAST AND EXTENT OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'S
                            INTEREST, WILL AND DETERMINATION TO REMAIN IN 'THIS PART OF THE
                            WORLD.</p>
                        <p>2. TO THIS END SHAH WILL BE INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM PRESIDENT
                            HIGHLIGHTS AND PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS OF HIS MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS IN
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> INCLUDING PROSPECTS FOR
                            DETENTE IN EUROPE RESULTING FROM POSSIBLE AGREEMENTS IN SALT TALKS,
                            EAST/WEST SECURITY CONFERENCE, ETC. THIS IS ON SHAH'S MIND BECAUSE,
                            WHILE HE OF COURSE FAVORS DETENTE, HE IS CONCERNED THAT DETENTE IN
                            EUROPE WILL RELEASE SOVIET ENERGIES AND STRENGTH TO STEP UP SOVIET
                            CAMPAIGN TO <pb n="2" xml:id="d187-02" facs="d187-02"/>PENETRATE MIDDLE
                            EAST AND EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE HERE. SHAH WILL ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO
                            ASSESSMENT FROM PRESIDENT ON HOW US VIEWS SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN MIDDLE
                            EAST AIMED AT SECURING DOMINANT POSITION IN GULF AND INDIAN OCEAN AREA.
                            HE UNDOUBTEDLY HOPES US IS PREPARED PUBLICLY AS WELL, AS PRIVATELY TO
                            TAKE FIRM POSITION WITH SOVIETS THAT US WILL STAND FIRM AGAINST SOVIET
                            EFFORT EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE IN MIDDLE EAST, PERSIAN GULF AND INDIAN
                            OCEAN AREA, AND HE WILL PROBABLY TELL PRESIDENT THAT IF WE ARE STEADFAST
                            IN MIDDLE-EAST <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CAN COUNT ON IRAN TO
                            COOPERATE FULLY WITH US.</p>
                        <p>3. AS IRAN IS PAYING ITS OWN WAY TO MEET ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
                            MILITARY NEEDS, SHAH WILL LIKELY POINT OUT THAT IRAN-US COOPERATION WILL
                            NOT PLACE ANY DEMANDS ON <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> RESOURCES.
                            HE HOPES COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE ALONG LINES ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED,
                            WITH US CONTINUING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SHAH'S REQUEST FOR INFORMATION,
                            TECHNOLOGY AND MODERN EQUIPMENT THAT HE FEELS IRAN NEEDS AND IS PREPARED
                            TO PAY FOR SPECIFICALLY HE WILL LOOK TO US TO CONTINUE TO:</p>
                        <p>(A) MAKE AVAILABLE AND SELL MODERN MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS IRAN
                            NEEDS:</p>
                        <p>(B) MAKE CREDIT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE OF US EQUIPMENT TO MAXIMUM EXTENT
                            POSSIBLE WHICH IRAN WILL REPAY ON SCHEDULE:</p>
                        <p>(C) CONTINUE TO TRAIN IRAN'S PILOTS (AT IRAN'S EXPSENSE) FOR NEXT SEVERAL
                            YEARS:</p>
                        <p>(D) PROVIDE EXPERIENCED TECHNICAL AND MILITARY PERSONNEL ON <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> STAFF TO CONTINUE TO
                            HELP TRAIN AND ORGANIZE IRAN'S RESOURCES:</p>
                        <p>(E) MAKE AVAILABLE AT LEAST THREE SQUADRONS OF F-15'S (WITH POSSIBLY TWO
                            TO FOUR F-14'S EQUIPPED WITH PHOENIX MISSLE PER SQUADRON) WHENEVER F-15
                            HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY TESTED AND REACHES PRODUCTION LINE. SHAH CAN BE
                            EXPECTED TO PRESS HARD ON F-15 MATTER WHICH CURRENTLY IS MOST IMPORTANT
                            AND HIGHEST PRIORITY MILITARY ACQUISITION ITEM FROM HIS VIEW. HE
                            UNDERSTANDS WE CANNOT PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY <pb n="3" xml:id="d187-03" facs="d187-03"/>ABOUT THIS WEAPONS SYSTEM OR MAKE COMMITMENTS ABOUT
                            COSTS, DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ETC., BUT HE WILL SEEK FROM PRESIDENT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> COMMITMENT TO MAKE THIS AIRCRAFT
                            AVAILABLE TO IRAN AS SOON AS <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> NEEDS
                            ARE MET AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES CAN GET THEIR SHARE OF PRODUCTION LINE.
                            DURING THIS DISCUSSION SHAH MAY MAKE POINT THAT AS MOST RELIABLE AND
                            DEPENDABLE FRIEND OF US IN THIS PART OF ASIA IRAN IS ENTITLED TO SAME
                            MEASURE <pb n="4" xml:id="d187-04" facs="d187-04"/>OF MILITARY
                            COOPERATION IN WEAPONS SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTION AS OUR <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ALLIES.</p>
                        <p>4. SHAH CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED TO DISCUSS SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN GULF AND
                            THREAT TO GULF PEACE AND STABILITY FROM SUBVERSIVE ELEMENTS CAPITALIZING
                            ON WEAKNESS AND FRAGILE POLITICAL STATUS OF STATES ON SOUTHERN SIDE OF
                            GULF. HE WILL EXPLAIN PLANS HE HAS TO STRENGTHEN IRAN'S FORCES AND
                            GRADUALLY BUILD UP NAVY AND RECONNAISSANCE RESOURCES TO PLAY ROLE FIRST
                            IN GULF AND THEN GRADUALLY MOVING OUT INTO ARABIAN SEA AND INDIAN OCEAN.
                            IN THIS CONNECTION HE WILL BE INTERESTED IN OUR PLANS FOR MIDEASTFOR
                            (TEHRAN 2576) AND HE WILL OUTLINE TO PRESIDENT HIS PLANS FOR MAJOR NAVAL
                            AND AIR FACILITY AT CHAH BAHAR WHICH US TEAM CURRENTLY STUDYING.</p>
                        <p>5. AS MANY OF SHAH'S JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS REGARDING MILITARY
                            ACQUISITIONS AND BUILDUP OF IRAN'S FORCES ARE INFLUENCED BY INTELLIGENCE
                            REPORTS HE HAS ABOUT SOVIET ACITIVITIES IN AREA AND DELIVERY OF MILITARY
                            EQUIPMENT TO RADICAL ARAB STATES, WE RECOMMEND PRESIDENT HAVE OUR LATEST
                            ASSESSMENTS ON:</p>
                        <p>(A) REPORTED SOVIET/IRAQ SECRET AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE SOVIETS WITH NAVAL
                            BASE AT UMM AL-QASR IN GULF:</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d187-05" facs="d187-05"/>
                        <p>(B) REPORTS THAT SOVIETS ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO RADICAL ARAB
                            STATES, INCLUDING IRAQ, MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS INCLUDING MIG-23'S
                            AND SA-3 MISSIELS:</p>
                        <p>(C) COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS OF MIG-23'S ESPECIALLY AGAINST F-4's. FYI BASIS
                            OF SHAH'S CURRENT INTEREST IN F-15 IS HIS CONVICTION THAT F-4'S ARE NO
                            MATCH FOR MIG-23'S WHICH SOVIETS ARE INTRODUCING INTO AREA AND WHICH
                            THEREFORE MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR IRAN TO ACQUIRE NEXT GENERATION
                            AIRCRAFT THAT CAN MATCH MIG-23 PERFORMANCE.</p>
                        <p>6. PRESIDENT'S VISIT WILL TAKE PLACE SHORTLY AFTER THIRD ROUND OF
                            CONFIDENTIAL TALKS SHAH IS HAVING WITH CONSORTIUM LEADING TO NEW
                            LONG-RANGE ARRANGEMENTS ON PARTICIPATION. SINCE NEXT MEETING SCHEDULED
                            MAY 17 IT NOT NOW POSSIBLE BE CERTAIN WHAT STATUS MAY BE WHEN PRESIDENT
                            AND SHAH MEET. HOWEVER, IF PRESENT SITUATION PERSISTS, NEGOTATIONS WILL
                            CONSIST OF CONTINUING HARD BARGAINING ON CERTAIN SPECIFIC ISSUES (SUCH
                            AS CONSORTIUM SUPPLY OIL AT PREMIUM PRICE TO NIOC FOR MARKETING ANYWHERE
                            IN WORLD) CONDUCTED IN ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDLY CONSTRUCTIVE EXCHANGE
                            BETWEEN TWO PARTIES WHOSE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING IS GOOD AND WHOSE
                            RELATIONS ARE BASICALLY ON FIRM FOUNDATION. PRESIDENT MAY WISH EMPHASIZE
                            TO SHAH <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CONTINUING STRONG INTEREST
                            IN ACHIEVING SETTLEMENT THIS ISSUE WHICH WILL PRESERVE FRAMEWORK OF
                            TEHRAN AGREEMENT AND PROVIDE FOR STEADY AND SECURE SUPPLY OF OIL TO
                            AMERICAN ALLIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA.</p>
                        <p>7. SHAH WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RAISE HARDY PERENNIAL QUESTION OF INCREASED
                            OIL EXPORTS FROM IRAN TO US. SHAH, WHOSE ADVISERS ARE KEEN OBSERVERS OF
                            CURRENT US CONTROVERSY ON OIL IMPORT QUOTA PROGRAM, WILL PRESS EITHER
                            FOR NEW SYSTEM ALLOWING MUCH LARGER IMPORTS TO US FROM IRAN OR FOR
                            EXCEPTION OR WAIVER UNDER PRESENT SYSTEM. HE WILL SUPPORT REQUEST WITH
                            LONGSTANDING ARGUMENT THAT EXTENSIVE IRANIAN ARMS PURCHASES IN US
                            JUSTIFY SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR IRANIAN OIL EXPORTS PARTICULARLY SINCE
                            SHAH AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WILL PLEDGE SPEND
                            ALL-PROFITS FROM SUCH EXPORTS WITHIN US. SHAH VERY LIKELY MAKE SAME
                            COMMENTS ON BASIS HIS FIRM UNDERSTANDING THAT US ITSELF WILL HAVE TO
                            START LOOKING TO MIDDLE EAST (INCLUDING GULF) AS SOURCE OF OIL IMPORTS
                            WITHIN NEAR <pb n="6" xml:id="d187-06" facs="d187-06"/>FUTURE.
                            PARTICULAR CAUTION IS NECESSARY ON THIS SUBJECT SINCE, AS DEPARTMENT
                            WILL RECALL, PRESIDENT'S EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN IRAN'S POSITION ON
                            THIS ISSUE WAS MISREAD BY SHAH IN LAST CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT AS
                            AMOUNTING TO COMMITMENT TO GRANT EXCEPTION TO QUOTA MAKING SUCH EXPORTS
                            POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>8. NARCOTICS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SHAH WILL RAISE SUBJECT OF NARCOTICS.
                            HOWEVER. GIVEN OUR CURRENT CONCERNS ON THIS SUBJECT WE BELIEVE IT WOULD
                            BE APPROPRIATE AND USEFUL FOR PRESIDENT TO (A) POINT OUT IDENTITY OF US
                            AND IRANIAN POSITIONS AS VICTIM COUNTRIES, WITH NEITHER CONTRIBUTING TO
                            ILLICIT INTERNATIONAL MARKET AND BOTH STRUGGLING TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT
                            AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. (FYI IRAN'S ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE AMONG
                            MOST EFFECTIVE IN WORLD. END FYI.), AND (B) EXPRESS HOPE THAT IRAN WILL
                            CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US REGIONALLY AND IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS TO BRING
                            NARCOTICS PRODUCTION UNDER CONTROL AND IN MEANTIME STEP UP ENFORCEMENT
                            MEASURES AGAINST ILLICIT TRAFFIC.</p>

                        <p>2. IN ADDITION TO POSITIONS PRESIDENT WILL TAKE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES, WE
                            BELIEVE PRESIDENT'S POSTURE IN IRAN —BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN
                            PRIVATE—SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXPLICITLY
                            STRESS THREE PRINCIPAL THEMES OUTLINED BELOW WHICH, IN OUR VIEW, SUM UP
                            IMPORTANCE OF IRAN TO US.</p>
                        <p>A. IRAN IS SUCCESS STORY AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FROM 1947 UNTIL

                        <p>(3) THIS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPLEMENTED TWO FACTS: (A) LARGE
                            SEGMENTS OF IRANIAN LEADERSHIP (BOTH IN AND OUT OF ESTABLISHMENT) HAVE
                            BEEN TRAINED OR EDUCATED IN US: AND (B) US STILL REMAINS CHOICE OF
                            LARGEST NUMBER OF IRANIAN STUDENTS WHO GO ABROAD FOR STUDY.</p>
                        <p>(4) THE CURRENT BASES OF IRAN-US FRIENDSHIP ARE STRONG, THERE ARE NO
                            SERIOUS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN US, OUR INTERESTS AND GOALS IN
                            REGION ARE CONGENIAL, AND IRAN LOOKS UPON US AS ITS BEST AND MOST
                            TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND. BENEFITS OF IRAN-US FRIENDSHIP HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN
                            TANGIBLE AND SUBSTANTIAL: (A) IRAN PROVIDES US WITH IRREPLACEABLE
                            INTELLIGENCE FACILITIES VITAL TO US SECURITY INTERESTS; (B) IRAN ALSO
                            PROVIDES US (AND WEST) WITH ONLY SECURE AIR CORRIDOR BETWEEN EUROPEAN
                            NATO AND SOUTHEAST ASIA: (C) IN ECONOMIC SPHERE, IRAN IS PLAYING
                            MODERATING ROLE IN VITAL OIL MATTERS, CONTRIBUTES DIRECTLY TO US BALANCE
                            OF PAYMENTS, AND PROVIDES STABLE AND FRIENDLY CLIMATE FOR US INVESTMENT:
                            (D) IN DIPLOMATIC SPHERE IRAN HAS BEEN WILLING SERVE AS CHANNEL OF
                            COMMUNICATION FOR US IDEAS AND, ADVICE (E.G. ON ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE AND

                        <p>C. IRAN IS RESPONSIBLE AND MODERATE REGIONAL POWER IN AREA OF VITAL
                            IMPORTANCE TO US AND WEST.</p>
                        <p>(1) IRAN IS ONLY COUNTRY IN REGION WITH BOTH WILL AND ABILITY TO PLAY
                            ROLE OF LEADERSHIP IN PROTECTING SECURITY OF PERSIAN GULF —AREA WHICH IS
                            NOW OF VITAL IMPORTANCE AS SOURCE OF OIL TO US ALLIES IN PACIFIC AND

                        </list>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Peter Flanigan</persName> in the attached
                            memorandum reports on the current state of negotiations between the oil
                            consortium and the Iranian Oil Company. These negotiations are being led
                            on the Company side by KEN JAMIESON, Chairman of Standard Oil of New
                            Jersey.</p>
                        <p>The request that comes through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> is that the Shah, during your discussions in
                            Tehran, not be encouraged in his desire for access to the US market for
                            Iranian oil. His point is that such access would make our relations with
                            other Persian Gulf countries as well as with Venezuela extraordinarily
                            difficult and would make impossible the already difficult task of
                            managing the mandatory oil import program.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly true that granting special terms of access for one
                            country like Iran to the US market would, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> says, make it very difficult
                            to administer the whole oil import program and would create problems
                            with other Persian Gulf suppliers. It is also possibly true that the
                            Shah will put less emphasis on access to the US market because Iran will
                            probably have little difficulty in marketing its oil elsewhere in view
                            of expanding world needs. Whereas this was a major item on his mind when
                            he visited here in 1969, the world market has changed sufficiently that
                            he may feel less strongly about it now.</p>
                        <p>The one general issue that this raises in my mind, however, is that of
                            the criteria we should use for deciding from which countries we import
                            oil and other energy products as our needs for imported energy increase
                            over the next decade. It would be possible, for instance, to <pb n="2" xml:id="d189-02" facs="d189-02"/>establish criteria which would make
                            it possible to select friendly countries and to import from them rather
                            than from less friendly ones. At present there is the possibility that
                            we could import energy products from a wide variety of sources, but very
                            little work has been done on the merits of these different alternatives
                            taking into account security of source, political issues, costs, etc. I
                            believe this should be more thoroughly examined than it has been.</p>
                        <p>In the short term, however, I agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> that the line for you to take with the Shah is
                            essentially not one of encouraging him to expect immediate access to the
                            U.S. market but to discuss in general the problems you have in this
                            field and to promise to work with the Iranians on it. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> has mentioned to me the
                            importance he attaches to your expressing your appreciation to the Shah
                            for the key role Iran has played in the interest of stability of energy
                            relationships in the Free World and the hope that Iran will continue to
                            play a moderate role.</p>

                            <item>Mr. Kermit Roosevelt's 26 April Meeting with the Shah of
                                Iran</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. During the last week of April 1972, Mr. Kermit Roosevelt was in
                            Teheran dealing with the Iranian Government on behalf of one of his
                            American business associates. Just prior to his departure from Teheran,
                            Mr. Roosevelt met with the Shah, with whom he has had a close personal
                            relationship dating back more than twenty years. [<hi rend="italic">text
                                not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. Roosevelt said the Shah was obviously preoccupied with the
                            prospect of an opportunity to discuss world problems with the President.
                            In this context the Shah indulged in a lengthy discourse on the
                            situation in the region. The following summarizes the principal points
                            made by the Shah:</p>
                        <p>a. Major economic blocs are emerging. Logically the Middle East region
                            should itself organize to deal more effectively with the principal world
                            power blocs. The Shah sees the need for regional <pb n="2" xml:id="d190-02" facs="d190-02"/>development in the Middle East and
                            believes that he probably has as good credentials as anyone for
                            asserting some leadership in the region. The principal objective of the
                            region must be to remain free and independent.</p>
                        <p>b, The Shah is disturbed by events in the subcontinent which have created
                            the possibility that West Pakistan may fragment. He is worried about
                            Soviet capabilities in Afghanistan. The Shah says that he understands
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s problems and is more
                            optimistic about <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s
                            character and abilities than he has been in the past. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> will come to see the Shah after
                            the President's visit.</p>
                        <p>c. The Shah said that he was very concerned about Turkey, He dwelled on
                            this subject at length. He feels that Turkey does not know where, in
                            terms of its role in world affairs, it is going.</p>
                        <p>d. The Shah said that he had always been hopeful that he could work
                            closely and effectively with King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName>. He realized that his own actions on the Gulf
                            islands had damaged the relationship and embarrassed King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName>. He hopes that the action on
                            the Gulf can be relegated to history and not permanently restrict the
                            cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia which the Shah feels is
                            essential for regional security. The Shah hopes to soon take the
                            initiative in strengthening his relations with Saudi Arabia.</p>

                        <p>f. The Shah found the recent Iraq pact with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> "most disturbing…a fulfillment of his worst dreams.”
                            He sees the Soviet action in Iraq as relevant to Soviet aspirations in
                            the Gulf. In this connection, he described as "dismal folly" the action
                            by SHEIKH ZAYID of Abu Dhabi in agreeing to the establishment of a
                            Soviet Embassy in the New Union of Arab Emirates.</p>

                        <p>g. The Shah has been disappointed by the action of President Sadat of
                            Egypt in the past few months. The Shah has been impressed by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>'s performance since
                            taking office and had hoped that he would bring Egypt into closer
                            alignment with Iran. Saudi Arabia and other nations in the Middle East
                            who were determined to oppose the spread of Soviet influence. The Shah
                            will keep an open mind on this question until <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>'s position in Egypt and the
                            trend of his relations with Moscow are clearer. He was disappointed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> had acted so
                            abruptly in breaking relations with Jordan after King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> announced his new plan for
                            Palestine.</p>
                        <p>h. The Shah said that, in spite of the difficulties involved, he felt he
                            must play a more active role as a regional leader in organizing
                            anti-communist forces.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. Roosevelt said that other well-informed senior Iranians with whom
                            he met have expressed concern that the Shah has pressing domestic
                            problem that are not being given enough attention. They questioned
                            whether the Shah will be able to find the time to play the role of a
                            regional leader. Ambassador Nahmud Foruqi, former Iranian Ambassador in
                            Washington, D.C. and back in Iran after six years as Ambassador in
                            Kabul, told Roosevelt that he thought there was a growing gap between
                            "the government" and the people of Iran. He said that only the Shah's
                            personal influence holds "the government" and the people of Iran
                            together. He found inflation a serious problem and believed the
                            credibility of the government was badly eroded.</p>

                        <p> 1. REF (A) ASKED FOR OUR COMMENTS ON:</p>
                        <p>(A) WHETHER PRESIDENT SHOULD DISCUSS NARCOTICS PROBLEM PRIVATELY WITH
                            SHAH AND RAISE QUESTION OF REGIONAL COOPERATTON INCLUDING POSSIBLE
                            "OPIUM FREE ZONE" AND</p>
                        <p>(B) WHAT, IF ANYTHING, SHOULD BE SAID PUBLICLY AND HOW TO USE.</p>
                        <p>2. REGARDING SECOND POINT OF PUBLIC REFERENCE TO NARCOTICS BY PRESIDENT,
                            AS PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE IN TEHRAN IS NOW DEVELOPING THERE WILL BE ONLY
                            TWO OCCASIONS WHEN PRESIDENT WILL BE MAKING STATEMENT THAT COULD BECOME
                            PUBLIC. FIRST IS IN RESPONSE TO SHAH'S TOAST AT STATE DINNER MAY 30 AND
                            SECOND AT TOAST BY PRESIDENT TO SHAH AT LUNCHEON MAY 31. NEITHER OF
                            THESE OCCASIONS SEEMS TO US APPROPRIATE FOR MENTION OF NARCOTICS
                            PROBLEM. ONLY OTHER POSSIBILITY IS FOR REFERENCE TO NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN
                            ANY COMMUNIQUE THAY MAY BE ISSUED. PENDING INSTRUCTIONS FROM WASHINGTON
                            ON PLANS FOR COMMUNIQUE TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, WE HAVE
                            NOT RAISED MATTER WITH <pb n="2" xml:id="d191-02" facs="d191-02"/>IRANIANS. HOWEVER, WE SURMISE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            WOULD WELCOME COMMUNIQUE AS FURTHER TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF BENEFITS OF
                            PRESIDENT'S VISIT HERE AND ALSO BECAUSE COMMUNIQUE IS CUSTOMARY ON
                            OCCASION OF CHIEF OF STATE VISIT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOMMEND THERE BE
                            COMMUNIQUE AND, IF THIS IS ACCEPTABLE, APPROPRIATE REFERENCE TO
                            NARCOTICS PROBLEM BE INCLUDED IN DRAFT TEXT WE PUT TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. IF COMMUNIQUE DOES NOT EMERGE FROM
                            PRSIDENTIAL VISIT, WE DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER SUITABLE PUBLIC FORUM TO DEAL
                            WITH THIS SUBJECT.</p>
                        <p>3. REQUEST DEPARTMENTS VIEWS ON COMMUNIQUE AND, IF THESE ARE AFFIRMATIVE,
                            DRAFT OF TEXT INCLUDING LANGUAGE ON NARCOTICS PROBLEM WHICH WE SHOULD
                            RECOMMEND To GOT.</p>
                        <p>4. AS FOR SUBSTANCE OF REMARKS WHICH PRESIDENT MIGHT RAISE WITH SHAH ON
                            NARCOTICS PROBLEM, WE RECOMMEND THAT DEPARTURE POINT FOR PRESIDENT WOULD
                            BE TO STRESS SIMILARITY OF INTERESTS AND CONCERNS ON THIS MATTER BETWEEN
                            IRAN AND US:</p>
                        <p>(A) BOTH ARE VICTIM COUNTRIES OF NARCOTICS TRAFFIC.</p>
                        <p>(B) BOTH ARE TAKING STRINGENT ACTION TO CONTROL ILLICIT TRAFFIC AND,
                            FURTHER, IRAN HAS DEVELOPED EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CONTROL
                            PRODUCTION WITHIN IRAN AND HAS SUCCESSFUL ENFORCEMENT RECORD. LIKE US,
                            PROBLEM IRAN FACES IS ILLICIT IMPORTS FROM NEIGHBORS TO MEET INTERNAL
                            DEMANDS AND EVENTUALLY THIS TRAFFIC MAY MOVE ACROSS IRAN TO OTHER
                            MARKETS TO THE WEST.</p>
                        <p>(C) BOTH ARE INVESTING TIME AND MONEY IN FINDING WAYS TO TREAT ADDICTION
                            AND TO DISCOVER NEW ANTI-ADDITCTION ANTAGONISTS. IC) BOTH ARE ACTIVE IN
                            INTERNATIONAL FORUMS DEALING WITH NARCOTICS PROBLEM OFTEN COOPERATING
                            CLOSELY ON INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES.</p>
                        <p>5. HAVING MADE THESE POINTS, PRESIDENT COULD THEN GO ON TO EXPRESS
                            UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN'S DECLARED POLICY TO CEASE INTERNAL PRODUCTION
                            WHEN NEIGHBORS ALSO BRING THEIR PRODUCTION UNDER CONTROL (AS TURKEY
                            APPEARS TO BE DOING) AND TO EXPRESS HOPE THAT IRAN WILL USE ITS
                            INFLUENCE IN APPROPRIATE <pb n="3" xml:id="d191-03" facs="d191-03"/>BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL FORUMS TO ENCOURAGE NEIGHBORS TO CEASE
                            OPIUM PRODUCTION AND TO SUPPORT EFFORTS US AND OTHER CONCERNED VICTIM
                            COUNTRIES MAY ALSO UNDERTAKE TO THIS END. IT MIGHT ALSO BE PRODUCTIVE IF
                            PRESIDENT WERE TO EXPRESS PARTICULAR INTEREST IN <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> FUND IN ORDER ENCOURAGE GREATER CONTRIBUTION FROM <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND POSSIBLY PRIVATE IRANIANS.</p>
                        <p>6. WE BELIEVE THIS IS AS FAR AS PRESIDENT SHOULD GO, AND WE RECOMMEND HE
                            NOT GET INTO ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WITH SHAH SUCH AS NEW REGIONAL
                            EFFORT OR OPIUM FREE ZONE. WE FAIL TO SEE HOW SUCH PROPOSALS CAN ADVANCE
                            OUR OBJECTIVES OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STIMULUS TO BILATERAL EFFORTS IN
                            COUNTRIES SUCH AS TURKEY, AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN. IF PROPOSED REGIONAL
                            GROUP IS TO ACT AS FRONT FOR US, WE DO NOT THINK THAT COUNTRIES
                            CONCERNED WOULD WELCOME THIS ROLE NOR COULD US HAND BE HIDDEN. IF
                            PURPOSE OF REGIONAL EFFORT IS TO BRING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON AFGHANISTAN,
                            IRAN IS HARDLY BEST INSTRUMENT TO USE AS ANY IRANIAN INITIATIVES EVEN
                            REMOTELY DIRECTED TO PROBLEM OF AFGHAN PRODUCTION WOULD BE
                            COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. FINALLY, CHANGING OF FOCUS FROM BILATERAL PROGRAMS
                            ALREADY UNDERWAY AND BEGINNING TO BEAR FRUIT TO YET ANOTHER REGIONAL
                            APPROACH OR EXPANDED MULTILATERAL PROGRAM WOULD, IN OUR VIEW, ONLY SERVE
                            TO DILUTE EFFORTS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.</p>
                        <p>7. EMBASSY CONCLUDES THEREFORE THAT THERE MAY WELL BE ADVANTAGE FOR
                            PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS NARCOTICS PROBLEM WITH SHAH AS OUTLINED ABOVE AND
                            TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR IRAN'S COOPERATION IN BILATERAL CONTROL
                            EFFORTS, INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND ADDICTION TREATMENT.</p>
                        <p>8. FOREGOING SUGGESTIONS COULD PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR LANGUAGE IN
                            COMMUNIQUE WHICH MIGHT ALSO NOTE THAT NARCOTICS CONTROL AND IRAN'S
                            EFFORTS IN GENERAL FIELD OF TREATMENT OF ADDITCTION ARE ENCOURAGING
                            SIGNS WHICH US IS FOLLOWING WITH INTEREST AS IT ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE ON
                            ITS OWN NARCOTICS CONTROL ACTION PROGRAM.</p>

                        <p>The Shah is highly gratified over your prospective visit to Tehran and
                            the recognition it will bring him as an important world figure. You will
                            be warmly welcomed by the Government, the media and the public. Your
                            visit will put both friends and adversaries in the region on notice that
                            we have important interests in the Gulf area we intend to maintain.</p>
                        <p>Your discussions will assure the Shah that your visits to Peking and
                            Moscow in no way dealt over the heads of Iran or other close friends.
                            You will want to convince him that we are not withdrawing into
                            isolation, and that we remain resolved to stand by our friends and meet
                            our commitments.</p>
                        <p>The Shah is deeply preoccupied with Soviet gains in South Asia and the
                            Middle East which he regards as threatening to isolate Iran. He
                            considers Iraq openly hostile and the rest of his Muslim neighbors as
                            internally unstable or precariously susceptible to radical subversion.
                            His concern has increased as a result of the recently concluded
                            Soviet-Iraqi treaty of understanding. He looks to us as a counterweight
                            but expects to be treated as an equal. He will want reassurances that we
                            will continue to cooperate with him, particularly in the military
                            field.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d192-02" facs="d192-02"/>
                        <p>You will want to assure him that we regard Iran as an outstanding example
                            of national independence and self-reliance, that we value our close
                            relationship highly, and that we have every intention of continuing to
                            cooperate with it. You will wish to encourage him to continue his policy
                            of trying to find ways of working closely with his neighbors,
                            particularly Pakistan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, in dealing with regional
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>You might review sympathetically the narcotics problem we share and the
                            measures that are being taken to deal with it.</p>
                        <p>Themes to be emphasized in public remarks are Iran as a success story, a
                            close and valued friend and a moderate and responsible regional power
                            willing and able to play a leading role in promoting and protecting area
                            security. At the same time, you will wish to avoid implying that Iran is
                            our "chosen instrument" or that it is dependent on us.</p>

                        <p>1. AS WASHINGTON AWARE, SHAH HAS HAD LONG-TIME AND OFT-REPEATED
                            DETERMINATION TO STRENGTHEN IIAF BY ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL WEAPONS
                            SYSTEMS AND REINFORCEMENT OF PRESENT AIRCRAFT STRENGTH. THIS
                            DETERMINATION HAS BEEN INTENSIFIED BY PAKISTANS DEFEAT AND DISMEMBERMENT
                            RESULTING FROM INDO-PAK WAR, GRAVE UNCERTAINTIES RE FUTURE STABILITY OF
                            WEST PAKISTAN, AND GROWTH OF SOVIET INFLUENCE IN INDIA AND INDIAN OCEAN
                            — ALL OF WHICH HAVE FORCED SHAH TO START PLANNING, REALLY FOR FIRST TIME
                            IN IRANS POST WW II HISTORY, FOR ARMED FORCES WHICH HAVE CAPABILITY TO
                            FACE DANGERS FROM EASTERN AND SOUTHERN BORDERS, AS WELL AS FROM WESTERN
                            FRONTIER.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH'S INTEREST IN SUCH ACQUISITIONS HAS NOW JELLED INTO THREE FORMAL
                            REQUESTS WHICH GENERAL TOURANIAN (DEPUTY MIN OF WAR FOR ARMAMENTS) HAS
                            RECENTLY SENT TO ARMISM/MAAG. THESE REQUESTS (REPORTED SEPARATELY IN
                            REFTEL) BOIL DOWN TO (A) REQUEST TO PURCHASE THREE SQUADRONS OF F-15
                            AIRCRAFT; (B) REQUEST TO PURCHASE UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF LASER-GUIDED
                            BOMBS, AND (C) REQUEST FOR COST INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OF
                            TWO ADDITIONAL SQUADRONS OF F-4E AIRCRAFT AND TWO ADDITIONAL SQUADRONS
                            OF F-5E AIRCRAFT.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d193-02" facs="d193-02"/>
                        <p>3. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT SHAH INSTRUCTED TOUFANIAN TO GET THESE FORMAL
                            REQUESTS ON TABLE BEFORE PRESIDENTS VISIT MAINLY TO ENSURE PRESIDENT
                            FULLY AWARE OF SHAH'S ACQUISITION PLANS AND ALSO IN EXPECTATION OR HOPE
                            PRESIDENT WILL BE ABLE TO INFORM SHAH ABOVE REQUESTS WILL BE MET BY
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> SUBJECT IN CASE OF F-15S TO
                            CAVEATS OF (A) SUCCESSFUL TESTING AND (B) PRODUCTION LINE SCHEDULE (AND
                            PRESUMABLY AGREEMENT ON PRICE).</p>
                        <p>4. WE, OF COURSE, RECOGNIZE DIFFICULTY THERE MAY BE FOR PRESIDENT TO GIVE
                            DEFINITIVE REPLY TO HIM ON FIRST TWO REQUESTS. WE CONSIDER IT VERY
                            IMPORTANT, HOWEVER, THAT PRESIDENT BE AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE.

                        </list>
                        <p>One of the Shah's main concerns in talking with the President will be
                            Soviet penetration in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and India, as
                            well as the situation in neighboring Pakistan. Since he will ask our
                            assessment, we have put together for you a package of recent
                            intelligence studies and memos done here that should provide you with a
                            firm basis for exchanging assessments with the Iranians. This is for
                            your background; the key points are reflected in your briefing memo to
                            the President. Attached you will find the following papers—summarized
                            below—dealing with these topics:</p>
                        <p>—At Tab A a memo produced at our request by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> assessing the development of and future Soviet role in
                            the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>—At Tab B are two papers we have prepared on the situations in (1) Iraq
                            and (2) Syria. The Shah is always concerned about Iraq, and the Syrian,
                            role is also of considerable interest to him.</p>
                        <p>—At Tab C is a short memo produced by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            at our request summarizing the development of Soviet military
                            involvement in Egypt over the past five years.</p>
                        <p>—At Tab D is a recently completed National Intelligence Estimate on the
                            short-term problems and prospects of Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>—At Tab E is a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memo that documents
                            how the Soviets increased their supply of arms to India in the months
                            leading up to war and especially in final critical days. It generally
                            confirms our earlier judgments but documents a somewhat higher level of
                            deliveries than we had seen en toto.</p>
                        <p>You will want to glance through these papers yourself, but just to give
                            you a quick review of what is involved, we have boiled out the main
                            conclusions.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d194-02" facs="d194-02"/>
                        <p>On the Soviet role in the Persian Gulf, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concludes (Tab A) that:</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets have consistently probed the Persian Gulf seeking, as
                            opportunities arose, to extend their political and military influence
                            into this region of traditional Russian concern.</p>
                        <p>—Most of the Soviet effort has been concerned with developing
                            governmental ties, and Iran, Iraq and Kuwait have all been responsive to
                            Soviet overtures. Moscow has been particularly successful in using
                            economic openings with Iran and Iraq to foster the growth of friendly
                            policies, although military supply has also been a major instrument. As
                            with Kuwait in the 1960s, the Soviets are now pressing for a presence in
                            the new Gulf States of Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as
                            well as in recently emerged Oman.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets are being cautious about encouraging subversive activity in
                            the Persian Gulf area.</p>
                        <p>—Although greater Soviet involvement in the Gulf area is virtually a
                            foregone conclusion, there are definite limits on Moscow's freedom to
                            maneuver. Most importantly, the Soviets seem to place a fairly high
                            value on their bilateral relationship with Iran and greater Soviet
                            activity in and attention to the Gulf could upset this. In the long run,
                            however, a stronger Soviet political position and a more obtrusive
                            military posture can be expected.</p>
                        <p>On the situation in Iraq and Syria, our conclusions (Tab B) are:</p>
                        <p>—Neither Iraq nor Syria behave reliably. They are not sure bets as firm
                            Soviet client states or as protectors of Soviet interests in the area,
                            which would include smooth relations with Egypt.</p>
                        <p>—Neither Iraq nor Syria will be able to sacrifice its dependence on the
                            Soviets for military and economic assistance of compromise its general
                            political orientation towards the eastern bloc while the Arab/Israeli
                            problem remains important. The Soviets will retain leverage and
                            influence on those accounts. This leverage could give the Soviets <pb n="3" xml:id="d194-03" facs="d194-03"/>a new lease on life in the
                            Persian Gulf via Iraq; it could also give them a somewhat stronger
                            bargaining position on the Arab/Israeli problem if Iraq (because of the
                            treaty) and Syria (moving towards a moderate stance) cooperate with
                            Soviet-Egyptian efforts.</p>
                        <p>—Iraq, more so than Syria, would seem of special interest to the Soviets,
                            though they will have to be careful to protect their relations with Iran
                            whose arch enemy in the area is Iraq. Iraq is the gateway to the Gulf;
                            Soviet naval facilities there or at a minimum an increased Soviet
                            presence in the area would be useful. Iraq also has potentially rich oil
                            fields; Soviet participation in these (now agreed) will help meet the
                            Soviet's long-range oil requirements and provide an extended reason for
                            staying in Iraq. Iraq could be a Soviet foothold independent of the
                            demands of the Arab-Israeli dispute.</p>
                        <p>—Syria, less strategically of interest and much poorer, would be useful
                            to the Soviets as part of a pattern of client states in the area,
                            demonstrating Soviet influence and furthering the Soviet bargaining
                            position on the Arab/Israeli problem. A friendship treaty (which the
                            Soviets are reported pressing) would formalize this pattern.</p>
                        <p>—The US has almost no influence at the present with either state.
                            However, the important checks to Soviet advances in either of them have
                            evolved from their strong sensitivities to outside influence or
                            domination. The Soviets will have to proceed cautiously and especially
                            so in the case of Iraq in order to protect Soviet-Iranian relations.</p>
                        <p>—Overreaction by the Shah to the present situation in Iraq or
                            over-confidence of the Iraqis because of their Soviet treaty could be
                            the causes for instability in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>You are already very familiar with the facts on Soviet military supply to
                            Egypt, but the attached <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memo (Tab
                            D), which includes a useful fold-out chart, may help to refresh your
                            picture of the pattern of Soviet arms deliveries. The study highlights
                            two basic lines of development:</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d194-04" facs="d194-04"/>
                        <p>—The volume of Soviet military deliveries has gone through several high
                            and low points since 1967. But through it all the Egyptians have been
                            built back up to and beyond their pre-war level in terms of- equipment,
                            although because of training and manpower problems they still lack the
                            capacity to challenge the Israelis by sustained offensive action. At the
                            same time, the Egyptians now have the capacity to make offensive action
                            and pre-emptive war by the Israelis much more costly.</p>
                        <p>—There has been a gradual; though substantial, buildup of the Soviets own
                            military position in Egypt, most of it associated with countering the US
                            Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>On the prospects for Pakistan, the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                            (Tab D) concludes that:</p>
                        <p>—While Pakistan must face pressing challenges and appears unlikely to
                            resolve all of them satisfactorily, it does not necessarily face
                            disaster.</p>
                        <p>—Given the many variables, it is not possible to estimate with any
                            confidence Bhutto's ability to bring off what is necessary to keep him
                            in power. To a large extent, his future depends on his ability to
                            negotiate with India in a manner that is acceptable to his people, and
                            to deal effectively with Pakistan's social, economic and political
                            problems. If Bhutto falls, a military takeover would be probable,
                            eventually if not immediately. Such a move could be initiated by
                            officers with outlooks similar to those of NASSER's or Qadhafi's in the
                            Arab world; i. e. nationalist radicals.</p>
                        <p>—For a "brighter future,” Pakistan must first achieve an acceptable and
                            amicable settlement with India and a stable political consensus under
                            either Bhutto, another civilian, or a military regime.</p>
                        <p>—Pakistan does not appear to be facing an immediate economic crisis, and
                            the basic infrastructure which is already sounder than that of many
                            lesser developed countries, is already there to build on. The necessary
                            adjustments caused by the disruptions of the war and the loss of "East
                            Pakistan" are being made, although there undoubtedly will still be some
                            hard days ahead.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d194-05" facs="d194-05"/>
                        <p>—There are centrifugal forces which threaten the breakup of Pakistan but
                            there are also strong unifying forces. Islam and fear of Hindu
                            domination are important factors and the army is still capable of
                            putting down any tribal revolt or other disturbances.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Soviet military supply to India, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has produced a study (Tab E) documenting the extent of
                            deliveries over the last year. The two main points that emerge are:</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets, as we know, played a very substantial role in building up
                            India's armed forces in the inter-war period (1965-1971) to the point
                            where the Indo-Pak military balance shifted decisively in India's
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>—In the nine months from the outbreak of fighting in East Pakistan in
                            March 1971 until the outbreak of war between India and Pakistan in
                            September, the Soviets clearly demonstrated their support for India by
                            making new commitments of arms valued at $300 million and actual
                            shipments from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern
                            Europe significantly increased India's inventory of major types of
                            ground force weaponry. As India upped the military and political
                            pressure on Pakistan to the point where war seemed almost inevitable,
                            the Soviets continued to pour in significant ground force equipment.</p>

                            on laser-guided bombs to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                            and recently part of this information has been made available to the

                        <p>BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>Since 1969 the Shah has focused increasingly on the issue of follow-on
                            aircraft to replace US supplied F-4's in his Air Force during the late
                            1970's. The Shah argues that a long lead time is required in the budget
                            and procurement cycle for such a major defense acquisition, and that
                            third countries have been trying to interest him in a prototype
                            aircraft, such as the French Mirage VIII, or other British/German MRCA.
                            In addition, the Shah argues that he will need an aircraft of the F-15
                            caliber to counter the "almost assured" introduction into neighboring
                            countries of the MIG-2 3 by the Soviet Union. We have briefed
                            representatives of the Government of Iran on the F-14 and F-15 aircraft
                            but have made no commitment for the sale. These aircraft are barely out
                            of the research and development stage, and the F-15's first flight test
                            is not scheduled until September 1972.</p>
                        <p>LIKELY IRANIAN POSITION:</p>
                        <p> Shah will ask for assurances that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will make available 3 squadrons of F-15 and a few F-14
                            with Phoenix missiles for sale to the Government of Iran at some
                            unspecified time in the future as follow-on aircraft or as a supplement
                            to his F-4 fighter fleet.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d195-04" facs="d195-04"/>
                        <p>RECOMMENDED U. S. POSITION:</p>
                        <p>There are two major factors that militate against making a positive
                            F-14/F-15 sales commitment, particularly with firm numbers and delivery
                            dates, to the Shah at this time. First, neither of these aircraft
                            programs has progressed to a point at which we can accurately predict
                            their availability. Second, we cannot foresee the world situation in the
                            latter half of this decade sufficient to permit a positive delivery date
                            and number commitment of these sophisticated and unique aircraft.
                            Conditions in the region by the time of aircraft availability might make
                            a sale counterproductive to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            interests. We must consider the possibility of priority need by our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or other allies and additional
                            requirements of our own. Therefore, recommend we tell the Shah that we
                            anticipate favorable action on the sale but the matter must be held in
                            abeyance until the programs become more stable and predictable. We will,
                            however, keep the Shah apprised of our progress on the development of
                            these weapons systems.</p>

                            request. Production and delivery schedules could be discussed at a later

                        <p>BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>In the early 1960's the Shah requested <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> assistance in modernizing his fighter aircraft fleet.
                            At that time he had 3 squadrons of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            F-86F's. We assisted the Shah by providing 2 squadrons of F-5A's under
                            Grant Aid and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> purchased 4
                            additional squadrons. In the late 1960's the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ordered 2 squadrons of F-4D's and 2 squadrons of
                            F-4E's. Almost before the first F-4's were delivered the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ordered 4 additional squadrons.
                            Recently they have indicated an interest in buying 2 more squadrons
                            making a total of 10 squadrons when all are delivered. Last year the
                            Shah decided to replace the older F-5A with the newer F-5E. He has
                            placed orders with Northrop for 8 squadrons. Recently the Shah has
                            indicated a desire to purchase 2 more squadrons of F-5E's that would
                            produce an inventory of 10 squadrons of this aircraft as well.</p>
                        <p>LIKELY IRANIAN POSITION:</p>
                        <p>The Shah will ask that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> approve
                            the sale of two additional squadrons of F-4E's and two of F-5E's.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDED U. S. POSITION:</p>
                        <p>Recommend you tell the Shah that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            will approve the sale of these aircraft and that price and availability
                            is now being studied by the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>. He
                            will be notified when negotiations can be expected to commence.</p>

                            Personnel</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>Since 1969 the U.S. Air Force has made available to the Imperial Iranian
                            Air Force (<gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss>) on a reimbursable
                            basis a Technical Assistance Field Team to help the <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> absorb the F-41s. The team has varied
                            in size from 54 to 83, and supplements our 200-man Military Assistance
                            Advisory Group (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>). As Iran takes
                            delivery of increasingly more complex U.S. military equipment, the
                            strain on the country's manpower base may become critical; thus the
                            Shah's desire for increased numbers of U. S. military technicians to
                            assist/train his key maintenance personnel. We have resisted the Shah in
                            this matter chiefly to keep our military profile low and to encourage
                            the Iranians to solve their own problems. When additional U.S.
                            assistance has become unavoidable, we have urged the Shah to hire
                            technical personnel from U. S. civilian contractors, a route he
                            considers unduly expensive and not fully responsive to his needs.</p>
                        <p>LIKELY IRANIAN POSITION:</p>
                        <p>The Shah will request a "bank account" of several hundred U. S. uniformed
                            technicians on which to draw on a fiscally reimbursable basis. He would
                            like to be assured that we will furnish the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> a team <pb n="8" xml:id="d195-08" facs="d195-08"/>of
                            skilled personnel at any time a requirement appears.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDED U. S. POSITION:</p>
                        <p>Although the U.S. generally opposes introducing military items into the
                            inventory of a country that is incapable of operating and maintaining
                            them properly, we recognize that political-military requirements may
                            occasionally dictate such a course. Should Iran acquire advanced items
                            where short-term technical help is required, we should try to help it
                            bridge the gap. Recommend you advise the Shah that, although our policy
                            is to reduce our military presence overseas and although we are under
                            heavy Congressional pressure in this regard, the U.S. Government will
                            try to assist the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> by providing on a
                            case-by-case basis selective U.S. military technical assistance where
                            such advice cannot be secured through a civilian contractor.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Setting and Purpose</p>
                        <p>The two main purposes of your talks with the Shah will be (a) to assure
                            his understanding of your global strategy and (b) to encourage him in
                            his efforts to knit tighter regional cooperation among those who want to
                            resist Soviet pressures in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>You will find the mood in Iran a mixture of pride and confidence on the
                            one hand and anxiety on the other.</p>
                        <p>The pride stems from Iran's achievements over the past decade,
                            particularly the progress of the Shah's "white revolution" and Iran's
                            increasing economic independence with a growth rate above 10% yearly
                            over the past five years. With this has gone an enhanced international
                            status, which the Shah symbolized in the 2500th Anniversary celebrations
                            last fall. Iran is a country to be reckoned with in the regional
                            context.</p>
                        <p>At the same time there is recognition that these rapid changes are
                            producing increasing internal dislocations and pressures against a
                            background of changes in the areas around Iran. This leads to anxiety on
                            two fronts: (a) The Shah is concerned that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may find ways to facilitate the overflow into Iran of
                            the instability that has developed in Pakistan, Iraq and Turkey. (b)
                            Coupled with this is concern that Iran's stability and progress are too
                            exclusively dependent on the Shah's firm personal leadership and that
                            institutions and leaders are not evolving that could make an orderly
                            transition if he were to pass from the scene. The Shah himself has
                            voiced concern on this point from time to time.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d196-02" facs="d196-02"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Shah's Specific Concerns</p>
                        <p>In the Shah's view, the situation in the Middle East, South Asia and the
                            Indian Ocean has changed markedly over the last year. For this reason,
                            he has been eager to talk with you and to have the demonstration of US
                            support which will come from a visit. His specific concerns are
                            these:</p>
                        <p>1. He sees the Soviet pacts with Egypt, India and Iraq as evidence of
                            serious changes which have occurred to Soviet advantage in the overall
                            balance of forces in the Middle East and South Asia since a year ago. He
                            has said a number of times that, while he does not oppose East-West
                            detente in Europe this detente will pose dangers for Iran in tempting
                            the Soviets to expand into the Middle East and South Asia. The recent
                            Soviet treaty with Iraq and the quick Soviet move to establish
                            diplomatic relations with the new Union of Arab Emirates were most
                            disturbing to him as evidence that the Soviets now plan to pursue their
                            interests in the Persian Gulf actively. He was deeply shaken by what
                            happened to Pakistan in December.</p>
                        <p>2. Going hand and hand with this Soviet thrust, he sees the increasing
                            threat posed by situations on both sides of Iran. He is expanding his
                            air defense system so that it will completely ring his borders.</p>
                        <p>—The Shah saw December's events in South Asia not only in terms of the
                            Soviets improving their position but with the fear that further
                            disintegration in Pakistan could spill over into Iranian Baluchistan. He
                            is worried about substantial Soviet capabilities in Afghanistan, which
                            is vulnerable to the same kind of disintegration. The Shah has been
                            impressed with President Bhutto's efforts to hold Pakistan together, and
                            he will probably see Bhutto after your visit. Nevertheless, the
                            situation on his eastern borders is a cause of concern as never in the
                            recent past.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d196-03" facs="d196-03"/>
                        <p>—While Iraq is inherently unstable, the Shah is concerned about the
                            subversive efforts of which Iraq is capable, especially in Kuwait, in
                            the Persian Gulf sheikdoms in Saudi Arabia and in Jordan. These
                            conditions lead him to the conclusion that Iran must be as strong as
                            possible militarily to serve as a deterrent at least to the regional
                            manifestations of Soviet encroachment.</p>
                        <p>3. In this connection, he may mention his plans for further modernizing
                            his air force or possibly his new scheme to develop a combination air
                            and naval base at Chah Bahar on the southern coast of Iran outside the
                            Persian Gulf. His most recent requests boil down to a request to
                            purchase three squadrons of F-15 aircraft when they are operational,
                            laser-guided bombs and two additional squadrons each of F-4E and F-5E
                            aircraft. Detailed responses are in your talking points, and I shall be
                            prepared to speak to these issues. Generally, our response is to be
                            helpful within the practical limits of weapons production. On the port,
                            a Defense Department survey team has just submitted a report to the
                            Shah. He is seeking financing through private American banks and
                            contractors, and Robert Elsworth at Lazard Freres has been involved in
                            trying to put together a consortium for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>4.In addition to providing for Iran's own military strength, the Shah in
                            recent years has worked hard to build a close association with
                            like-minded governments around him. He has, of course, sought to provide
                            for the security of Iran through his country's development and through
                            his participation in international organizations like <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and the Organization for Regional
                            Cooperation and Development. But his principal vehicle has been a series
                            of informal and clandestine relationships with Israel and Turkey on the
                            one hand and with Saudi Arabia and Jordan on the other. You will want to
                            read Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>' memo at Tab B
                            describing these relationships in detail. In short, however, the Shah
                            has made a substantial effort in a quiet way to build a strong
                            relationship with like-minded governments around him. One of the
                            principal channels for maintaining <pb n="4" xml:id="d196-04" facs="d196-04"/>these relationships is Kamal Adham, King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName>'s brother-in-law and chief of
                            Saudi intelligence. He has made a series of stops in Cairo, Amman and
                            Tehran in recent weeks, and it is he who has talked with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> about Jordan's role in the
                            Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>5. The Shah in connection with building his regional associations has
                            made a move since the death of NASSER to build a closer relationship
                            with Egypt. Although he has been disappointed by President <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>'s actions in the past few
                            months and is concerned about his relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he has been generally impressed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>. Along with Saudi
                            Arabia, he has viewed Sadat as perhaps even a potential defector from
                            the Soviet camp. His interest in promoting such a development has led
                            him over the past year to become increasingly critical of Israel's
                            strategy of stonewalling all efforts at diplomatic movement. Israel has
                            long shared an interest with Iran in cutting Iraq and Egypt down to
                            size, and Iran has provided a reliable source of Israeli oil despite
                            Arab objections. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>'s
                            concern at the shift in the Shah's attitude toward Egypt has caused her
                            to try to mend her fences with the Shah on the eve of your arrival.</p>
                        <p>6. The Shah recognizes the changes that are taking place in the economic
                            organization of the world. He sees major economic blocs emerging and he
                            feels that the Middle East should organize itself to deal more
                            effectively with the principal world power blocs. He sees the need for
                            regional development in the Middle East and believes that he probably
                            has as good credentials as anyone for asserting some leadership in the
                            region.</p>
                        <p>7. The Shah has been deeply concerned about Turkey. He feels that Turkey
                            has lost its sense of direction in world affairs, and this is
                            exascerbated by its domestic political stresses.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What We Want from the Visit</p>
                        <p>1. You will be describing to the Shah the strategy lying behind your
                            trips to Peking and to Moscow and the purpose behind your recent
                            decisions on Southeast Asia. The Shah will understand your efforts to
                            establish a framework of relationships between the nuclear powers that
                            will permit regional powers like Iran to play the principal role in
                            contributing to stability in their areas. The Shah has long understood
                            the principles of <pb n="5" xml:id="d196-05" facs="d196-05"/>the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine—the necessity
                            for great-power relationships that will permit countries like Iran, as
                            the world changes, to develop the capacity to do what the US can no
                            longer do around the world in providing the principal ingredients of
                            regional security and stability.</p>
                        <p>2. Within this framework we want the Shah to understand that we are alert
                            to the attention that the Soviet Union is giving to the area from Egypt
                            through India and we want to encourage the Shah's efforts to knit a
                            close regional association with those nations in his area that want to
                            resist the Soviet pressures. We want to encourage the Shah in his
                            special associations with Israel and Turkey, with Kings <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> and
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> and even with <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>. In your private conversations
                            with the Shah you can let him know that we are aware of the special
                            relationship which he has developed through his own private channels and
                            that we shall support it. You can tell him that you discussed Jordan's
                            role in the regional context when King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> last visited Washington and encouraged King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in this direction as
                            well. You might even wish to comment on the special effectiveness of the
                            kind of special channels which the Shah is using to build this
                            relationship since those channels save the partners the political
                            embarrassment of publicity.</p>
                        <p>3. Since an important issue in the Shah's mind now is how he will bring
                            President <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> into this
                            association and away from the Soviet camp, you may wish to talk in some
                            detail with the Shah about his views on those prospects. The answer, of
                            course, will revolve around an Arab-Israeli settlement. We do not
                            envision a specific role for the Shah at this point, but it might be
                            well to ask the Shah how he feels he might play a role, giving his
                            relationship both with <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>
                            and with Israel. Given Iran's position as Israel's main oil supplier and
                            close communication with Israel, it has been suggested that the Israelis
                            would pay particular attention to any role the Shah might play in
                            participating in a guarantee of the security of the water routes from
                            the Mediterranean into the Persian Gulf. We have no specific idea in
                            this connection, but you might wish to explore it with him tentatively
                            and lay the ground work for later possible involvement.</p>
                        <p>4. The question of oil relationships will probably come up. The context,
                            of course, is that the US as well as Western Europe will become
                            increasingly dependent on Middle East oil over the coming decade. In the
                            shorter term, the Shah has pressed the oil companies hard for an
                            increasing share of the revenues. You may want to tell the Shah that,
                            while you recognize his concern to maximize oil earnings, you know you
                            can count on him to <pb n="6" xml:id="d196-06" facs="d196-06"/>preserve
                            the stability of energy relationships. You will recall Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName>'s memo to you urging that you
                            not encourage the Shah to expect special access to the US market for
                            Iranian oil. It is possible that the Shah will put less emphasis on
                            access to the US market than he has in the past because Iran will
                            probably have little difficulty in marketing its oil elsewhere given the
                            expanding world needs. Nevertheless, any remarks you might make on this
                            subject could be put in the context of our need once again to look at
                            our whole situation and to relate suppliers to it.</p>
                        <p>5. It may be worth mentioning your attack on the narcotics problem. In
                            some ways, Iran shares our part of the problem. Iran had stopped
                            production in the middle 1950s but then was the victim of imports from
                            Afghanistan and Turkey. At that point, Iran tried to close its borders
                            and began producing enough opium again to meet the needs of its own
                            addict population. It has been proposed that we try to move toward an
                            opium free zone which would include not only Turkey and Iran but
                            Pakistan and Afghanistan as well. We are not at the point of being able
                            to carry this through yet, but you might want to mention your concern
                            about the problem to the Shah and your desire to cooperate with him on
                            it. We are proposing a general paragraph in the communique on
                            cooperation in this area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Backup Papers</p>
                        <p>Further material is at the following tabs:<lb/> —At Tab A are talking
                            points.<lb/> —At Tab B is an important memo from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> on the Shah's role as a regional
                            leader and his clandestine relationships with Turkey, Israel, Jordan and
                            Saudi Arabia.<lb/> —At Tab C is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' memorandum.<lb/> —At Tab D is a copy of the
                            schedule.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the schedule, it is worth noting that the Shah plans a
                            substantive talk after his dinner for you. Your proposed remarks have
                            been drafted with an eye toward your making a statement on the essential
                            principles of your global strategy. Too often, we feel that this has not
                                <pb n="7" xml:id="d196-07" facs="d196-07"/>been clearly understood,
                            and there would be no better platform for restating your views than
                            Tehran. What you have to say could not be offensive either to your
                            earlier Soviet hosts or to anyone in the Middle East, and yet it is a
                            highly important subject.</p>

                        <p>May 19, 1972</p>
                        <p rend="center">TALKING POINTS</p>
                        <p>1. Iran's strength, vitality, bold leadership, and willingness to assume
                            regional responsibility, are a classic example of what the United States
                            under the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine values
                            highly in an ally. Indeed, the Shah was one of the earliest proponents
                            of the new global approach you have been pursuing. Iran has earned — and
                            will have—our firm support over the long term, because:</p>
                        <p>— Our support will be effective because of Iran's own national strength
                            and effective regional leadership.</p>
                        <p>— This kind of supportive role is a role the U.S. will sustain over the
                            long term.</p>
                        <p>— The US-Iranian partnership is a crucial pillar of the global structure
                            of peace the US is seeking to build. Your trips to Peking and Moscow
                            exemplify your effort to develop a secure balance among the great
                            powers. Great-power restraint—which we are seeking to build into the
                            system — devolves more responsibility onto regional powers. The US is
                            counting on Iran to make a major contribution to regional and Third
                            World stability, in the Persian Gulf and indeed in the Middle East and
                            the whole non-aligned world.</p>
                        <p>2. We fully recognize — and view with concern — the attention which the
                            Soviet Union is giving to the area from Egypt through India.</p>
                        <p>— The Soviets have continued to deliver increasingly sophisticated
                            weaponry to Egypt and on the eve of your trip to Moscow there was a show
                            of new weapons systems in Egypt. [There was some indication that the
                            Egyptians are now being trained on the TU-16 bomber with air to surface
                            missiles. The T-62 tank appeared in Egypt for the first time. Soviet
                            TU-22 bombers, the BLINDERS, appeared on a visit to Egypt.]</p>
                        <p>— The Soviets seem to have opened a new chapter in their longstanding
                            cultivation of Iraq with the recent signing of their Friendship Treaty.
                            This is cause for concern even though Iran would seem to be an
                            inherently unstable base for Soviet operations.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d196-09" facs="d196-09"/>
                        <p>— Stability in the Persian Gulf is far from assured, though the
                            transition following the change in the British status was smoother than
                            we might have anticipated — largely due to the Shah's skillful
                            leadership. We recognize that the Soviets have also moved quickly to
                            establish their relationship with the Union of Arab Emirates and that
                            the Soviets could be moving toward a naval presence with facilities in
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p>— As the Shah knows, we were deeply concerned by last December's crisis
                            in South Asia. We very much valued his support. We saw the crisis as an
                            example of Indian and Soviet violations of just the principles which we
                            feel need to be established for a more orderly world. The US is doing
                            all it can to help President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> get on his feet, but in his relationships with
                            India there is not a great deal we can do. We will, however, support his
                            economic program fully. We face a difficult situation in renewing the
                            supply of arms because our Congress is set against it and could destroy
                            a substantial portion of our other military assistance programs over
                            this issue. [Bear in mind that, while the Shah wants to see Bhutto
                            succeed, he has always been suspicious of him.]</p>
                        <p>3. The US will do what it can to support the efforts of nations in the
                            broader Middle East to hold their own against Soviet pressures, but the
                            keystone of our strategy will be a strong association among those
                            nations of the region that wish to resist Soviet pressures.</p>
                        <p>— You are aware of the private relationships which the Shah has built
                            with Turkey and Israel on the one hand and with Kings <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> and
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> on the other. While the US wishes to
                            leave this a regional initiative, you want the Shah to know that we
                            encourage it and support it wholeheartedly.</p>
                        <p>— You fully understand the private manner in which the Shah has conducted
                            these relationships. It permits the partners to relate to each other as
                            their real interests dictate without the inhibitions that publicity
                            poses.</p>
                        <p>— When King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> was in
                            Washington, you discussed Jordan's role in this regional context. You
                            gave him your encouragement. In this case as well, we want this to be
                            essentially a program in which the regional countries take the lead.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d196-10" facs="d196-10"/>
                        <p>— In the Persian Gulf, the US does not have any aspirations to assume the
                            British role. This is an area where a new kind of US presence must
                            evolve; in substantial part it will be provided by American business,
                            technological, educational and diplomatic relationships. We mean this to
                            be a serious and coherent US presence for a long-term constructive
                            relationship with the Islamic world.</p>
                        <p>—For the moment we are keeping our small naval force in the Gulf. The
                            Shah has some reservations about this, and you may wish him to discuss
                            them frankly with you. [He has recently said he fears that the present
                            US force of three ships is too small to do any good and yet just large
                            enough to provoke the Soviets to seek a presence of their own. He has
                            suggested that perhaps the US should either withdraw or increase its
                            force. ] We have maintained what we have there on the grounds that our
                            withdrawal now would give the wrong kind of signals. It is a tangible
                            symbol of the US's interest in the area's security and stability. We
                            plan to beef it up qualitatively. Iran's strength and this visible US
                            support are the best guarantee of regional deterrence.</p>
                        <p>4. The Arab-Israeli issue has been on dead center for some months now.
                            The Israelis have been increasingly outspoken publicly about their
                            desires for basic territorial changes to enhance their security.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> has become
                            increasingly frustrated by this evidence that Israel does not plan to
                            withdraw to anything like pre-war borders. The Soviets have not shown
                            much give. But it is in the interests of the US and its friends to try
                            to remove this impasse, which is a menace to world peace.</p>
                        <p>- You would welcome the Shah's views from his contacts with the Israelis
                            and Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>- Does he see any role for himself?</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d196-11" facs="d196-11"/>
                        <p>5. The Shah can be assured of continuing US cooperation with Iran. There
                            are some limitations on our resources, but the Shah should rest assured
                            that the US will do its best to help. On his weapons requests if he
                            raises them:</p>
                        <p>—Two additional squadrons each of F-4Es and F-5Es: We will approve the
                            sale of these aircraft. The Defense Department is drawing together data
                            on price and availability.</p>
                        <p>—F-15/F-14 aircraft: These will not become operational with our forces,
                            by present schedule, until late 1974. We anticipate selling them to
                            Iran, but we want to be sure we have a good product before we commit
                            ourselves. We had a bad experience selling the F-III before testing it
                            operationally. But we will stay in close touch with the Shah.</p>
                        <p>—Laser-guided bombs: We would prefer not to supply these [because they
                            represent our most advanced technology and are in heavy demand in
                            Southeast Asia where our forces have just begun using them]. We are able
                            to supply other guided bombs such as the Walleye and the Hobo.</p>
                        <p>—If he mentions his concern that the FOXBAT will turn up in Iraq, you can
                            say that we believe that the model of the Phantom (F-4E) that is
                            scheduled for delivery to Iran next year is capable of defending against
                            the FOXBAT.</p>
                        <p>6. You may wish to describe the major efforts you have made to resolve
                            the narcotics problem in the US. You could put this in the context of
                            how many of the important relationships that will help to build the
                            structure of world peace will be in fields like cooperation in resolving
                            basic human and environmental problems. You are aware that Iran has many
                            of the same problems in the narcotics field that the US has. We would
                            like to move toward fuller cooperation in this area. One of the ideas
                            that has been proposed is having a regionally initiated opium free zone
                            among Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not pushing a
                            particular proposal now, but we would welcome the Shah's interest and
                            initiative with his neighbors in this important area.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d196-12" facs="d196-12"/>
                        <p>7. In the petroleum field, we will welcome the Shah's help in preserving
                            the stability of energy supply.</p>
                        <p>—If he mentions access to US markets, you could explain the political
                            difficulties of our import program, while saying we will look
                            sympathetically at any proposal.</p>
                        <p>One final point is a small one in a similar field. We have invested a
                            great deal in making the INTELSAT system operative worldwide, and we
                            hope that Iran will be able to ratify the convention before the close of
                            the year. It may be touch-and-go to get the necessary 54 ratifications
                            by December 22.</p>

                            MANDATORY OIL IMPORT PROGRAM. YOU DID INDICATE SYMPATHY FOR THIS POLICY
                            TO HIM DURING HIS VISIT TO WASHINTON IN 1969. IF THE SHAH BRINGS UP OIL
                            RELATIONS, YOU MIGHT SAY THAT YOU ARE PLEASED TO HEAR PROGRESS IS BEING
                            MADE IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CONSORTIUM. YOU COULD INDICATE
                            PARTICULAR PLEASURE THAT THE CONSORTIUM'S PROJECTED LIFTING OF OIL FROM
                            IRAN ON FAVORABLE TERMS WILL REACH BY 1972 THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT
                            SUPPORTABLE BY IRAN'S CURRENT PROVED RESERVES. IF THE SHAH BRINGS UP
                            ACCESS TO THE U.S. MARKET, YOU MIGHT POINT OUT THE GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT
                            GRANTING ACCESS TO ONE COUNTRY WOULD CAUSE US IN OUR RELATIONS WITH ALL
                            OTHER OIL EXPORTING COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>NEXT MEETING BETWEEN THE SHAH AND THE CONSORTIUM NEGOTIATORS WILL BE ON

                            TALKS: IRAN HAS BEEN CAREFUL TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE
                            ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>) ON PARTICIPATION BY MEMBER COUNTRIES IN PRODUCING
                            COMPANIES OPERATING ON THEIR TERRITORIES GAVE MEMBERS THE CHOICE OF
                            NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR COMPANIES INDIVIDUALLY OR IN GROUPS. FURTHERMORE,
                            THESE RESOLUTIONS, AGAIN AS A RESULT OF IRANIAN DIPLOMACY, DELIBERATELY
                            DO NOT DEFINE "PARTICIPATION" IN ANY WAY. THIS POINT IS VERY IMPORTANT
                            TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WHICH RESENTS ARAB ATTEMPTS
                            TO REPRESENT THE 20PC OWNERSHIP FORMULA AS THE AUTHORIZED OPEC STANDARD
                            FOR PARTICIPATION. THE IRANIANS INSIST THAT THEIR APPROACH OF
                            NEGOTIATING FOR SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND OIL AND FOR EXPANDED
                            FACILITIES MEETS OPEC REQUIREMENTS JUST AS FULLY AS THE ARABS DEMAND FOR
                            RIGID OWNERSHIP FORMULA. THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>

                            DEMAND LEAVES NO ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION, IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR IRAN SINCE
                            IT WOULD FORCE IRAN TO PUT UP 20PC OF THE CAPITAL FOR THE VERY EXTENSIVE
                            EXPANDING FACILITIES THE CONSORTIUM WILL UNDERTAKE HERE IN THE NEXT FEW
                            YEARS (UNDER THE CONSORTIUM AGREEMENT THESE FACILITIES BELONG TO IRAN AS
                            SOON AS COMPLETED IN ANY CASE), AND THAT IT OFFERS NO ASSURANCE OF
                            GREATLY INCREASED OIL INCOME TO IRAN. FINALLY, AND MOST FUNDAMENTALLY,
                            THE PARTICIPATION IRAN SEEKS IS BY ITS NATIONAL OIL COMPANY IN THE

                        <p>The Shah welcomed the President warmly to Tehran. He congratulated the
                            President on the success of our foreign policy and the Moscow Summit in
                            particular. It was a masterpiece of strength on one side and dexterity
                            on the other. Our friends, the Shah emphasized, were indeed reassured.
                            But the Shah was worried about "this region" [the Middle East].</p>
                        <p>The President thanked the Shah for his welcome and his kind words. When
                            we arranged this trip, he explained, it all had to come together. Going
                            to China made the Russian trip possible. Taking strong action in Vietnam
                            [the May 8 measures] did not thwart the Moscow Summit. There was no
                            reason for euphoria or for the assumption that the Soviet leaders had
                            changed their long-term goals. What convinced us of that was Soviet
                            behavior in the 1971 India-Pakistan crisis. The Soviet leaders placed
                            security considerations above Communism. What was on their mind was
                            Europe and almost certainly China; they were trying to outflank the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The United States, the President continued, was proceeding on a
                            step-by-step basis. We made agreements where it was in the common
                            interest. The President had told BREZHNEV we would see Indochina
                            through, but he had told him a confrontation with the US was more likely
                            in the Middle East. The Politburo wanted better relations with us. We,
                            for our part, wanted better relations with them. But we wanted to make
                            sure no small crises would blow into big ones.</p>
                        <p>We appreciated the Shah's role in South Asia, the President said. His
                            personal view was that if India with the support of Soviet arms had
                            gobbled <pb n="2" xml:id="d200-02" facs="d200-02"/>up West Pakistan,
                            other states would have been in danger — not from the Indians, because
                            of their incompetence, but from the Soviets. We came to visit Iran
                            because we considered it symbolic of our strong support for our friends.
                            We would not let down our friends.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> if he had anything to add.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> summed up the Soviet
                            strategy of selective detente. They would make settlements on some
                            matters with some adversaries in order to isolate others, particularly
                            the Chinese. We had to be careful. It was important to establish the
                            principle of great-power restraint. We had sought to bring this home to
                            the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Shah expressed his agreement that a policy of confrontation was
                            impossible. There were key areas, he stressed, which could not be
                            neglected — such as Europe and the Middle East. The Shah gave the
                            figures on Europe's and Japan's dependence on oil from the Middle East.
                            Libya's oil would go dry in another decade and a half, he said. The US
                            would have to get more and more of its oil from the Middle East. We
                            could not allow ourselves to get in a position where we could be cut
                            off. That crazy fellow Mossadegh did it, the President remarked. He was
                            nuts, the Shah agreed.</p>
                        <p>Last year, two months after signing the treaty with the Soviets the
                            Indians attacked, the Shah said. He didn't want to be told that the
                            Soviets were restraining their clients. "We will not hand over our
                            country. We will pursue a scorched earth policy. They will have to shoot
                            their way in.”</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Shah if our allies were afraid of the Summit. Not
                            if you have the right allies, the Shah replied. If they are self-reliant
                            they will welcome it. If they have the principle of fighting until the
                            last American they will not welcome it. Iran, like Israel, must be able
                            to stand alone. The Shah therefore hoped that we had more blue suiters
                            available; Iran also had to have the most modern weapons. We could not
                            have a situation where the US cut off arms to any client of the Soviet
                            Union. He was afraid the Soviets would establish a coalition of the
                            Kurds, the Baathists, and the Communists; the Kurdish problem instead of
                            being a thorn in the side could become an asset to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked what could be
                            done. Turkey needs strengthening, the Shah replied. Iran can help with
                            the Kurds.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d200-03" facs="d200-03"/>
                        <p>How about Greece, the President asked. The Shah replied that the King was
                            a nice man but a fool. He was objectively worried about Papandreou. The
                            colonels must be supported. The King could stay if he kept quiet.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about Afghanistan. The Shah replied that the King of
                            Afghanistan was lazy. There were pressures in West Pakistan and
                            Pushtunistan and Baluchistan. This would then encircle Iran and give the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a corridor to the sea. The
                            Shah had warned Yahya about his stupidity, but he could not accept this
                            naked deliberate aggression.</p>
                        <p>The President then discussed the circumstances under which we would
                            restore economic aid to India. The Shah remarked that if we could give
                            some aid to India to save Pakistan, that was okay. But the main problem
                            was to save West Pakistan. The President agreed that the Shah was right,
                            and suggested they talk the next day about this. Iran could be a proxy
                            for Pakistan, the Shah suggested. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that we then had to reestablish
                            Pakistan's arms program to make Pakistan eligible for third-country
                            transfers from Iran. That we must do, the President agreed. Otherwise
                            Pakistan will be jumped. The Shah pointed out that he was offering
                            Afghanistan everything.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that the US was willing to reconsider the
                            question of the US naval deployment in the Persian Gulf. The Shah stated
                            that he had wanted to exclude the other major powers from the Gulf after
                            the British left and had therefore expressed concern about the small US
                            naval force. But after the Soviet-Indian treaty there was something to
                            be said for showing the flag there. Iran nevertheless was the only
                            country capable of dealing with any situation without any outside help.
                            He would study it.</p>

                        <p>The Shah began the conversation with a discussion of terrorism and the
                            pressures on him from the left wing. There was pressure on the Shah from
                            Brandt. The Shah claimed that the trouble came mostly from Baghdad, or
                            at least Baghdad would take credit for it. There were dangers emerging
                            in Oman, the Shah continued, where the rebels were completely supported
                            by the Communists. There was also a great danger facing the Saudis. The
                            regime was very backward; there was no inclination to reform. The King
                            had a Bedouin army to deal with the regular army.</p>
                        <p>After a brief digression on the pure Iranian architectural style of the
                            mausoleum, the Shah returned to the subject of Saudi Arabia. The Shah
                            was convinced the Saudis would not be spared by the Egyptians once the
                            Israeli problem was settled. They had a superiority complex but they
                            were lousy fighters. The head of the Saudi <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposed to the U.S. through the Shah to work out a
                            Saudi-Iranian-Egyptian grouping to stop Communism. The Shah had told
                            Oman that we would fulfill any request they had for assistance in
                            defeating the guerrillas. He would discuss with the British the
                            questions of the Indian Ocean and possible joint maneuvers in the
                            Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Shah emphasized the importance of making some progress toward an
                            Arab-Israeli settlement. He recognized the Israelis' concerns for their
                            security after their having fought three wars for it. Still he thought
                            they <pb n="2" xml:id="d201-02" facs="d201-02"/>were too stubborn. On
                            the other hand the Arabs were not mature; they were flamboyant and
                            always trespassing on the rights of others.</p>
                        <p>As for Iran, the Shah continued, the Persian Gulf was key. Iran had
                            established relations with Ethiopia and South Africa to make sure there
                            was a common policy in the Indian Ocean. Iran would deal even with
                            Australia for this purpose. Turkey was an essential element of this
                            strategy. If its domestic structure disintegrated this would be a total
                            disaster. But they may pull through. They had just cracked down on
                            subversives and arrested another 2,000.</p>
                        <p>What had been the problem with Erim? the President asked. The military
                            wanted to dominate, the Shah replied. But they also wanted to keep the
                            existing institutions. It was a hard balance to strike. The problem was
                            the absence of reforms. "So you ascribe your success to staying ahead of
                            the discontent?" the President asked. The Shah said "yes. Our farmers
                            own their own land. As for the universities, we just put subversives
                            into jail.” The Shah even thought Mao wanted a strong Iran; he had the
                            impression that the PRC preferred to have good ties with Iran. The
                            Chinese were reliable friends, as they proved in Pakistan. The Empress
                            was going to visit Peking.</p>
                        <p>If you looked at Russia under the Tsars, it had a rough government — the
                            same system, with secret police and priests (now commissars). Communism
                            became legitimate with victory in the Second World War. How come China
                            couldn't be ruled for centuries? It needed an iron fist, and the only
                            iron fist the world accepted was this sort of regime. Only a Communist
                            regime there could stand up to the Russians. Communism was a pretext to
                            rule China with a firm hand. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            was an imperialist country.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the question of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
                            Didn't Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> refuse a
                            settlement? He asked the Shah if other Israelis were more reasonable.
                            Less and less as time goes on, the Shah replied. Eban used to say he was
                            willing to leave alone all the territories except for minor
                            rectifications with Jordan. But now even he was less flexible. The
                            President had to urge Israel to be more flexible. The Shah personally
                            thought a Sinai settlement giving one-third to Israel was possible.
                            Israel, he affirmed, was Iran's natural ally. The President wondered if
                            one could sell this to the Arabs. Only to the King of Jordan, the Shah
                            replied.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d201-03" facs="d201-03"/>
                        <p> NASSER was a disaster, the Shah continued. An evil man. The question was
                            how could we check Soviet penetration. The Egyptians suffered from
                            megalomania. The President commented that they reminded him of the
                            Indians, tricky and withdrawn. The Shah remarked that the Indians could
                            fight and kill but the Egyptians could not. There was practically an
                            aerial bridge of military supply from Moscow to Cairo but the Soviets
                            gave all the electronic counter-measure equipment to the Indians.</p>
                        <p>The President said he has been impressed by the number of Iranians who
                            had gone to school in the U. S. He wondered if they would be turned into
                            subversives. "Are your students infected? Can you do anything?" The Shah
                            mentioned that our military personnel are no problem. He wanted blue
                            suiters [U. S. military technical personnel], military men who would not
                            leave in a pinch.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the President agreed to furnish Iran
                            with laser bombs and F-14s and F-15s. He asked the Shah to understand
                            the purpose of American policy. "Protect me,” he said. "Don't look at
                            detente as something that weakens you but as a way for the United States
                            to gain influence.” The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            Doctrine was a way for the U. S. to build a new long-term policy on
                            support of allies. This was the President's view: the American
                            intellectual community didn't reflect U. S. policy. Who is bad, who is
                            good, among intellectuals? The President asked rhetorically. It was hard
                            to tell. The majority were failures.</p>

                            OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY THE SHANSHAH ARYA. MEHR AND HER IMPERIAL MAJESTY
                            THE SHBANOU OF IRAN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND
                            MRS. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">RICHARD NIXON</persName> PAID AN
                            OFFICIAL VISIT TO IRAN FROM MAY 30 TO MAY 31, 1972. THE PRESIDENT AND
                            MRS. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> WERE RECEIVED WITH
                            EXCEPTIONAL FRIENDLINESS AND WARMTH BY THEIR IMPERIAL MAJESTIES AND BY
                            THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF IRAN.</p>
                        <p>DURING HIS VISIT THE PRESIDENT HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY
                            THE SHANSHAH IN A WARMAND CORDIAL ATMOSPHERE, REFLECTING THE CLOSE AND
                            FRIENDLY RELATIONS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT AND HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY DISCUSSED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON
                            THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE. THE PRESIDENT TOLD HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY OF HIS
                            VISITS TO MOSCOW AND PEKING AND OF HIS EFFORTS TO REDUCE EAST-WEST
                            TENSIONS AND RESTORE PEACE AND STABILITY TO SOUTHEAST ASIA. THEY HELD
                            THE VIEW THAT THE CONFLICT IN INDOCHINA SHOULD BE SETTLED THROUGH
                            NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS COULD SERVE AS A BASIS FOR
                            RESOLVING PROBLEMS AMONG THE STATES IN THE AREA AND FOR GUARANTEEING
                            THEIR RIGHT OF SELF- DETERMINATION WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT AND HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY ALSO DISCUSSED DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
                            MIDDLE EAST. THEY WERE GRATIFIED THAT A CEASEFIRE CONTINUES TO BE
                            OBSERVED BUT EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN OVER THE SERIOUS SITUATION EXISTING
                            IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND REAFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A PEACEFUL
                            SETTLEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 242.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT AND HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY AGREED THAT THE SECURITY AND
                            STABILITY OF THE PERSIAN GULF IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE LITTORAL
                            STATES. BOTH WERE OF THE VIEW THAT THE LITTORAL STATES BORE THE PRIMARY
                            RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY OF THE PERSIAN GULF.</p>
                        <p>HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY REAFFIRMED IRAN'S DETERMINATION TO BEAR ITS SHARE OF
                            THIS RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT AND HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY ALSO AGREED THAT THE ECONOMIC
                            DEVELOPMENT AND WELFARE OF THE BORDERING STATES OF THE PERSIAN GULF ARE
                            OF IMPORTANCE TO THE STABILITY OF THE REGION.</p>
                        <p>IRAN DECLARED ITSELF READY AND WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH ITS <pb n="3" xml:id="d202-03" facs="d202-03"/>NEIGHBORS IN FOSTERING AN
                            ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH STABILITY AND PROGRESS CAN FLOURISH.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT AND HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY VOICED THE HOPE THAT PAKISTAN AND
                            INDIA WOULD FIND WAYS TO REACH A JUST AND HONORABLE SETTLEMENT OF THE
                            EXISTING ISSUES. THEY NOTED WITH SATISFACTION THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY
                            BOTH COUNTRIES FOR MEETINGS WHICH HOLD THE PROMISE THROUGH FURTHER TALKS
                            OF PROGRESS TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN SOUTH ASIA BUILT ON LASTING
                            RELATIONSHIPS OF FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUAL RESPECT.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION FOR IRAN'S IMPRESSIVE RECORD IN
                            THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG ECONOMY AND THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF
                            HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S "WHITE REVOLUTION”. HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY OUTLINED
                            THE MAIN FEATURES OF IRAN'S NEW FIVE YEAR PLAN WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS
                            ON AGRO-INDUSTRY AND SOCIO ECONOMIC PROJECTS. THE PRESIDENT REITERATED
                            THE READINESS OF THE UNITED STATES TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN AS APPROPRIATE
                            IN THIS EXTENSIVE RPOGRAM AND IMPORTANT ENTERPRISE.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT AND HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY ALSO DISCUSSED THE WORLDWIDE
                            NARCOTICS PROBLEM. THEY NOTED THAT IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES WERE
                            TAKING VIGOROUS ACTION AGAINST THE ILLICIT INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS
                            TRAFFIC. BOTH TOOK SATISFACTION IN IRAN'S EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CONTROL
                            DOMESTIC OPIUM PRODUCTION. THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING OF
                            IRAN'S DECLARED POLICY TO CEASE INTERNAL CULTIVATION OF THE OPIUM POPPY
                            WHEN IRAN'S NEIGHBORS ALSO CEASE INTERNAL CULTIVATION OF THE OPIUM
                            POPPY. THEY AGREED THAT THE TWO GOVERNMENTS SHOULD CONTINUE THEIR CLOSE
                            COOPERATION IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS DEALING WITH NARCOTIC MATTERS. THE
                            PRESIDENT NOTED WITH APPRECIATION THE ACTIVE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IRAN AT
                            THE RECENT UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE WHICH ADOPTED A PROTOCOL AMENDING
                            THE 1961 SINGLE CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS. THE PRESIDENT REAFFIRMED
                            UNITED STATES' SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION IN SOLVING INTERNATIONAL
                            NARCOTICS PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED DEEP SATISFACTION OVER THE EXCELLENCE OF RELATIONS
                            BETWEEN THEIR TWO-COUNTRIES AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE
                            IN NE FUTURE. HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY STRESSED ONCE AGAIN IRAN'S
                            DETERMINATION TO STRENGTHEN ITS DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY TO ENSURE-THE
                            NATION'S SECURITY. THE PRESIDENT CONFIRMED THAT THE <pb n="4" xml:id="d202-04" facs="d202-04"/>UNITED STATES WOULD, AS IN THE
                            PAST, CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN IN STRENGTHENING ITS DEFENSES.
                            THEY REAFFIRMED THEIR RESPECT FOR THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT OF EVERY NATIONAL
                            TO CHOOSE ITS OWN DESTINY IN ITS OWN WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE
                            INTERFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>IN EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR THE WARM HOSPITALITY SHOWN HIM AND MRS.

                        <p rend="center">IRAN: INTERNAL DISSIDENCE - A NOTE OF WARNING</p>
                        <p>The bombings in Tehran during President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit highlight the existence of internal
                            dissidence in Iran. In itself, such dissidence is nothing new. For many
                            years it did not pose a serious problem for SAVAK, the Iranian National
                            Security and Intelligence organization. However, dissident activities
                            over the past two years show that a violence- inclined "youth
                            underground" has taken root in Iran with possibly serious consequences
                            for the country's long-term stability.</p>
                        <p>In public, the Government of Iran prefers to blame outside instigation
                            for domestic dissidence. The available intelligence indicates that
                            SAVAK, however, knows there is more to the problem than that. While many
                            Iranian dissidents are linked clearly to the radical regime in Iraq or
                            to other organizations and movements outside Iran, even the intelligence
                            information received directly from official Iranian sources indicates
                            that Iran now has its own indigenous "alienated youth" movement. The
                            activities of persons in this movement, including bombings, attacks on
                            police, assassinations, bank robberies, kidnappings (so far unsuccess-
                            ful), and shootouts with security forces, are part of a pattern that has
                            become familiar elsewhere in the world. <pb n="2" xml:id="d203-02" facs="d203-02"/>Intelligence reports on arrests and interrogations,
                            with public and private statements by SAVAK and the Iranian police,
                            indicate that, at a minimum, several hundred, mainly middle-class,
                            Iranian young people, educated overseas or at home, are sufficiently
                            alienated from their government and society to accept the hardships of
                            longterm clandestinity and personal danger in pursuit of radical change,
                            frequently no more than "revolution for the sake of the revolution.” Few
                            of them seem to have a clear concept of what is to replace the present
                            social order in Iran, though most are more or less leftist and claim
                            some title to being Marxist, Marxist-Leninist, or Maoist. The dissidents
                            have no single overall organization. Though identifiable small groups
                            sometimes appear to overlap or maintain occasional liaison with one
                            another, uncovering, penetrating, and rolling up their networks is a
                            constantly renewed task for SAVAK since new groups are always springing
                            up among the students and recent university graduates in Iran.</p>
                        <p>Though rightly deemed no immediate threat to the general security of the
                            Iranian state, these groups still pose a threat greatly in excess of
                            their numbers. The current political stability and orderly economic
                            development of Iran depend overwhelmingly for their continuation on one
                            man, the Shah. The Shah's sudden death by any means would be a setback
                            to the continued implementation of the basically evolutionary political,
                            social, and economic reforms of his "White Revolution.” It would remove
                            the ruler's will, dynamism, sense of direction, and authority which have
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d203-03" facs="d203-03"/>spurred Iran's rapid
                            emergence as a strong pro-Western regional power. The Shah's death at
                            the hands of an assassin would create an atmosphere of suspicion and
                            insecurity exploitable by Iran's dissidents even if an individual not
                            connected with the movement did the act. In the short run, popular
                            revulsion at the killing of the ruler could facilitate the immediate
                            task of the Shah's successors and help to legitimize firm security
                            measures. The law of succession in Iran calls for the Empress to act as
                            Regent for the Crown Prince Reza during his minority (he is now 11 years
                            old). The Empress Farah is genuinely popular in Iran, and in the
                            immediate aftermath of her husband's assassination could be expected to
                            carry through a relatively smooth transfer of power, while SAVAK and the
                            armed forces guaranteed public order. In the longer run, however, the
                            lack of broadly-based political institutions, the absence of the Shah's
                            firm hand, a likely atmosphere of doubt and fear fuelled by increased
                            dissident activities and perhaps also by excessive security measures,
                            could undermine public confidence and impair the country's reputation as
                            a stable and modernizing nation.</p>
                        <p>There is no reliable evidence that Iranian dissident groups or
                            individuals as yet have focussed on the Shah as a target. It must be
                            expected, however, to occur to them as the toll of arrests and
                            executions demonstrates the futility of "armed propaganda" against a
                            regime with the Shah's resources. The Shah is a difficult target to hit,
                            but no man is invulnerable. <pb n="4" xml:id="d203-04" facs="d203-04"/>Iran's home-grown dissidents are concerned almost exclusively with
                            domestic issues in their anti-regime activity. To a young dissident with
                            the anarchistic outlook of the "New Left,” the level of disruption and
                            uncertainty that the killing of the Shah would generate represents a
                            positive gain. He would expect to see a weaker, probably clumsier
                            successor regime, one sufficiently frightened to inaugurate its rule
                            with a crackdown on internal disorder but unable in the long run to
                            maintain concentrated pressure on internal dissidents. He might even see
                            opportunities in such a situation for gaining a measure of popular
                            support for a genuine revolution in Iran, a support he has been prepared
                            to do without since it has been largely unobtainable from a population
                            convinced that the Shah holds all the cards.</p>
                        <p>The apparently self-renewing proliferation of dissident "cells" and
                            reported attempts to re-establish guerrilla outposts in the mountains of
                            rural northern Iran indicate the potential for something more than
                            hit-or-miss urban terrorism in the future. A question of some relevance
                            now is when Iran's dissidents will raise their sights high enough to
                            pass from "guerrilla theater" to attempt a decisive act which could have
                            repercussions far beyond Iran's borders.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>When we were in Tehran, you agreed that it would be desirable to record
                            as instructions for the bureaucracy those specific commitments which the
                            President made to the Shah on provision of military equipment so we can
                            establish the basis for follow-up. A memorandum is attached [Tab A] for
                            this purpose.</p>
                        <p>In reading my formulation, you will want to bear in mind (a) the
                            practical limitations which we face in providing some of this equipment
                            and (b) the rather free interpretation the Shah is making of the
                            President's promises [Tab B]. In my memo, I have tried to convey the
                            President's commitment while giving Defense latitude to deal with some
                            of its problems. Specifically:</p>
                        <p>1. On the F-14 and F-15 aircraft, Defense feels our own units should have
                            preference on delivery and also wants to avoid what happened when we
                            committed the F-111 to Australia before full operational testing. I
                            should think we could handle this, having committed ourselves in
                            principle, by keeping the Shah posted at each major milestone in the
                            testing and production so we can agree on the time when it would be
                            appropriate for Iran to place its order.</p>
                        <p>2. On the laser-guided bombs, the Shah feels the President promised to
                            provide "all available sophisticated weapons short of the atomic bomb.”
                            The laser-guided bombs, of course, represent very advanced technology
                            which we would not want compromised. In any case, our forces in
                            Southeast Asia are using our full production at the moment. Defense may
                            come back with one of two responses: either a timetable for delivery
                            after our Vietnam needs have peaked or the suggestion to provide "smart
                            bombs" short of the laser-guided bombs until they are available.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d204-02" facs="d204-02"/>
                        <p>3. On the "blue-suiters,” the Shah is saying that the President promised
                            "any number that is needed in Iran"—this, in the context of the Shah's
                            remark that the Soviets have 10-20,000 technicians in Egypt. The
                            Pentagon will have to find a way to cope with a legislative limit on the
                            numbers of such people that we have stationed overseas. It may be
                            possible to deal with them outside the normal <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> framework, but as you know the provision of "advisers"
                            has a sticky history with the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The memo at Tab A asks the Pentagon, coordinating with State, to come
                            back by June 30 with a timetable and method for carrying out these
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>Two other questions relating to follow-up:</p>
                        <p>—Was there any discussion of our Persian Gulf naval force and did the
                            President promise to<lb/> re-study it?<lb/> enlarge it?<lb/> reduce
                            it?<lb/> withdraw it? no discussion<lb/>
                        </p>
                        <p>—Did the Shah urge the US to take more Iranian oil?<lb/> Yes<lb/> No<lb/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you sign the memorandum at Tab A if you feel it
                            captures the main elements in the President's commitment.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1.MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAMSON HAD ONE AND ONE-HALF HOUR AUDIENCE WITH HIS
                            IMPERIAL MAJESTY ON 5 JUN 72. THIS IS THE FIRST AUDIENCE THAT WAS AT THE
                            REQUEST OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY AS OPPOSED TO MY REQUEST.</p>
                        <p>2.HIM ASKED ABOUT BRIGADIER GENERAL PRICE'S CONDITION AND EXPRESSED HIS
                            EXTREME REGRET FOR THE BOMBING INCIDENT. HE STATED ALTHOUGH HIS COUNTRY
                            HAS RELATIVELY FEW DISSIDENT INDIVIDUALS, IT APPEARS THAT EVERY COUNTRY
                            HAS A FEW SICK MINDS THAT CAN ONLY BE SATISFIED THROUGH VIOLENCE. HE
                            STATED THAT THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND THE SOCIAL REFORMS THAT ARE BEING
                            IMPLEMENTED APPEAR TO BE ADEQUATE FOR MOST ALL THINKING PEOPLE, HOWEVER,
                            IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETELEY STAMP OUT VIOLENCE.</p>
                        <p>3. HIM STATED HIS COMPLETE SATISFACTION WITH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>'S VISIT AND EXPRESSED THE THOUGHT
                            THAT IT WAS A GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST TO THIS PART OF THE WORLD AS
                            WELL AS A PRACTICAL RECOGNITION OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OVER HERE. HIM
                            STATED THAT HE FELT THAT HE RECEIVED TWO MAJOR UNDERSTANDINGS FROM THE
                            PRESIDENT. FIRST, IRAN WILL GET ALL AVAILABLE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS
                            SHORT OF THE ATOMIC BOMBS. SECOND, THE UNITED STATES WILL PROVIDE THE
                            NECESSARY TECHNICIANS AND ADVISORS TO PERMIT IRAN TO ADVANCE ITS ARMED
                            FORCES <pb n="4" xml:id="d204-04" facs="d204-04"/>AS RAPIDLY AS
                            POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>4. HIM STATED THAT HE SPECIFICALLY AVOIDED IDENTIFYING A NUMBER OF
                            TECHNICIANS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD FURNISH, HOWEVER, HE DID
                            MENTION THAT THE USSR HAS PLACED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000
                            TECHNICIANS IN EGYPT. AFTER HIM MENTIONED THIS NUMBER, THE PRESIDENT IS
                            REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THAT THE U.S. WILL FURNISH ANY NUMBER THAT IS
                            NEEDED IN IRAN.</p>
                        <p>5. HIM EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE THIRTY-SIX ADDITIONAL SPACES
                            THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED ' FOR ARMISH/MAAG AND ASKED IF THERE WAS A
                            LEGAL LIMIT TO THE SIZE OF THE MAAG. I EXPLAINED THE CONGRESSIONAL
                            ACTIONS OF LAST JANUARY AND TOLD HIM THAT, IN MY JUDGMENT, THE MAAG, AS
                            IT FURNISHES TOP-LEVEL ADVISORS, IS PROBABLY STILL NEEDED. WE AGREED
                            THAT THE MAJOR REQUIREMENT AT THIS TIME IS MIDDLE MANAGERS AND
                            TECHNICIANS, AS PERSONIFIED BY THE TAFT TEAM APPROACH. IT WAS AGREED
                            THAT MAJOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE IMPROVED HAWK MISSILE SYSTEM, GROUND
                            FORCES AVIATION, AERIAL REFUELERS, ETC., WOULD BE THE YARDSTICKS BY
                            WHICH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICIANS WOULD BE MEASURED.</p>
                        <p>6. I EXPLAINED THE LATEST INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPROVED HAWK
                            MISSILE, SHOWING TENTATIVE DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND FORMAL TRAININ
                            REQUIRED TECHNICIANS. IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MAIN TIME-SAVING APPROACH
                            ON THE PART OF THE IRANIANS WOULD BE SELECTION OF QUALIFIED
                            ENGLISH-SPEAKING PERSONS FOR THE TRAINING PROGRAMS. AT THIS TIME, HIM
                            STATED THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER TRANSFERRING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL FROM THE
                            OTHER SERVICES INTO THE AIR FORCE IF NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE THE TIME OF
                            OPERATIONAL READINESS.</p>
                        <p>7. HIM EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN REGARDING THE U.S. NVY STANDARD MISSILE.
                            SEVERAL COUNTRIES' REPRESENTATIVES, SPECIFICALLY BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND
                            BELGIUM, HAVE RECENTLY INDICATED THAT THEIR COUNTRIES EXTENT THEY ARE
                            USING AS THEIR BASIS A REUTERS RELEASE OF A G.A.O. REPORT OUT OF
                            WASHINGTON, DATED 4 APR 72. THIS REPORT STATES THAT THE UNITED STATES
                            HAS SPENT OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS DEVELOPING THE U.S NAVY STANDARD
                            MISSILE AND HAS NOT YET SUCCEEDEDQ. IN FACT, THE REPORT STATES THAT
                            [UNCLEAR] STANDARD MISSILE IS EXPERIENCING A DECREASE IN EFFECTIVENESS.
                            I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH SOME GAO REPORTS ARE
                            SUBMITTED AND COVERED THE FACT THAT OFTEN THESE REPORTS ARE SUBMITTED
                            AND STATED IN A MANNER DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO AVOID FUTURE MISTAKES. WE
                            COVERED THE DANGER OF TAKING A DEROGATORY REPORT OUT OF CONTEXT BEFORE
                            THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN DULY INVESTIGATED. I EXPLAINED THE RATIONALE
                            BEHIND THE STANDARD MISSILE, WHICH HIM APPEARED TO ACCEPT QUITE READILY.
                            (AS A MATTER OF INFORMATION, GENERAL TOUFANIAN, THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF
                            WAR FOR ARMAMENTS, AND GENERAL AZHARI, THE CHIEF OF THE SUPREME
                            COMMANDER'S STAFF, <pb n="5" xml:id="d204-05" facs="d204-05"/>HAVE BOTH
                            MADE TRIPS TO EUROPE WITHIN THE LAST MONTH TO ATTEND DEMONSTRATIONS AND
                            RECEIVE SALES PITCHES. BOTH HAVE EXPRESSED THE THOUGHT THAT THEY PREFER
                            U.S. EQUIPMENT, HOWEVER, OTHER COUNTRIES ARE MAKING UNUSUALLY OPTIMISTIC
                            CLAIMS.</p>
                        <p>8. WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE, HIM AGAIN SPOKE FOR SOME
                            TIME, EXPLAINING HIS VIEWS OF THE SURROUNDING COPUTRIES. WITH REGARD TO
                            PAKISTAN, HIM AGAIN EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS QUITE FEARFUL THAT THE COUTNRY
                            WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD TOGETHER. HE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT PRESIDENT
                            BHUTTO, WHO IS VISITING HERE THIS WEEK, IS THE BEST THAT APPEARS TO BE
                            AVAILABLE AND CAN HOLD THE COUNTRY TOGETHER IF ANYONE CAN.</p>
                        <p>9. HIM DESCRIBED KUWAIT AS A REAL TRAGEDY OF THE DECADE, EXPLAINING THAT
                            HE WAS FEARFUL THAT KUWAIT WAS DEVELOPING INTO THE CATALYST THAT WOULD
                            SPREAD DIFFICULTIES THROUGHOUT THE AREA.</p>
                        <p>10. REGARDING IRAQ, HIM STATED THAT THE RECENT <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/IRAQI AGREEMENT HAS FORCED HIM TO CHANGE HIS VIEWS
                            WITH RESPECT TO THE MIDDLE EAST AREA. HE STATED THAT HIS INITIAL
                            OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET THE BRITISH OUT AND TO INSIST THAT NO OTHER MAJOR
                            POWER COME IN. SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/IRAQI PACT, HIM SAYS THAT HE IS COMPLETELY WILLING FOR
                            THE U.S. TO COME INTO THIS AREA IF IT WILL DO SO WITH QUALITY. HE
                            REPEATED THAT HE WAS THINKING OF QUALITY AND NOT QUANTITY, STATING THAT
                            A FEW CORVETTES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE. HE WOULD LIKE FOR US TO PUT ON
                            DISPLAY, IN THIS AREA, THE MOST MODERN PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE CAN.
                            HE DID NOT GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL.</p>
                        <p>11. MOVING FARTHER SOUTH, HIM EXPRESSED THE THOUGHT THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAD
                            MANY POSSIBILITIES, BUT IS PROGRESSIVELY BECOMING SURROUNDED BY
                            DISSIDENT ELEMENTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE IS MOST FEARFUL THAT THE
                            COUNTRY WILL BE UNDER FATAL CHALLENGE IN TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS.</p>
                        <p>12. REGARDING DISPOSITION OF MILITARY FORCES WITHIN THE COUNTRY OF IRAN,
                            HIM ONCE AGAIN COVERED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ADEQUATE GROUND FORCES
                            STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED TO ASSIST IN MAINTAINING STABILITY AND THE
                            DEVELOPMENT OF HIS COUNTRY. AT THIS TIME HE WAS SPECIFICALLY REFERRING
                            TO CHAH BAHAR AND ZAHEDAN. HE STATED THAT THE PUBLICATIONS COMING OUT OF
                            IRAQ WERE SURPRISING AS THEY EXTENDED THE BALUCHISTAN AREA NORTH THROUGH
                            AFGHANISTAN. HOWEVER, THEY WERE EVEN MORE SHOCKING AS THEY MOVED THE
                            BORDER WEST OF SANDAR ABBAB. AS HIM DEPLOYS HIS ARMED FORCES IN THE
                            EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, HE STATED THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY ORGANIZE
                            ANOTHER ARMORED DIVISION TO COVER THE EXTREME EAST TO INCLUDE THE
                            ZAHEDAN AND CHAH BAHAR AREA AND THAT UTILIZING THE ADDITIONAL FIGHTER
                            SQUADRONS THAT HE HAS IN MIND AND REDUCING HIS CONCENTRATION AT VAHDATI,
                            HE CAN PLACE AICRAFT AT CHAH BAHAR AND KERMAN. (NO AIRCRAFT TO BE
                            PERMANENTLY STATIONED AT ZAHEDAN.) HIM STATED THAT HIS REFUELING
                            CAPABILITY WOULD PERMIT <pb n="6" xml:id="d204-06" facs="d204-06"/>HIM
                            TO COVER ZAHEDAN WITH AIRCRAFT COMING OUT OF KERMAN, SANDAR ABBASS, AND
                            CHAH BAHAR.</p>
                        <p>SECTION II OF II</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d204-07" facs="d204-07"/>
                        <p>13. HIM SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME DISCUSSING THE KHUZISTAN AREA AND THE
                            FACT THAT IT NOW REPRESENTS ALMOST A COMPLETE BALANCED SOCIETY. HE
                            STATED THAT ITS AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT IS NOW EQUAL TO ALL OF THE REST OF
                            THE COUNTRY AND THAT ITS STEEL, OIL, AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES MAKE
                            IT AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE AREA. HE IS CONTEMPLATING BUILDING A 200,000
                            BARREL PER DAY OIL REFINERY ON KHARG ISLAND. HE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT HE
                            BELIEVED IT ESSENTIAL THAT HE NOT RUN HIS NATURAL RESOURCES DRY IN A
                            PERIOD OF TWELVE YEARS, SUMMING UP WITH THE STATEMENT THAT HE IS
                            THINKING IN TERMS OF UTILIZING HIS OIL RESOURCES OVER A PERIOD OF AT
                            LEAST THIRTY YEARS. AT THAT TIME HE AGAIN COVERED THE FACT THAT JAPAN
                            AND EUROPE CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT OIL FROM THIS AREA AND THAT THE UNITED
                            STATES WOULD BE EXTREMELY HARD-PRESSED MAINTAIN ITS PRESENT PROJECTIONS.
                            HE STATED THAT HE FULLY SUPPORTS A DETENTE IN EUROPE, BUT IS QUITE
                            INSISTENT THAT IT NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN ISOLATION. HIS GREAT CONCERN IS
                            THAT THE OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST MAY BECOME
                            FRAGMENTED AND AT LEAST SOME OF THEIR OUTPUT BE DENIED THE WESTERN
                            WORLD.</p>
                        <p>14. HIM STATED THAT, IN HIS JUDGMENT, RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
                            AND IRAN WERE THE BEST THEY HAVE EVER BEEN AND THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT
                            THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE OUR CLOSE TIES.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>During the President's talks with the Shah of Iran in Tehran on May
                            30-31, the President was forthcoming in response to the Shah's general
                            request for continued US support in meeting Iran's needs for military
                            equipment. The President made the specific commitments described below
                            which now require follow-up:</p>
                        <p>1. The US is willing in principle to selll 17-14 and F-15 aircraft to
                            Iran as soon as we are satisfied as to their operational
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>2. The US is prepared to provide laser-guided bombs to Iran.</p>
                        <p>3. The US will assign in Iran an increased number of uniformed military
                            technicians from the US services in accordance with the so-called
                            "blue-suiter" approach to work with the Iranian services.</p>

                        <p>For HAK — Iranian Concern over US Bahrain Facility: The Iranian Foreign
                            Minister has expressed concern over recent Congressional actions on US
                            arrangements for our naval force at Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Senator Case is pressing an amendment to the Foreign
                            Assistance Act demanding that the Azores and Bahrain facilities, now
                            under executive agreements, be submitted to the Senate as treaties. Each
                            time there is a Congressional step on this, it receives media coverage
                            and arouses both Iranian and Bahraini concern. A few days ago, the
                            Senate voted down efforts by Sparkman to delete the amendment from the
                            bill, and it now goes to the House. There is still some chance it may
                            never get through.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian Foreign Minister told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> that Iran is concerned that if the Bahrain
                            executive agreement ever gets transformed into a bilateral treaty
                            between the US and Bahrain this would provide justification for the
                            Soviets to formalize a similar naval presence in Iraq. The Foreign
                            Minister expressed the hope we are taking the right tack with Congress
                            in making clear the Bahraini arrangement is not a new one. He added that
                            Iran values the MIDEASTFOR presence and hopes it will continue as long
                            as it can do so under present arrangements.</p>

                            UNCERTAINTY</p>
                        <p>The OPEC(1) Ordinary Ministerial Council Conference opened June 27 in
                            Vienna with important issues unresolved. The main issues facing the
                            conferees are: (1) OPEC failure to make any headway with the oil
                            companies on implementation of the 20 percent participation agreed to in
                            principle by the companies last March; (2) Iraq's nationalization of the
                            Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) on June 1;
                            and (3) Iran's agreement with the consortium of oil companies operating
                            in that country to extend the consortium's concession beyond the current
                            expiration date in 1979.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (1) OPEC members are: Abu Dhabi, Algeria, Indonesia, Iran,
                            Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Participation</p>
                        <p>OPEC won the first round in the participation negotiations when Aramco,
                            acting on behalf of all the major oil companies operating in the Persian
                            Gulf, agreed to the principle of 20 percent participation in company
                            operations by host countries. Since March OPEC and the oil companies
                            have not even been able to agree on the form participation will take -
                            stock in the company, share of oil production, and/or <pb n="2" xml:id="d207-02" facs="d207-02"/>share of the profits, not to
                            mention the more difficult matter of how much the companies should be
                            compensated for the loss of assets and future profits. Lack of progress
                            in negotiating details of participation will generate acrimonious debate
                            at the Conference. The minimum position the Conference seems likely to
                            agree to is one calling for immediate transfer of a 20 percent share of
                            oil pro- duction to host governments, a timetable for attainment of a
                            con- trolling interest, and deferring a decision on the thorny issue of
                            compensation.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> Expropriation</p>
                        <p>Two sobering realizations have been brought home by the Iraqi
                            expropriation of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Coming on the
                            heels of Libya's expropriation of <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s
                            holdings in that country and Algeria's seizure last year of majority
                            interest in French companies operating there, Iraq's action has made the
                            companies more acutely aware of how fragile the control they have over
                            their concessions has now become. On the other hand, Iraq's difficulties
                            in resuming oil exports from the expropriated fields - there have been
                            no exports from these fields since the expropriation - have once again
                            reminded producer countries of their dependence on the companies for
                            distributing the oil. (Libya has experienced similar difficulty in
                            marketing oil from the nationalized <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>
                            fields). <pb n="3" xml:id="d207-03" facs="d207-03"/>In initial
                            statements most OPEC member states promised to support Iraq's move
                            against <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> by not increasing oil
                            exports to make up for the reduction in flow from the former <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> held fields in northern Iraq and to
                            oppose any retaliatory actions taken by the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> shareholders(2) against Iraq. The Ministers at the
                            Conference will probably follow up this earlier action by issuing a
                            statement whose general thrust would be to support nationalization of
                            oil production whenever current owners fail to meet the "reasonable"
                            demands of host governments. A statement of this type would satisfy the
                            "radicals" and the "moderates" since "reasonable" means different things
                            to different countries and leaves them free to act according to their
                            own national interests.'</p>

                        <p>Iran has agreed to extend the Consortium's(3) exclusive production rights
                            in the "agreement area" fifteen years beyond the current ex- piration
                            date in 1979. In return for the extension the Consortium has agreed to
                            increase oil production from the current level of 4.3 million barrels
                            per day (b/d) to about 8 million b/d in 1976, turn over the large Abadan
                            refinery to the government for its use, build a new Consortium refinery
                            at Kharg Island, and provide crude oil to the National Iranian Oil
                            Company (NIOC) for Iranian domestic con- sumption and marketing abroad.
                            The agreement makes no provision and a group of smaller American
                            companies - the remaining 5%. <pb n="4" xml:id="d207-04" facs="d207-04"/>for participation by Iran in the Consortium's crude output, a point
                            that will be roundly criticized by other OPEC members at the Conference.
                            However, Iran owns the fixed assets in the "agreement area" and in
                            effect has achieved many participation objectives using a different
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (3) Shareholders in the Consortium are: <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> - 40%, Shell - 14%, <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss>
                            - 6%, Esso, Mobil, Gulf, Texaco, Socal - 7% each,</p>
                        <p>Iran is not alone in following a different approach to partici- pation.
                            Iraq's expropriation of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> is in effect
                            participation with a vengeance and certainly takes a long step ahead of
                            the plan for 20 percent participation now, with the understanding that
                            majority or full ownership would come after a period of phased
                            increments in participation. Nigeria has taken a slightly different tack
                            in insisting on an initial minimum 35 percent participation in its older
                            concessions (in new concessions Nigeria has retained a controlling
                            interest in production). Venezuela is apparently satisfied with its own
                            agreements that will give it control over virtually all oil production
                            in the country by 1983. Libya is demanding 51 percent participation in
                            current negotiations for production rights with the Italian national oil
                            firm, ENI. The picture that is developing is one of general OPEC
                            agreement on the principle of participation, while the form, payment
                            for, timing, and other critical details will be left to individual
                            countries to work out on a case by case basis in accordance with their
                            own interests.</p>

                        <p>While the different approaches to participation taken by various OPEC
                            members may signal incipient divergence in that group, the <pb n="5" xml:id="d207-05" facs="d207-05"/>important change in the
                            relationship between the companies and host governments has not served
                            to unite the consumer country governments vis-a-vis the producers. A
                            Dutch proposal that <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> governments
                            use their oil stockpiles to back up the companies in negotiations with
                            producer governments was sidestepped at the June 19 meeting of the
                            working group of the OECD Oil Committee and deferred to the group's next
                            meeting scheduled for November. Other consumer governments are less
                            interested in supporting the predominantly American, British, and Dutch
                            oil companies. As long as oil supplies do not appear seriously
                            threatened, consumer governments seem to prefer leaving the
                            participation matter to the companies to work out with OPEC. Whether a
                            supply crisis would lead consumer countries to form a united front
                            vis-a-vis the producing countries is not clear and is probably not a
                            choice that will have to be made in the near future.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Shah of Iran last week reached agreement with the members of the oil
                            consortium on a variety of measures to increase oil production in Iran,
                            to increase Iran's overall oil income, to increase Iran's direct
                            involvement in the petroleum operation and to extend the companies' role
                            in Iran for another fifteen years beyond 1979 with periodic review. The
                            negotiations were tough, but the main point from our vantage is that
                            these negotiations were conducted in a responsible way. In addition, the
                            Shah has taken a different direction from the other oil producing
                            nations, thus weakening the position of OPEC in its negotiations with
                            the oil companies.</p>
                        <p> KEN JAMIESON, Chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey, and chief
                            negotiator with the Shah suggested this to <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName>. This suggestion is supported both here and in
                            the State Department, that a message from you to the Shah commending the
                            manner in which these negotiations were carried out would be an
                            appropriate gesture. This would not require you to make any judgment on
                            the terms of the settlement but would simply follow up your discussion
                            with him on the necessity of preserving stability in the flow of oil by
                            letting the Shah know that you have noted his contribution.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: That you approve dispatch of the following message to the
                            Shah:</p>
                        <p>“It was with great satisfaction that I learned of the successful
                            conclusion of negotiations between your government and the oil
                            consortium member companies. Your efforts to establish a new <pb n="3" xml:id="d208-03" facs="d208-03"/>framework for your future relations
                            have been of great interest to me and I have been most impressed by the
                            seriousness of purpose and the pragmatic approach that have
                            characterized the attitudes and positions of both sides. I sincerely
                            hope that the mutual respect and confidence that both sides exhibited in
                            the negotiations will continue to characterize your relations and that
                            this agreement will be the basis for further cooperation to the mutual
                            benefit of all parties concerned. With warm personal regards.”</p>

                        <p>The purposes of your stop in Tehran are to demonstrate as the President's
                            visit did our continued view that Iran is an important contributor to
                            stability in the Middle East, to follow up on subjects only briefly
                            covered in the President's talks with the Shah and to continue the
                            ongoing general exchange of views with the Shah. You should be aware
                            that the President in asking the Shah to see you sent a telegram after
                            departing from Tehran saying that you would be prepared to discuss,
                            among other subjects, the security of Pakistan, the Gulf, oil, and the
                            Kurdish problem. The latter issue will be covered in a separate message.
                            The others are covered below in Section IV.</p>
                        <p>You will find the mood in Iran a mixture of pride and confidence on the
                            one hand and concern on the other.</p>
                        <p>The pride stems from Iran's achievements over the past decade,
                            particularly the progress of the Shah's extensive domestic reforms such
                            as land reform and Iran's increasing economic independence with a growth
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d209-02" facs="d209-02"/>rate above 10% yearly
                            over the past five years. The Shah and Minister of Finance Amouzegar
                            have negotiated steady increases in the revenues from oil, which are the
                            basis for Iran's progress, but they are energetically diversifying
                            against the day when the wells run dry. With this progress has come an
                            enhanced international status. Iran is a country to be reckoned with in
                            the regional context.</p>
                        <p>At the same time there is recognition that these rapid changes are
                            producing increasing internal dislocations and pressures against a
                            background of changes in the areas around Iran. This leads to anxiety on
                            two fronts: (a) The Shah is concerned that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may find ways to facilitate the overflow into Iran of
                            the instability that has developed in Pakistan, Iraq and Turkey. (b)
                            Coupled with this is concern that Iran's stability and progress are too
                            exclusively dependent on the Shah's firm personal leadership and that
                            institutions are not evolving that could make an orderly transition if
                            he were to pass from the scene. The Shah himself has voiced concern on
                            this point from time to time, although not in the President's recent
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The President's Talks with the Shah.</p>
                        <p>Based on the Shah's conversation with the President, you can expect the
                            following to be the main elements in the line the Shah will take with
                            you:</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d209-03" facs="d209-03"/>
                        <p>1. In the Shah's view, the situation in the Middle East, South Asia and
                            the Indian Ocean has changed markedly over the last year in ways that
                            increase the threat to the security of Iran.</p>
                        <p>2. He sees the Soviet friendship treaties with Egypt, India and Iraq
                            signed over the past year as evidence of serious changes which have
                            worked to Soviet advantage in the overall balance of forces in the
                            Middle East and South Asia since a year ago. While he does not oppose
                            East-West detente in Europe, he points out that this detente will pose
                            dangers for Iran in tempting the Soviets to feel more free to expand
                            into the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. Going hand-in-hand with this Soviet thrust, he sees an increasing
                            threat posed by situations on both sides of Iran. He is expanding his
                            military defenses so that they will cover Iran on all sides and not just
                            on the Soviet and Iraqi borders.</p>
                        <p>a. The Shah saw December's events in South Asia not only in terms of the
                            Soviets improving their position but with fear that further
                            disintegration in Pakistan could spill over into southeastern Iran
                            (Baluchistan). With this in mind, he urged the President to do
                            everything possible to help make Pakistan viable. He also regards
                            Afghanistan as vulnerable to the same kind of disintegration he fears in
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d209-04" facs="d209-04"/>
                        <p>b. While Iraq is inherently unstable, the Shah is concerned about the
                            subversive efforts of which Iraq is capable, especially in Kuwait, in
                            the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms, in Saudi Arabia and in Jordan.</p>
                        <p>4. These situations on his borders lead him to point out that it is
                            necessary for Iran to be able to defend itself. He described to the
                            President his needs in modernizing his military forces, and the
                            President made certain promises. Below, you will find a formulation for
                            addressing these commitments. He may also describe to you his current
                            efforts to find financing through private American banks and contractors
                            for a combination air and naval base which he would like to build at
                            Chah Bahar on the southern coast of Iran near the Pakistan border.
                            (Robert Ellsworth at Lazard Freres has been involved in trying to put
                            together a consortium for this purpose.)</p>
                        <p>5. He generally expressed the following concerns in the other countries
                            around him: He fears that Saudi Arabia is particularly vulnerable to
                            subversion because the King has not moved quickly enough with reform
                            programs. He has promised to help the Sultan of Oman who faces what the
                            Shah regards as a Communist supported insurgency on his borders. He
                            respects the King of Jordan. Despite his concern about the Saudis, he
                            has maintained a close relationship with both King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> and King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d209-05" facs="d209-05"/>
                        <p>6. The Shah in connection with his effort to build closer regional
                            associations has moved since the death of NASSER to build a closer
                            relationship with Egypt. Although he has been disappointed by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>'s actions in the
                            past few months and is concerned about his relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he has been generally impressed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> and would like to
                            help him get out from under the Soviet thumb.</p>
                        <p>7. The Shah recognizes the changes that are taking place in the economic
                            organization of the world. He sees major economic blocs emerging and
                            feels that the Middle East should organize itself to deal more
                            effectively with the principal world power blocs. He sees the need for
                            regional development in the Middle East and believes that he probably
                            has as good credentials as anyone for asserting some leadership in this
                            region. This is one subject which you might want to draw him out on. It
                            was not discussed in any detail during the President's talks, and we are
                            aware of his views mainly from others who have talked with him.</p>
                        <p>8. The Shah sees the above political situation as of particular concern
                            to the US and Western Europe. He is very much concerned over what would
                            happen to the US and Europe if radical trends in the Arab world created
                            a threat to the continued flow of oil.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d209-06" facs="d209-06"/>
                        <p>During the President's visit to Tehran, the President covered the
                            following ground: 1. He described the background and purpose of his
                            summit meetings in relation to developments last fall in South Asia and
                            this spring in Vietnam. He noted that he has no over-expectations about
                            what these meetings by themselves will achieve, important as they were.
                            The Soviets have not changed their overall objectives.</p>
                        <p>2. In response to the Shah's specific requests for modern weapons, the
                            President was forthcoming. Specifically, he committed us in principle to
                            sell F-14 and F-15 aircraft as soon as we are satisfied that these are
                            operationally effective; he agreed to provide laser-guided bombs; he
                            agreed to assign in Iran additional military technicians from the US
                            services to work with the Iranian services. (Since the President's
                            return to Washington, a memorandum has been sent to the Secretaries of
                            State and Defense asking Defense to develop a plan for following up on
                            these Presidential commitments. There will be difficulties connected
                            with some of these deliveries, but we will keep the Shah informed at
                            each stage of progress so that he will have a sense that there is
                            determination on our side to follow through on these commitments as soon
                            as physically practicable.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d209-07" facs="d209-07"/>
                        <p>3. The President spoke from a general US position of strong support for
                            regional cooperation and a closer relationship among Iran, Saudi Arabia
                            and Jordan in blunting the Soviet thrust.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Points for You to Stress.</p>
                        <p>In general, you will want to stress the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Since the President has already talked with the Shah about his summit
                            meetings, your conversations in Tehran will probably have less to do
                            with this than at any of your other stops. However, the President's
                            purposes at the summits will provide the framework for your general
                            discussion, and since the Shah has heard the President himself on the
                            subject you start from common ground. It is still worth repeating the
                            fact, which the Shah will understand, that the US wants to establish a
                            framework of relationships between the nuclear powers which will permit
                            regional powers like Iran to play the principal role in contributing to
                            stability in their areas. Contrary to the view sometimes put forward by
                            the uninformed, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            Doctrine is not a formula for US withdrawal from the world. It is just
                            the opposite. It is designed to assure a strong and postive American
                            role. We are seeking to establish a framework for greater cooperation
                            with our allies in meeting our mutual security interests. We share a
                            common interest in a strong and secure Iran.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d209-08" facs="d209-08"/>
                        <p>2. Within this framework, we want the Shah to understand that we are
                            alert to the attention that the Soviet Union is giving to the area from
                            Egypt through India and we want to encourage the Shah's efforts to knit
                            a close regional association with those nations in his area that want to
                            resist the Soviet pressures. We want to encourage the Shah in his
                            special associations with Israel and Turkey, with Kings <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> and
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> and with President <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName> of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>3. Within the framework of discussing regional cooperation, you may wish
                            to tell him the President in his conversations with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in Washington in April
                            encouraged King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to play a
                            constructive role in helping provide the basis for stability in the
                            Persian Gulf in cooperation with Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
                        <p>4. Since you will just have come from South Asia, the Shah will be
                            intensely interested in your talks there. The main points to make are
                            our continued support for Pakistan and Bangladesh and our desire to put
                            our relationship with India on a sound basis.</p>
                        <p>5. The question of oil relationships will probably come up. There are two
                            aspects to the problem: (1) The near term aspect is that the Shah has
                            recently concluded an agreement with the Western oil consortium which is
                            tough but responsible. (2) The broader context, of course, is that the
                            US as well as Western Europe will become increasingly <pb n="9" xml:id="d209-09" facs="d209-09"/>dependent on Middle East oil over
                            the coming decade. The main point we want to make is to emphasize the
                            need for responsible negotiations such as those just concluded by the
                            Shah — as relationships between the producing countries and the
                            companies change.</p>
                        <p>6. Since the subject did not come up during the President's
                            conversations, it may be worth your mentioning the President's vigorous
                            campaign on the narcotics problem. In some ways, Iran shares our part of
                            the problem. Iran stopped production in the middle 1950s but then was
                            the victim of imports from Afghanistan and Turkey. At that point, Iran
                            tried to close its borders and began producing enough opium again to
                            meet the needs of its own addict population. We are not at the point of
                            being able to propose a regional attack on the narcotics problem, but
                            you might want to mention the President's concern about this problem to
                            the Shah and the US desire to cooperate with him and others in the
                            region in attacking it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Specific Issues.</p>
                        <p>On the specific issues which the President has mentioned to the Shah that
                            you might talk about, the following are the positions that you might
                            take:</p>
                        <p>1. The Security of Pakistan. Perhaps a good take-off point for your
                            conversation would be for you to give the Shah your impressions on South
                            Asia, since this is an area of primary concern to him. You can <pb n="10" xml:id="d209-10" facs="d209-10"/>reassure the Shah, as the
                            President did, that the US will continue to provide economic support for
                            Pakistan. The President and the Shah discussed the difficulty the US
                            faces in trying to supply the Shah with military equipment. There was
                            some discussion of whether Iran could be a channel for US military
                            equipment not provided directly to Pakistan, and in the President's
                            conversation with the Shah it was noted that there are legal
                            complications stemming from our Foreign Assistance Act which make this
                            impossible for us at the moment. It was left up in the air in the
                            President's conversation with the Shah that this would be an important
                            item and that we would have to address it later.</p>
                        <p>2. The Persian Gulf. The Shah can be encouraged to talk in greater detail
                            about how he sees the security situation in the Sultanate of Oman and in
                            the new Union of Arab Emirates at the lower end of the Persian Gulf. One
                            new element in this situation is the fact that the Jordanians have shown
                            as interest in playing a constructive role in the Gulf states, and they
                            have been encouraged by King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">FAISAL</persName> to do so. The President did not really have a
                            chance to discuss Jordan's role in any detail with the Shah, and it
                            might be well for you to let the Shah know that the President has given
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> his encouragement, provided anything
                            Jordan does is done in coordination with Saudi Arabia and Iran. The
                            President intimated in his discussions that we would make every effort
                            to meet King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s
                            requirements for military assistance.</p>
                        <p>3. Oil. The Shah will be concerned about the nationalization of the Iraq
                            petroleum company and about the generally increasing dependence of the
                                <pb n="11" xml:id="d209-11" facs="d209-11"/>Western world on Persian
                            Gulf oil. Since you have spoken to this problem yourself, you may want
                            to get the Shah's general views on it. In addition, the Shah from time
                            to time has pressed for special access to the US market. This interest
                            has decreased recently, but if it comes up again, you will have to
                            explain the political difficulties involved in altering our import
                            system.</p>

                                Iran</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>During your talks with the Shah on May 30-31, you made the following
                            specific commitments:</p>
                        <p>1. The US is willing in principle to sell F-14 and F-15 aircraft to Iran
                            as soon as we are satisfied as to their operational effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>2. The US is prepared to provide laser-guided bombs.</p>
                        <p>3. The US will assign in Iran an increased number of uniformed military
                            technicians from the US services to work with the Iranian services.</p>
                        <p>The Defense Department was asked to come up with a course of action for
                            following up on these promises which would take account of the state of
                            availability and testing on our side and the desirability of following
                            up as promptly as possible with the Shah. Based on their
                            recommendations, the following course of action on each item is
                            recommended:</p>
                        <p>1. F-14 and F-15 aircraft. Briefings would be offered to Iran by service
                            teams on the capabilities of these aircraft and on training and
                            logistics requirements associated with them. In order to allow
                            sufficient grounds for comparison of the two aircraft initial briefings
                            will be supplemented by appropriately spaced progress reports by service
                            teams as each aircraft moves toward the operationally effective stage.
                            The Defense Department recommends that "any Iranian decision should be
                            delayed until adequate operational experience has been acquired on both
                            aircraft. " The F-14 will be in operational units in early 1973, but the
                            F-15 not until mid-1975, so the Defense position would delay decision
                            until 1975. I would modify that to leave the decision to the Iranians in
                            the light of the briefings that are provided with the understanding that
                            we will want to be confident of the operational soundness of any plane
                            we sell.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d210-02" facs="d210-02"/>
                        <p>2. Laser-guided bombs. Briefings would be offered soon by a US Air Force
                            team. Weapons deliveries could commence seven months after those
                            briefings if the Iranians wish to place a formal order.</p>
                        <p>3. Uniformed technicians. These are the so-called "blue-suiters" the Shah
                            asked for—the technicians from our uniformed services to work with the
                            Iranian military. The Defense Department says that it will work out
                            detailed requirements with our military advisory group in Iran and then
                            work out the composition of teams, terms of reference and costs with the
                            Iranians.</p>

                            reflects the course of action described above.</p>

                        <p>Secretary Connally talked with the Shah for about three hours. They
                            apparently covered much of the same ground that you did. Some of the
                            most interesting points which the Shah made were:</p>
                        <p>—He would not be able to sustain his recent agreement with the oil
                            companies if they caved in to the demands of the Arab producers. He felt
                            that he had taken a reasonable and responsible approach to the oil issue
                            and should not be penalized for doing so.</p>
                        <p>—He expressed at length his concerns about the entire Persian Gulf area.
                            In particular, he indicated his concern over the lack of social and
                            economic progress in Saudi Arabia, Soviet influence in Iraq and the
                            Kurds.</p>
                        <p>—He asked again about his request to you for F-15s, "smart" bombs, and
                            training slots. [A separate memo deals with final guidance for following
                            up on your commitments.]</p>
                        <p>TALKING POINTS</p>
                        <p>1. Ask the Secretary what he thinks might be the best general approach to
                            take on the oil negotiations with the Arabs. What else, if anything, can
                            be done to encourage both sides to take a responsible approach to these
                            problems? What, if any, should the U.S. official role be in these
                            negotiations?</p>
                        <p>2. You might elicit the Secretary's thoughts or the role he thinks we
                            should be playing in the Persian Gulf area.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> has sent you
                            the message at Tab B. In it he notes that British, French and Italian
                            arms salesmen are putting the hard sell on the Iranian armed forces and
                            are encountering increasing receptivity. He says that his <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief has hesitated to push US
                            weapons—which the Iranians would prefer—since there is a point of view
                            "in certain echelons of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to the
                            effect that we should do what is possible to prevent Iran, in our
                            studied wisdom, from overbuying.” <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> says his view is that "as long as Iran can
                            financially afford both guns and butter there is no reason for us to
                            lose the market, particularly when viewed over the red ink on our
                            balance of payments ledger.” He asks for your guidance and says that his
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> chief will be instructed
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The message I propose in reply [Tab A] quite simply states that we should
                            leave decisions on what to buy to the Government of Iran and confine
                            ourselves to assuring that the Iranian Government has good technical
                            advice from our military people on the capabilities of the equipment
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>You are separately receiving a decision memorandum on the items which the
                            President promised to the Shah when he was in Tehran. I have included
                            the above guidance in the decision memorandum in that package as well.
                            Therefore, you can reply to <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> both by telling him what our position is and by
                            saying that this position will be confirmed by a Presidential directive
                            here in the next few days.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the question of U. S. arms sales in Iran, the President's
                            policy is to encourage purchase of U.S. equipment. Decisions as to
                            desirability of equipment acquisition should be left in the hands of the
                            Iranian Government and the U. S. should not undertake to discourage on
                            economic grounds. The U.S. should offer technical advice on the
                            capabilities of the equipment in question. If the Government of Iran has
                            decided to buy certain equipment, no restrictions other than the normal
                            licensing and legal requirements should be placed on U.S. firms which
                            are prepared to supply it, and normal Embassy facilitative services
                            should.be made available.</p>
                        <p>This general principle will be confirmed here in a Presidential directive
                            in the next few days when instructions are issued in connection with the
                            specific items that the President promised the Shah when he was in
                            Tehran. You will receive instructions on those through normal channels
                            as soon as the directive is issued. Warm regards.</p>

                        <p>GENERAL WILLIAMSON, CHIEF, ARMISH/MAAG, HAS INFORMED ME ENGLAND, FRANCE
                            AND ITALY ARE PUTTING HARD SELL ON IRANIAN ARMED FORCES AND ARE
                            ENCOUNTERING INCREASING RECEPTIVITY. WILLIAMSON FURTHER ADVISED THAT
                            IRANIAN ARMED FORCES WOULD PREFER US EQUIPMENT, I.E. 200 M60 TANKS,
                            MAVERICK AND HAWK MISSILES, LIGHT VEHICLES, ETC. SUM INVOLVED IN EXCESS
                            OF $250 MILLION. WILLIAMSON HAS HESITATED TO PUSH US ARMAMENT SALES
                            SINCE THERE IS DEFINITELY A POINT OF VIEW IN CERTAIN ECHELONS <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO EFFECT THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT WHICH
                            IS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT IRAN, IN OUR STUDIED WISDOM, FROM OVERBUYING. I
                            HEARD THIS POSITION VOICED EXTENSIVELY BY <persName corresp="#p_NJH1">JAMES H. NOYES</persName>, DEPUTY ASST. SECRETARY DOD, ON MAY 11
                            LAST. FURTHER, IT WAS THIS STANCE WHICH ACTIVATED THE RECENT SALE OF 800
                            CHIEFTAIN TANKS BY ENGLAND TO IRAN SINCE IRAN BELIEVED US POSTURE ON
                            TANK PURCHASE WOULD BE NEGATIVE. MY VIEW IS THAT AS LONG AS IRAN CAN
                            FINANCIALLY AFFORD BOTH GUNS AND BUTTER THERE IS NO REASON FOR US TO
                            LOSE THE MARKET, PARTICULARLY WHEN VIEWED OVER THE RED INK ON OUR
                            BALANCE OF PAYMENTS LEDGER. WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR GUIDANCE AND

                            REVIEWED PROBLEMS OF AREA, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON DANGERS SAME AS
                            AFFECTING IRAN. SECRETARY CONNALLY, IN TURN, VOICED HIS OBSERVATIONS
                            DERIVED FROM VISITS TO DACCA, NEW DELHI AND ISLAMABAD, AMONGST OTHER

                        <p>END SUMMARY. </p>
                        <p>2. SECRETARY CONNALLY AND I MET WITH HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY IN SAADABAD
                            PALACE AT 1300 HRS. ON JULY 8. THE CONVERSATION WHICH ENSUED LASTED FOR
                            A LITTLE OVER TWO HOURS, FOLLOWED BY A LEISURELY LUNCHEON. FOREIGN
                            MINISTER KHALATBARY AND FIANCE MINISTER AMUZEGAR JOINED IN THE AUDIENCE
                            TOWARD THE END OF THE INITIAL CONVERSATION AND ALSO WERE GUESTS AT THE
                            AFOREMENTIONED LUNCHEON THAT FOLLOWED.</p>
                        <p>3. HIM INITIATED THE CONVERSATION BY EXPRESSING HIS APPRECIATION FOR
                            SECRETARY CONNALLY'S VISIT AND NOTED HIS BELIEF THAT THE SECRETARY'S
                            PRESENCE, COMING AS A SPECIAL ENVOY OF PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>, COMPLEMENTED THE <pb n="2" xml:id="d213-02" facs="d213-02"/>PRESIDENT'S, STATE VISIT MAY 30-31.
                            HIM THEREUPON SUGGESTED TO SECRETARY CONNALLY THAT IT MIGHT SERVE A
                            USEFUL PURPOSE IF HE (HIM) UNDERTOOK A REVIEW OF THE PROBLEMS EXTANT IN
                            LFE NEAR EAST, INCLUDING THE RIPARIAN AREAS OF THE GULF, AND HIS
                            CRITICAL CONCERNS WHICH AROSE THEREFROM. THE SHAH THEREUPON FOR A PERIOD
                            OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR STEERED THE CONVERSATION THROUGH A CATHOLIC
                            TOUR D'HORIZON TOUCHING ON THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            IRAQ, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, BAHRAIN, THE UAE, PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.
                            THE COMMENTS OF THE SHAH WERE IN ALL RESPECTS IN KEEPING WITH THOSE HE
                            HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND HERETOFORE REPORTED IN
                            DEPTH. FROM AN INTELLIGENCE STANDPOINT NOTHING NEW EMERGED EXCEPT THE
                            FURTHER REAFFIRMATION OF THE SHAH'S CONCERN FOR WHAT HE TERMS "MAJOR
                            THREATS" TO THE SECURITY OF IRAN AND HIS DESIRED MILITARY REQUIREMENTS
                            TO BALANCE THE SAME. IN THE COURSE OF HIS CONVERSATION, HOWEVER, HE DID
                            DISCLOSE:</p>
                        <p>(A) THAT <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> HAD INVITED HIM FOR A
                            STATE VISIT DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER; HE DID NOT DISCLOSE, HOWEVER,
                            WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD ACCEPTED, AND </p>
                        <p>(B) THAT THE EMPRESS WOULD VISIT CHINA IN LATE SEPTEMBER. (THIS HAS BEEN
                            REPORTED BY SEPTEL.)</p>
                        <p>4. SECRETARY CONNALLY REITERATED THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED BY PRESIDENT
                            NIXON DURING THE STATE VISIT AND VOICED HIS OWN APPRECIATION FOR THE
                            PRESENTLY AFFORDED AUDIENCE WITH HIM AFTER APPROPRIATE COMMENTS ON THE
                            MATTERS LENGTHILY DISCUSSED BY HIM, THE SECRETARY SUGGESTED THAT IT
                            MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR THE SHAH'S ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS
                            OF THE SUBCONTINENT TO MAKE NOTE OF CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS DERIVED FROM
                            HIS RECENT STOPS IN DACCA, NEW DELHI AND ISLAMABAD. (THE SUBJECTS
                            DISCUSSED WITH SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN. INDIRA GANDHI AND ZULFIKAR ALI
                            BHUTTO HAVE BEEN REPORTED SEPARATELY.) IN ESSENCE THE THRUST OF THE
                            CONVERSATION WAS THAT THE SECRETARY FELT GUARDED OPTIMISM BOTH FOR THE
                            FUTURE OF BANGLADESH AND FOR THE HOPE OF PEACE IN THE SUBCONTINENT AS AN
                            OUTGROWTH OF THE SIMLA ACCORD.</p>
                        <p>5. AT THIS JUNCTURE I MADE MENTION OF THE FACT THAT I HAD BEEN PLEASED TO
                            CONVEY TO HIM THE LETTER FROM PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> WHICH EXPRESSED APPROBATION FOR THE MANNER AND
                            RESULT OF THE RECENT ACCORD WHICH HAD BEEN WORKED OUT BETWEEN <pb n="3" xml:id="d213-03" facs="d213-03"/>HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT AND THE
                            OIL CONSORTIUM (STATE 120017). THE SHAH ACKNOWLEDGED THE VALUE WHICH HE
                            ATTACHED TO THE RECEIPT OF THIS COMMUNICATION AND THE THOUGHTFULNESS
                            WHICH PROMPTED IT. HE SAID, HOWEVER, THAT AS OF AN HOUR BEFORE OUR
                            ARRIVAL HE HAD RECEIVED CERTAIN DISCOURAGING AND DISTRESSING INFORMATION
                            FROM MINISTER AMUZEGAR AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE FOR US TO HEAR
                            DIRECTLY FROM AMUZEGAR WHAT HAD BEEN TOLD TO HIM HERETOFOR. THE FOREIGN
                            MINISTER AND FINANCE MINISTER JOINED THE GROUP AND THE CONVERSATION
                            CONTINUED, CONCLUDING WITH LUNCHEON. MINISTER AMUZEGAR STATED THAT HE
                            HAD TALKED TO PRINCE SAUD THAT MORNING AND HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT ARAMCO
                            HAD OFFERED YAMANI AND THE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> GULF
                            GROUP SETTLEMENTS ON A NUMBER OF POINTS INVOLVED IN PARTICIPATION WHICH
                            WERE CONSIDERABLY MORE GENEROUS THAN THOSE ON THE SAME POINTS IN THE
                            FORTHCOMING <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>/CONSORTIUM AGREEMENT.
                            BEFORE THE MINISTER COULD BEGIN A DESCRIPTION OF THESE DIFFERENCES, THE
                            SHAH INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE COMPANIES WOULD DO
                            THIS. HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED, THIS IS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN BECAUSE,
                            ALTHOUGH IRAN'S INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED BY MOST FAVORED NATION
                            ARRANGMENTS WITH THE CONSORTIUM, SHOULD ARAMCO YIELD TO THE ARABS'
                            INTRANSIGENCE THIS COULD MAKE THEIR TACTICS SEEM MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE
                            MODERATION AND REASONED NEGOTIATION WHOSE APPARENT SUCCESS AT ST. MORITZ
                            HAD ENCHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SHAH'S LEADERSHIP OF THE PRODUCING
                            NATIONS AS PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> HAD
                            ACKNOWLEDGED. UNDERMINING THE SHAH AS A SYMBOL OF THE SUCCESSFULNESS OF
                            REASON AND COOPERATION BETWEEN PRODUCING NATIONS AND COMPANIES WOULD
                            ENCOURAGE THE IRRESPONSIBLE RADICALS IN <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. THE SECRETARY AND I BOTH TOLD HIM THAT WE HAD NO
                            INDICATION THAT ARAMCO HAD DONE ANYTHING OF THE SORT. THE SHAH THEN
                            DIRECTED THE MINISTER OF FINANCE IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO
                            CONFIRM OR DENY SAUD'S REPORT. (TRIMBLE, CONSORTIUM ACTING CHAIRMAN AND
                            GENERAL MANAGING DIRECTOR, HAS SINCE TOLD US THAT AMUZEGAR HAS ASKED HIM

                        </list>
                        <p>The President has considered the memorandum of the Secretary of Defense
                            of July 5, 1972, "Follow-up on the President's Talk with the Shah of
                            Iran,” and has approved the following course of action:</p>
                        <p>1. F-14 and F-15 aircraft. Briefings should be offered as soon as
                            possible to Iran by service teams on the capabilities of the aircraft
                            and the training and logistics requirements associated with them. In
                            order to allow sufficient grounds for comparison of the two aircraft,
                            these initial briefings should be supplemented by appropriately spaced
                            progress reports by service teams as each aircraft moves toward the
                            operationally effective stage. The President has told the Shah that the
                            US is willing in principle to sell these aircraft as soon as we are
                            satisfied as to their operational effectiveness. Within that context,
                            decisions on purchases and their timing should be left to the Government
                            of Iran.</p>
                        <p>2. Laser-guided bombs. Briefings should be offered to the Iranians as
                            soon as possible by a US Air Force team. It is understood that weapons
                            deliveries could commence seven months after the Iranians place a formal
                            order. The President has told the Shah that the US is prepared to
                            provide this equipment to Iran.</p>
                        <p>3. Uniformed technicians. Requirements should be obtained promptly from
                            the Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Tehran, and
                            team compositions, terms of reference and costs should be worked out
                            with the Government of Iran as quickly as possible. The President has
                            informed the Shah that the US will assign in Iran an increased number of
                            uniformed military technicians from the US services to work with the
                            Iranian military services.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d214-02" facs="d214-02"/>
                        <p>The Department of Defense, in cooperation with the Department of State,
                            should proceed to implement the above as promptly as possible.</p>
                        <p>The President has also reiterated that, in general, decisions on the
                            acquisition of military equipment should be left primarily to the
                            government of Iran. If the Government of Iran has decided to buy certain
                            equipment, the purchase of US equipment should be encouraged tactfully
                            where appropriate, and technical advice on the capabilities of the
                            equipment in question should be provided.</p>

                        <p>BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>Iran enjoys a privileged status among the friends and allies of the U.S.
                            in the Middle East, a status that is commensurate with the important
                            role it assumes in our diplomatic, economic and military policies in the
                            region. Iran's special position is evident from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s memorandum of July 26,
                            1972, which states: "The President also reiterated that, in general,
                            decisions on the acquisition of military equipment should be left
                            primarily to the government of Iran. If the government of Iran has
                            decided to buy certain equipment, the purchase of U.S. equipment should
                            be encouraged tactfully where appropriate, and technical advice on the
                            capabilities of the equipment in question should be provided.”</p>
                        <p>In the absence of some overriding national policy consideration,
                            therefore, this Presidential decision on U.S. arms transfer policy
                            regarding Iran would clearly entitle Iran to the data which it has
                            requested on the Redeye missile and to the missile itself if the GOI so
                            decides. In view of the strong Iranian interest in Redeye, refusal to
                            release the weapon unless supported by a persuasive justification, would
                            be likely to lead the Shah to raise the question directly with the
                            President during his visit here in July.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            Relations</p>
                        <p>One such possible overriding consideration is the potential effect of the
                            transfer of Redeye to Iran on US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            relations. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s involvement in
                            this issue dates from November 1972. At the suggestion of Secretary of
                            Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> (in a letter to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>), a Department
                            official called in the Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Washington on
                            November 9, 1972, and expressed U.S. "concern over the possibility that
                            a portable anti-aircraft missile of the Redeye type might fall into
                            terrorist hands and be used against civilian aircraft”. In transmitting
                            this message to the Soviet Counselor, the U.S. official added that the
                            U.S. had "refrained from transferring the Redeye to governments in the
                            Near East area" and suggested the Soviets reciprocate this
                            restraint.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> official responded on November
                            16, 1972 that "the Soviet Government has taken and continues to take
                            every step to insure that (Soviet weapons comparable to Redeye) do not
                            fall into the hands of irresponsible persons.”</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d215-02" facs="d215-02"/>
                        <p>In the weeks that followed, reports were received (initially from Israeli
                            sources) that the SA-7 was in Syrian hands. We have now received
                            confirmation of this transfer. While we also received reports beginning
                            early this year that the USSR has "provided" the SA-7 to Iraq,
                            confirmation of these reports is still lacking.</p>
                        <p>The net effect of (a) the ambiguous Soviet reply of November 16, and (b)
                            confirmation of the SA-7 in Syria, has been to erode earlier arguments
                            against making Redeye available to Iran. The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, whose concern for the safety of commercial aviation
                            prompted the Department's demarche of November 9, has altered its
                            position and no longer opposes approval of Redeye for Iran. Both <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and State would propose to make known
                            our continuing concern about the dangers of the weapon, should it be
                            approved for Iran, by emphasizing in writing to the GOI the
                            indiscriminate nature of the weapon and by urging the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to institute its most stringent
                            security controls and safeguards to insure that Redeye does not fall
                            into hands of terrorists. We would hope that these same controls and
                            safeguards could be exercised to maximize the delay in the information
                            that Iran has Redeye from becoming known to such countries as Pakistan,
                            Turkey, and Israel with which Iran has frequent and close intelligence
                            exchanges. Otherwise pressures would increase from these and other
                            countries in the region which wish to acquire Redeye.</p>
                        <p>It is also proposed that we brief the Shah fully in presenting technical
                            data on Redeye, including a full presentation of its drawbacks, and
                            leave the decision on acquisition to him.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the situation, described above, we further conclude that
                            the U.S. decision to approve Redeye for Iran could not, by any
                            reasonably interpretation, be construed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as violating the "Text of Basic Principles" signed in
                            Moscow on May 29, 1972.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Security Interests</p>
                        <p>Continued denial of Redeye to Iran might be justified, however, if there
                            were a real and present danger that the missile might fall into the
                            hands of terrorists and/or be used against civilian aircraft, U.S.
                            personnel or property. In response <pb n="3" xml:id="d215-03" facs="d215-03"/>to the Department's review of these security
                            concerns, Embassy Tehran replied on May 12, vouching for Iranian
                            security practices as "more than adequate to protect Redeye hardware and
                            technical data.” </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, plans are underway to update the 1967 field survey of Iranian
                            security. The Department has received a request that a survey team visit
                            Tehran this fall but has asked that the visit be postponed in the
                            expectation that the "General Security of Information Agreement" will be
                            signed prior to the survey. The proposed Agreement, which has the Shah's
                            approval in principle, has been held up because of communications
                            problems between the Iranian Ministries of Foreign Affairs and
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Weapons Proliferation </p>
                        <p>Because of the terrorist movement and the special danger for civilian
                            aircraft posed by the Redeye missile, the U.S. has refrained from making
                            it available to countries in the Middle East. The possibility that
                            acquisition of Redeye by Iran would stimulate demands for the missile
                            from Middle Eastern countries, or precipitate a decision by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to give its SA-7 to Iraq, justifies a
                            review of the danger of proliferation of this weapon in that area.</p>

                        <p>There is an unconfirmed report that Iraq has received the SA-7. <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> concludes that the appearance of the
                            SA-7 in Iraq "would not be surprising…given Soviet efforts over the last
                            year to improve Iraqi air defense capabilities.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Lebanon </p>
                        <p>In 1963, Lebanon requested Redeye missile by diplomatic note. Its request
                            was turned down because the weapon was still at the stage of research
                            and development (R&amp;D). In 1972, the <pb n="4" xml:id="d215-04" facs="d215-04"/>Government of Lebanon by diplomatic note renewed its
                            request for technical data. The Department has not replied to the note
                            and Lebanon's request is still considered to be pending. Because Lebanon
                            has not included Redeye on recent lists of urgently desired military
                            equipment or raised the matter in discussion with American officials,
                            there is no reason to believe that Lebanon has a pressing i nterest in
                            acquiring this weapon.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israel </p>
                        <p>Israel has twice been denied information on Standard Redeye. A renewed
                            Israeli request for Standard Redeye submitted to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> in 1972 is still outstanding. The Israelis have not
                            been pressing the matter, but would likely begin to do so should they
                            believe we intended to release Redeye to any Arab state. Furthermore,
                            Israel may well be developing the simple technology for itself.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Saudi Arabia </p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia communicated its interest in Redeye prior to Prince Sultan's
                            visit to Washington in June 1972. Briefing papers at that time
                            recommended that the Saudis be discouraged from procuring the weapon on
                            grounds (a) that it could be used indiscriminately and (b) we were not
                            selling it elsewhere in the Middle East. As far as we know, the Saudis
                            have not pursued the matter further.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Turkey </p>
                        <p>General Dynamics Corporation, manufacturer of Redeye, has submitted two
                            requests to the United States Government, for approval of the export of
                            technical data (a) one on Standard Redeye, and (b) one on Naval Redeye
                            to Turkey. Both these requests are pending. Unless the Government of
                            Turkey submits an official request, there is no intention to grant
                            approval of either of the above requests. However, if the GOT submits an
                            official request for technical data and/or the weapon itself, such a
                            request would be approved because Turkey is a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> member. </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary </p>
                        <p>The Soviet introduction of its SA-7 into the Middle East, i.e. to Egypt
                            and Syria, coupled with its ambiguous reply to our demarche last
                            November, means that there is no serious possibility of excluding this
                            type of weapon from the area. If, <pb n="5" xml:id="d215-05" facs="d215-05"/>despite our objective presentation to the Shah, Iran
                            decides to acquire the Redeye, and if as a result Saudi Arabia should
                            renew interest in it, there would clearly be added pressure on us to let
                            the Saudis acquire it. However, such a request, and any others that
                            might be received in the area, should be considered on their merits and
                            in the light of our national interest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Control Policy</p>
                        <p>From an arms control standpoint there appear to be no compelling reasons
                            to disapprove Iran's request for technical data on Redeye, or the
                            missile itself, provided that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            receives satisfactory assurances from Iran with respect to the safeguard
                            of this system.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the indications noted above, it is likely that the
                            approval of Redeye for Iran may lead in the future to a renewal of
                            interest on the part of some countries in the Middle East to acquire
                            that missile. ACDA recommends that such requests be subject to a
                            case-by-case review, including an assessment of the capabilities of
                            prospective recipient countries to safeguard against the possible
                            capture or other devious acquisition of the missile by terrorist groups
                            operating in those countries.</p>

                                military support to be provided to Iran. While recommending a
                                forthcoming response, the Embassy also urged that Washington
                                emphasize the non-operative role contemplated for U.S. personnel
                                assisting the Iranian forces. (Ibid., RG 59, Central Files 1970-73,

                        <p>In the back channel message at Tab B, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> directed your attention to an
                            embassy telegram which I have attached under <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>'s incoming message and asked for your guidance.
                            The subject is the "blue-suiters" — the US military technical personnel
                            —which the President promised to the Shah. We are now getting into the
                            specifics of exactly how this is to be worked out, and it is in that
                            context that <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> sent his
                            message. </p>
                        <p>Since that message, <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> has
                            sent another regular telegram [Tab C] which removes the issue he raised.
                            However, I want you to be aware of the issue and believe you will want
                            to respond to <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> in any
                            case. </p>
                        <p>Just to put <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>'s initial
                            cable into context and to tell you where we stand on this whole subject,
                            there will be two general questions to be addressed as we work out the
                            kind of mission we send:</p>
                        <p>—A lot of work will have to be done at the military level in cooperation
                            with the Iranians to identify the jobs that need to be done, and that in
                            turn will affect the numbers of US technicians required. This will take
                            about two months in Iran and here. At that point, there may be some
                            question about the magnitude of our operation. The number could reach
                            2500-3000 and with dependents that could raise the American military
                            presence toward 10,000. But we cannot intelligently discuss the total
                            number until the jobs to be done are identified, and that is what the
                            Pentagon and the Iranians are working on now.</p>
                        <p>—The immediate issue is to get clear exactly what kinds of jobs the US is
                            committed to doing, and it is on this point that <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> sent his first cable. For the
                            most part, that is a job for the military to figure out, but there is
                            one policy issue that should be addressed now.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d216-02" facs="d216-02"/>
                        <p>The issue is that the Iranian air force presented to our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> chief projections which include US
                            personnel to occupy operational positions in Iranian units. As we have
                            previously talked about and applied the "blue-suiter" approach, we have
                            not envisioned operational personnel such as air crews to fly the F-4s;
                            our picture has been that we would supply people to work alongside
                            Iranians in their units to train them in the use of equipment and in US
                            operational concepts. In military terms, we have operated and envisioned
                            a very sophisticated on-the-job training program. Now the Iranians have
                            added this new element.</p>
                        <p>To make this more concrete, our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> so
                            far has had requests for: (1) 50 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            pilots to fly F-4s; (2) 6 boom operators for air refuelers (KC-707); (3)
                            24 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> crewmen for P3E aircraft to fly
                            maritime patrol; (4) 12 pilots and flight engineers for air refuelers.
                            The last two requests could be met by civilian contract personnel as
                            well as by <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> men. Other requests
                            could surface from the army and navy.</p>
                        <p>The issue, therefore, is whether as a general practice we will draw a
                            line short of manning combat elements of Iranian units with <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> in his first
                            embassy telegram proposed that this line be drawn. He used it
                            tentatively when faced with the initial Iranian proposal He proposed
                            telling the Iranians that our concept is to expand the well defined
                            technical training teams which have operated in Iran so far but to draw
                            a distinction between those and the assignment of US personnel for
                            online operational responsibilities. <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> would make it clear that we are prepared to help
                            in every way possible but recommended telling the Iranians now that an
                            operational role "is not possible and was not contemplated in previous
                            discussions.” This could be discussed fully with the Shah, so it would
                            not appear that we were backing out on a promise. Presumably the Shah
                            himself has an interest in not looking as if his forces are being run by
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, US forces do have arrangements with, some of the
                            countries of the British Commonwealth for exchanging operational
                            officers. The logic is that if we were some day to conduct joint
                            operations, as we have in the past, it would be useful for each side to
                            understand the operating procedures of the other. We could do this on a
                            small scale with Iranians, too, if it seemed mutually beneficial.
                            However, that exchange relationship is a somewhat different concept from
                            sending active-duty US military personnel to operate some combat
                            elements of the Iranian forces.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d216-03" facs="d216-03"/>
                        <p> US operational personnel could be provided if necessary, but since that
                            so far is a relatively small portion of the overall job, it is worth
                            considering some of the problems that would arise. The main one at home
                            is the issue of our intimate military involvement in ways that would
                            give other governments some control over further US involvement. The
                            Congressional implications are obvious. Then the question of doing this
                            for others like the Saudis or Pakistanis might arise. Also, if the Shah
                            were to use his military forces against someone in the Gulf with Saudi
                            opposition, for instance, we would face the problem of whether to allow
                            our personnel to participate in such an operation.</p>
                        <p>The most important consideration, which stands in a class by itself, is
                            that the US has made a major issue with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for its operational role in Egypt. Our doing the same
                            in Iran—especially in the wake of <persName corresp="#p_SAMAAS1">Sadat</persName>'s decision- -would have implications that you can
                            assess better than I. Simply moving 2500-3000 advisers into Iran may
                            have some implications, but I assume they are manageable.</p>
                        <p>The basic point, it seems to me, is that we can do most of what the Shah
                            wants without getting into these problems. A substantial enlargement of
                            our technical assistance field teams can make a major contribution to
                            speeding up the training and effectiveness of the Iranian forces, while
                            our doing the job for the Iranians is not all that helpful in the long
                            run. In the few cases where operational people are required for a time,
                            civilian contractors could do the job and we might even let a few <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> technicians slip in as an exception.
                            But as a general rule to start, it might be wise to stop short of
                            operational personnel in combat units.</p>
                        <p>My assumption is that this issue really was not addressed by the
                            President at all in Tehran, and in any case the Shah himself has now
                            told his people that he does not want Americans in an operational role.
                            After <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>'s initial cable, he
                            was informed by Court Minister Alain that Iran did not envisage an
                            operational role for US technicians and that these proposals were the
                            result of overzealousness at lower levels. This essentially removes the
                            issue, but I proposed that you still give <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> an answer to his question. </p>

                            back-channel to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> and that I use this as guidance in formulating

                        <p>I have read Tehran's 4467, and Hal Saunders has involved himself in
                            formulating the formal response to it. I apologize for the delay in my
                            own response. As you note I have been traveling again. Now I have read
                            Tehran 4639 which seems to resolve the issue, but I want you to have the
                            response in any case.</p>
                        <p>For your personal guidance only, this is one of those cases where the
                            commitment made was a broad one without specific reference to the kinds
                            of details which we must now address. My own feeling is that the
                            distinction you described in your initial telegram—-that we should do
                            all we possibly can to provide technical assistance and training short
                            of actually having US personnel occupy operational positions in the
                            Iranian forces—is a sensible one as a general practice. However, it was
                            very important that this not be handled in such a way as to dissipate
                            the advantage gained from the President's very forthcoming response.
                            Your talk with ALAM seems to indicate that we are over that hurdle.</p>
                        <p>If you need to discuss the subject confidentially any further, you might
                            consider noting the following points:</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d216-05" facs="d216-05"/>
                        <p>—The Pentagon and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> have been
                            instructed to work with the Iranian forces to identify the tasks where
                            US personnel can be useful. You understand this will take a couple of
                            months in Iran and in Washington. We want to be sure we are organizing
                            ourselves to do this properly and do not want to go at it piecemeal and
                            find later that we have to go back and start over. You are sure that
                            consultations will go smoothly. We will assure that they go as quickly
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>—We continue to envision our role as working alongside Iranians with a
                            training rather than an operational mission. We would like to maintain
                            that distinction for two important reasons: (1) Operational involvement
                            would raise domestic opposition over military involvement which we could
                            otherwise avoid. (2) having attacked the Soviets persistently for their
                            operational role in Egypt, we would prefer not to assume that role now
                            ourselves, and we want to avoid anything that would make it appear as if
                            Iran were somehow dependent on US forces. Since training is the main
                            mission, we feel almost all of what the Shah wants done can be done this
                            way and we do not feel making this distinction as a general practice
                            will significantly limit the effectiveness of the new program. If there
                            were a few cases where minor exceptions seemed logical for a period, we
                            could certainly be flexible.</p>

                        <p>You may not need to use this, but I did want to confirm that we are in

                            ORGANS, URBAN GUERRILLAS ARE MAINTAINING RATE OF ACTIVITY. DURING PAST
                            FOUR MONTH PERIOD THERE HAVE BEEN 28 CONFIRMED EXPLOSIONS (11 OF WHICH
                            DIRECTED AGAINST US PRESENCE), TEN SHOOTOUTS AND SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS

                            INCIDENTS REPORTED ON ALMOST DAILY BASIS.</p>

                            POLICE, REACTING VIGOROUSLY AND WITH HEAVY HAND. DURING SAME PERIOD AT
                            LEAST 16 GUERRILLAS KILLED IN CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, 13 OTHERS
                            ANNOUNCED EXECUTED, TEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT REPRIEVED AND SENTENCE TO
                            LIFE IN PRISON, NINE OTHERS GIVEN LIFE, AND 39 CONVICTED AND GIVEN
                            SENTENCES RANGING FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS. ALL OF ABOVE TRIED BY MILITARY
                            TRIBUNALS, AND MAJLES HAS RECENTLY PASSED LAW PROVIDING SPECIFICALLY
                            THAT ALL THOSE ENGAGING IN ACTS OF SABOTAGE WILL BE TRIED BY MILITARY
                            COURTS WITH POSSIBLE SENTENCES RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO DEATH. GOI HAS
                            COMMITTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO SO FAR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO
                            CONTROL TERRORISTS—FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF OFFICERS NORMALLY DETAILED TO
                            WORK WITH <gloss target="#t_BNDD1">BNDD</gloss> AGENTS ON NARCOTICS
                            MATTERS HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO GUERRILLA PROBLEM.</p>
                        <p>3. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED IN TEHRAN THAT URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS
                            INCREASING AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT A GREATER NUMBER OF INCIDENTS ARE
                            BEING REPORTED IN THE CONTROLLED LOCAL MEDIA. BUT INCREASED RAPPORTAGE,
                            WHICH MAY RESULT AS MUCH FROM REPUTED PRESSURE FROM LOCAL PRESSMEN ON
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AS FROM CONTINUING GOVERNMENT
                            DESIRE TO EXPLOIT LESS SAVORY ASPECTS OF GUERRILLA OPERATIONS DOES NOT
                            COVER ALL INCIDENTS INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED BY EMBASSY LET ALONE THE
                            MANY GUERRILLA ACTIVITY WHICH ARE RUMORED BUT NOT CONFIRMED. MOREOVER
                            FREQUENCY OF UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAS INCREASED BY A FACTOR AT LEAST AS
                            GREAT AS THAT OF THOSE GIVEN MEDIA COVERAGE, LEADING TO PRESUMPTION THAT
                            STEPPED UP TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS A REALITY AND NOT A RESULT OF INSPIRED
                            PUBLICITY. PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN INCREASED GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS
                            FACT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF INCIDENTS HAS CONTINUED INTO SUMMER WHEN

                            OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE. SAVAK MAINTAINING
                            ITS POLICY OF WIDESPREAD PREVENTIVE ARRESTS AND, WHILE THIS RUNS RISK OF
                            HEIGHTENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE, OFFICIALS SEEM CONFIDENT THAT
                            GUERRILLAS ARE ON THE RUN. WE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE OFFICIAL OPTIMISM
                            AND FEEL THAT SANGUINE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE GUERRILLA REACTION THEY
                            USUALLY PROVOKE MAY FURTHER ERODE CREDIBILITY OF SECURITY ORGANS IN MIND

                        <p>END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>1. IN WAKE OF SMOOTHLY HANDLED ASSASSINATION AUGUST 13 OF HEAD OF PRISONS
                            BRIGADIER GENERAL SAID TAHERI (<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>) WHO WAS ALSO CHIEF OF AN ANTI-GUERRILLA SUBCOMMITTEE
                            WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FREQUENCY OF TERRORIST
                            ACTIVITIES HAS INCREASED. RECENT CONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAVE INCLUDED A
                            BOMB IN A TEHRAN DEPARTMENT STORE WHICH INJURED THE TERRORIST PLANTING
                            IT, BOMB IN TEHRAN NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY BUILDING WHICH KILLED
                            WATCHMAN, APPREHENSION OF A TERRORIST IN SOUTH TEHRAN WHICH RESULTED IN
                            ONE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED, AND SHOOTING TO DEATH OF THREE POLICEMEN IN
                            A SMALL BAZAAR IN SOUTH TEHRAN. NUMEROUS OTHER BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS
                            RUMORED BUT NOT VERIFIED BY EMBASSY OR CONFIRMED BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>2. SAVAK AND OTHER SECURITY ORGANS ARE PROCEEDING WITH A WIDESPREAD AND,
                            WE HEAR, NOT VERY WELL TARGETED ROUND-UP OF SUSPECTS, AIDED BY LISTS OF
                            NAMES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FOUND IN DWELLING OF A RECENTLY SLAIN
                            TERRORIST LEADER. POLICE NETS, WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY HAULING IN THE
                            INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY, HAVE EXTENDED AS FAR AFIELD AS ISFAHAN WHERE A
                            NUMBER OF SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED TWO WEEKS AGO.</p>
                        <p>3. DESPITE INCREASING LEVEL OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, POLICE OFFICIALS
                            REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. CHIEF OF NATIONAL POLICE LTG JAFFARQOLI SADRI ASSURED
                            EMBOFF AUG. 17 THAT CURRENT FLURRY OF INCIDENTS CONSTITUTES DYING GASP
                            OF GUERRILLAS WHO, HE CLAIMS, HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY TWO THIRDS IN PAST
                            YEAR AND ARE FORCED TO ACT NOW TO SHOW THEY STILL EXIST. IN A MEDIA
                            INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN LOCAL PRESS AUG. 19, SADRI UPPED FIGURE FOR
                            REDUCTION OF GUERRILLA FORCES TO THREE FOURTHS, PREDICTED THAT REMAINING
                            TERRORISTS WOULD SOON BE WIPED OUT AND REITERATED STANDARD GOVERNMENT
                            LINE THAT GUERRILLAS ARE CONFUSED MISGUIDED INDIVIDUALS OF
                            MARXIST-LENINIST BENT BUT WITHOUT GOALS OR PROGRAM. IN DISCUSSION WITH
                            EMBOFF SADRI ATTACHED NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO MURDER OF GENERAL
                            TAHERI, ASSERTING THAT TERRORISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISIFED WITH ANY
                            HIGH-RANKING OFFICER AND CHOSE TAWERI ONLY BECUASE OF IOSLATED LOCATION
                            OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR LONG WALKS ALONE. SADRI ALSO
                            DISCOUNTED POSSIBILITY THAT ASSASSINS WERE OF HIGHER CALIBER THAN
                            RUN-OF-THE-MILL GUERRILLAS, POINTING OUT THAT SHOTS WHICH KILLED TAHERI
                            HAD BEEN FIRED FROM 50 CENTIMETERS AND THAT "A CHILD COULD HIT A MAN
                            FROM THAT DISTANCE.”</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: WE CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAT TAHERI WAS PERSONALLY TARGETED
                            DUE TO HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER,
                            SKILLFUL MANNER IN WHICH ASSASSINATION CARRIED OUT, REQUIRING CAREFUL
                            PLANNING AND RECONNAISSANCE AS WELL AS DEFT EXECUTION, APPEARS TO
                            INDICATE THAT THOSE INVOLVED WERE MUCH BETTER TRAINED THAN AVERAGE
                            TERRORISTS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THEIR OWN BOMBS.</p>
                        <p>IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NUMBER OF GUERRILLA INCIDENTS WILL BEGIN TO TAPER
                            OFF, BUT WE DO NOT SHARE SADRI'S CONFIDENCE THAT HIS TACTICS AND THOSE
                            OF SAVAK CAN COMPLETELY HALT TERRORIST ACTIVITY. IN FACT OVER REACTION
                            AND TOO ZEALOUS A REPRESSION BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS SEEM AT LEAST AS
                            LIKELY TO RECRUIT <pb n="3" xml:id="d218-03" facs="d218-03"/>NEW
                            GUERRILLAS AS TO STAMP OUT OLD ONES. IN ADDITION WISDOM SEEMS
                            QUESTIONABLE OF SECURITY OFFICIALS MAKING PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT
                            BREAKUP OF GUERRILLA GROUPS AND PREDICTIONS OF THEIR DEMISE. WE RECALL
                            THAT THE LAST SUCH ANNOUNCEMENT LAST JANUARY WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIES OF
                            EXPLOSIONS ON US-PROPERTIES AND OTHER SITES IN TEHRAN. IN OUR VIEW SUCH
                            PUBLIC DECLARATIONS RUN RISK OF INCREASING CREDIBILITY GAP AND
                            RESENTMENT ON PART OF PUBLIC WHO LIKELY BE INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE OF
                            INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE STAMPING OUT
                            TERRORISTS.</p>
                        <p>THE PROGNOSTICATION THEREFORE IS FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE TERRORISM BUT,
                            DESPITE SUCCESSFUL MURDER OF TAHERI, WE DO NOT CONCLUDE THAT GUERRILLAS
                            WILL NOW PLACE GREATER RELIANCE ON ASSASSINATION AS A TOOL. REASON IS
                            THAT TERRORISTS STILL LACK ENOUGH TRAINED PERSONNEL TO PULL OFF
                            ASSASSINATIONS ON REGULAR BASIS.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY </p>
                        <p>Associated Press correspondent in Iran, Parviz Raein, cites the
                            mistreatment by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> (The Iranian
                            Security and Information Organization) of a prominent Iranian citizen
                            and <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s mis- handling of student
                            protests over increased bus fares in Tehran two years ago as examples of
                            unchecked power by the Iranian security authorities that, in his view,
                            create opposition rather than dispose of it. Raein charges that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> Chief, General <persName corresp="#p_NNGN1">Nematollah Nassiri</persName>, has become
                            extremely corrupt and that Iranian officials, even those very close to
                            the Shah, are afraid to cross the Intelligence Organization. Raein
                            professed to be personally worried, as were many of his friends, about
                            what the future holds for Iran unless the power of Iran's security
                            apparatus is checked.</p>
                        <p>During a recent call by the reporting officer on Associated Press Iran
                            representative, Parviz Raein (protect), the subject of urban terrorism
                            came up. Whereupon Raein launched into a dissertation, the central theme
                            of which was that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> itself is
                            primarily responsible for the phenomenon. Raein said he was not
                            attempting to deny that there were basic tensions and strains in present
                            day Iranian society on which terrorists might feed. Rather, he was
                            arguing that over reaction and inflexibility by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> constituted the critical spark that
                            had led to violence. <pb n="2" xml:id="d220-02" facs="d220-02"/>Raein
                            continued that with a terrorist incident, such as a bombing or shooting,
                            occurring almost every day in Tehran, it was hard to remember that there
                            was no real terrorism in Iran before the summer of 1970. In that year
                            bus fares were suddenly increased in Tehran from two to five rials*.
                            Students at Tehran University had reacted vigorously against the hike in
                            fares, breaking bus windows and overturning some vehicles. <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> had then reacted savagely. </p>
                        <p>[footnote] (*) $1.00 = 76.25 rls </p>
                        <p> Raein charged that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> had arrested
                            hundreds of students, beaten some of them nearly to death and expelled
                            50 of them permanently from the University. The expelled students were
                            not permitted to work, to go abroad to study or to enter any other
                            university in Iran. In short, they were left in limbo. That is still the
                            situation they find themselves in. The students had signed an apology
                            and various efforts by family and friends had been made to secure
                            clemency from the Shah, but all attempts had failed. The supplicants had
                            gotten to General Fereidun Jam, Chief of the Supreme Commanders Staff at
                            that time, with a petition, pointing out that at least two of the
                            expellees were in their next to last year of medical school and that it
                            seemed unfair to prevent them from completing their professional
                            training. But Jam refused on grounds that he could not intercede with
                            the Shah in what was <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s business. </p>
                        <p>The Associated Press representative said it was no wonder that university
                            students made up the bulk of the terrorists. University students all
                            over Iran believed that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> was
                            acting unjustly in keeping the expelled students in a state of "living
                            death,” and bitterly resented <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s
                            high handedness. It was outraged students who made up the bulk of the
                            terrorist groups, Raein contended. Moreover, the students had plenty of
                            sympathizers, not only among their families and friends but among others
                            who feared <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> power. </p>
                        <p> Raein said he wished to cite another example of <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> tyranny that had even less
                            justification than had <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>
                            repression against the <pb n="3" xml:id="d220-03" facs="d220-03"/>students. This example involved a single individual, Sadiq Behdad, and
                            since <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s action against him had
                            occasioned no public outcry, or even notice, Raein felt a little uneasy
                            because he realized that the same thing could happen to anyone in
                            present day Iran, including himself.</p>
                        <p> Sadiq Behdad was described as a highly successful Tehran lawyer. Three
                            years ago he was making the equivalent of more than $100,000 a year. He
                            had been in the opposition as a student but that had been many years
                            before. Now he was legal counsel to a dozen important Iranian firms and
                            a pillar of the establishment.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly in the late summer of 1969 Behdad disappeared. Nothing was heard
                            of him for 52 days. On the 52nd day his wife was driven to a house in
                            Tehran where she found her husband dazed and inquiring why she would be
                            coming to see him in the night time. In fact the sun was shining
                            brightly outside. Behdad told his wife that he was the prisoner of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>, as she had already
                            surmised. </p>
                        <p> Behdad's friends eventually put together the incidents which had aroused
                            the suspicions of <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>. These were
                            that one of Behdad's close relatives had died. Letters of condolence had
                            arrived from all over Iran and some had come from abroad. One of these
                            was from General Taimour Bakhtiar written from Switzerland. Bakhtiar, a
                            former <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> Chief, was in exile at
                            the time. Although the General's letter was entirely innocuous and
                            contained only Bakhtiar's regrets over the death in Behdad's family, the
                            latter remembering his opposition days as a student and <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s reputation for being super
                            suspicious, decided on impulse to destroy the letter. This he did by
                            tearing it to bits and flushing it down the drain.</p>
                        <p>A few days later Behdad was arrested by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> who queried him as to whether he had heard anything
                            recently from Bakhtiar. The hapless Behdad foolishly replied that he had
                            heard nothing, not realizing that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> knew better. For what had happened was that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> had intercepted Bakhtiar's letter
                            at Behdad's old address photostated it and had it delivered, apparently
                            unopened, at Behdad's newer and more expensive address. <pb n="4" xml:id="d220-04" facs="d220-04"/>Not to drag the story out unduly,
                            Behdad was tried in secret and given a seven year sentence. Every effort
                            by his friends to secure his release failed until just a few days ago.
                            Court Minister Alam and the Prime Minister himself were represented as
                            unwilling to approach the Shah on the case, on grounds that “<gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s business is <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>'s business.” Raein himself, who
                            claims to be a friend of ALAM, said he had personally seen ALAM three
                            times on the case. When he last saw ALAM about a month ago, ALAM tipped
                            him off that Behdad and some others were about to be released.
                            Subsequently, according to Raein, Behdad has been set free but nothing
                            has appeared in the media to this effect. Raein says Behdad's problem
                            now is to try to pick up the threads of his life, but it is doubtful if
                            he can ever again become a prominent lawyer due to the residue of
                            suspicion that will attach to him as a former prisoner.</p>
                        <p> Raein said that the corruption of General <persName corresp="#p_NNGN1">Nassiri</persName> is widely known. Next to the Shah, <persName corresp="#p_NNGN1">Nassiri</persName> has become the biggest
                            landowner on the Caspian Sea. <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>
                            power has become more and more unchallengeable; and as its power has
                            grown so has its corruption. The Shah unfortunately pays greater heed to
                                <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> counsels than he does to
                            anybody else. This is very dangerous because <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> believes in handling criticism and dissidence with an
                            iron fist when what is needed is more flexibility and clemency towards
                            dissenters. The handling by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> of
                            the Tehran University students was a perfect example of how iron
                            repression had backfired. If the Shah would only pardon the expelled
                            students much of the heart would go out of the terrorist movement. But
                            Raein had little hope that he would do so because <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> was surely advising him against
                            clemency.</p>
                        <p>The Associated Press representative said he is very much disturbed by the
                            omnipotence of the Security Organization. His own material welL-being
                            was about everything he could hope for. He had no real needs and his
                            professional life was full, successful and satisfying. Should he not
                            therefore feel himself an integral part of the Establishment? Yet he did
                            not and it worried him. A man needed not only material wealth; spiritual
                            freedom was also necessary and that was more and more missing in Iran
                            today.</p>

                        <p>COMMENT: We are not attempting to say anything definitive about <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> at this point. However, Raein is a
                            substantial and intelligent Iranian citizen who fears, as we do, that
                            harsh <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policies towards internal
                            dissenters may in fact be hardening the attitudes of guerrillas and
                            their smypathizers. We shall be watching and reflecting on the complex
                            interrelationship between an often over zealous security organization
                            and those Iranian elements who quietly or violently resist such
                            concentration of power. Meanwhile, Parviz Raein's views are of interest. </p>

                        <p>1. F-14 and F-15 Aircraft</p>
                        <p>On 9 September 1972, the Shah of Iran and members of the Supreme
                            Commander's Staff were briefed by US Navy and US Air Force teams on the
                            F-14 and F-15 aircraft. The Chief, ARMISH-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Tehran, reports that the three hour and forty-five
                            minute uninterrupted briefings were well received; the Shah was
                            appreciative, and he asked many technical questions which were readily
                            answered by the team members. The Shah also asked questions about the
                            possible use of the AWG-9 Radar and Phoenix missile in helicopters and
                            the P-3 reconnaissance aircraft. He is apparently interested in
                            exploring ways to use this equipment in various roles against
                            water-borne surface targets. In this connection, the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> noted the Shah is thinking of giving
                            attack missions to the P-3 aircraft and that he stated Iran had to
                            become an Indian Ocean power. The Shah stated that he recognizes time is
                            required to perfect the F-14 and F-15 aircraft, and that he visualizes
                            that his operational squadrons will be echeloned at least two years
                            after those of the US. He said that he would make the decision as to the
                            best type of aircraft for Iran when the time comes. In a development
                            possibly related to the Shah's F-14/15 plans, the Iranians have canceled
                            the <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> case for the purchase of 36
                            F-5E's, i.e. the last two squadrons. Iran now has outstanding orders for
                            eight squadrons of F-5E's (141 aircraft).</p>

                        <p>2. Laser-Guided Bombs</p>
                        <p>The laser-guided bomb presentation was given at this same briefing. The
                            Shah was particularly impressed with the laser bombs and directed
                            immediate action to modify some of his F-4D's as designators and to
                            procure some bomb kits. The Iranians are considering modifying 6-12
                            aircraft for laser designators and may purchase around 1,500 laser bomb
                            guidance kits. The Shah indicated he preferred to await the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> decision on the light-weight
                            self-contained laser designator before requesting additional systems.
                            Specific requirements are now being refined with the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and a member of the Air Force
                            briefing team.</p>
                        <p>3. Uniformed Technicians</p>
                        <p>The joint State/Defense message, reported on 12 August 1972 as awaiting
                            release, was dispatched on 31 August 1972, after receiving White House
                            approval. This message supported Embassy/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> attempts to limit the numbers of technicians requested
                            and to ensure that the technicians will not be used in operational
                            roles. It further stated that the <gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss>
                            approach or a similar arrangement appears to be the most suitable method
                            of meeting Iran's needs. (Message is attached.)</p>
                        <p>Initial ARMISH-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> report on numbers of
                            technicians required was 1,297 for CY73 with additional to be required
                            in subsequent years. Upon further analysis by the ARMISH-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, it appears that substantially fewer military
                            technicians may be required. Detailed requirements are currently being
                            prepared in Iran and will be forwarded for <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>/State evaluation upon completion.</p>
                        <p>At <gloss target="#t_ASDISA1">ASD/ISA</gloss> request, interested <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> offices, Military Departments, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are providing their preliminary
                            views as to personnel, policy, legal status of forces, support
                            requirements, and other problems that may be associated with the
                            provision of technical assistance of this magnitude.</p>

                        <p>1. FOR SOME TIME WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED BY LOCAL RUMORS AND STATEMENTS
                            FROM WASHINGTON THAT NARCOTICS ARE BEING SMUGGLED FROM IRAN TO OTHER
                            GULF STATES AND PRESUMABLY THENCE INTO WORLD MARKETS. WE ARE AWARE OF
                            SEIZURES OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF OPIUM FROM IRANIAN PILGRIMS TO MECCA,
                            BUT ONLY REPORT THAT WE HAVE <pb n="2" xml:id="d222-02" facs="d222-02"/>SEEN PROVIDING EVIDENCE TYING IRAN TO SMUGGLING OF COMMERCIAL
                            QUANTITIES OF OPIUM IS MANAMA'S A-6 OF MARCH 28, 1972, WHICH DOES NOT
                            INDICATE HOW BAHRAINI AUTHORITIES ASCERTAINED ORIGIN OF SEIZED OPIUM. US
                            MISSION TO IRANIAN GENDARMERIE (GENMISH) RECENTLY HEARD REPORT THAT 80
                            KG OF OPIUM, SOURCE UNKNOWN, WAS DUE TO BE SMUGGLED BY DHOW FROM PORT OF
                            TIZ NEAR BAHAR TO DUBAI, BUT UNABLE CONFIRM. WE HAVE ALSO RECENTLY BEEN
                            TOLD THAT OPIUM BEING SMUGGLED BY SEA INTO SE IRAN AND POSSIBLY BEYOND
                            FROM PAKISTAN. AGAIN UNABLE TO CONFIRM.</p>
                        <p>2. MOST OF OUR SOURCES FOR STATEMENTS ABOUT DRUG SMUGGLING THROUGH GULF
                            APPEAR TO BASE ALLEGATIONS ON GULF'S DESERVED REPUTATION AS ROUTE FOR
                            SMUGGLING EVERYTHING ELSE. NEVERTHELESS, SMUGGLING VESSELS CAPTURED BY
                            IRAN TO DATE HAVE YIELDED GOLD, CURRENCY, WATCHES AND OTHER HIGH-DUTY
                            CONSUMER GOODS, BUT NO NARCOTICS. GENDARMERIE BOAT BATTALION PERSONNEL
                            WHO CARRY OUT ANTI-SMUGGLING PATROLS ADMITTEDLY NOT NARCOTICS EXPERTS,
                            BUT IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THEY WOULD MISS ALL CACHES OF NARCOTICS IF
                            TRAFFIC OF MAJOR PROPORTIONS, AS ALLEGED.</p>
                        <p>3. DIRECT LAND SMUGGLING ROUTES FOR AFGHAN OR PAK OPIUM TO GULF WOULD BE
                            THROUGH EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TERRAIN. EXTENT OF WATERLESS DESERT WOULD
                            REQUIRE USE OF CAMELS OR VEHICLES, INSTEAD OF HORSES AS FAVORED IN
                            NORTH, WHICH WOULD HAVE TO CROSS LONG DISTANCES WITHOUT COVER FROM
                            AERIAL SURVEILLANCE. TRADITIONAL NORTHERN ROUTE JOINING ROAD NET FROM
                            TEHRAN SOUTH WOULD BE EASIER ROUTE TO GULF, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO
                            SEIZURES TO CONFIRM ITS EXISTENCE.</p>
                        <p>4. TO COMBAT WHATEVER NARCOTICS TRAFFIC THERE MAY BE IN GULF WE NEED FIRM
                            AND DETAILED EVIDENCE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND SIZE TO BRING TO ATTENTION OF
                            GOI ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. WE WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING ANY SUCH
                            EVIOENCE ADDRESSES CAN PROVIDE.</p>

                            CHANNELED INTO OR THROUGH PAKISTAN TO GULF? IN SPITE OF QAMAR UL ISLAM
                            STATEMENT (STATE 178560) THAT PAK COASTAL TRAFFIC UNDER CONTROL, IS
                            THERE EVIDENCE OF ILLICIT OPIUM FROM ANY SOURCE LEAVING PAKISTAN BY
                            SEA?</p>
                        <p>5. IF SUCH INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABE, WE ARE CONVINCED IRANIAN
                            GENDARMERIE WILL MAKE GOOD USE OF IT. SUCH INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE
                            VALUABLE ASSISTANCE TO US IN OUR EFFORTS ENCOURAGE GENDARMERIE TO BUILD

                        <p>SUMMARY: <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE
                            AUTHORIZED AREA FOR POPPY CULTIVATION IN 1973 TO 10 PERCENT OF 1972
                            LEVEL. END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>ACTION REQUESTED: DEPARTMENT CONSIDER CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE FROM
                            APPROPRIATE US OFFICIAL, WHEN GOI PUBLICLY ANNOUNCES DECISION.</p>
                        <p>1. MINISTRY OF COOPERATIVES HAS INFORMED US THAT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WILL AUTHORIZE CULTIVATION OF ONLY 2.000 (TWO THOUSAND)
                            HECTARES OF OPIUM POPPIES IN CROP YEAR 1973, AS COMPARED WITH 20,000
                            (TWENTY THOUSAND) HECTARES IN 1972. DECISION HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLISHED
                            IN OFFICIAL GAZETTE, OR OTHERWISE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED, BUT WE UNDERSTAND
                            THAT IT IS FINAL.</p>
                        <p>2. DECISION TAKEN BECAUSE AMOUNT OF OPIUM IN STORAGE FROM LEGAL
                            CULTIVATION AND SMUGGLING SEIZURES IS <pb n="2" xml:id="d223-02" facs="d223-02"/>SURPLUS TO NEEDS OF REGISTERED ADDICTS BY ALMOST ONE
                            YEAR'S SUPPLY. THIS IMPLIES, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED IT,
                            CONCOMITANT TACIT DECISION NOT TO LOWER AGE OF ELIGIBIBLITY FOR
                            REGISTRATION, AS OCCASIONALLY DISCUSSED.</p>
                        <p>3. REDUCATION DECISION APPLIES ONLY TO 1973 CROP YEAR, BUT IT SHOWS
                            WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TO MAKE
                            DRASTIC CUTS IN OPIUM PRODUCTION WHENEVER INDICATED. SINCE ALL LEGAL
                            GROWERS ARE MEMBERS OF STATE-SPONSORED COOPERATION, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS MEANS ALREADY AT HAND TO ENFORCE
                            CUTS AND MINIMIZE EFFECT ON FARMERS' INCOME. WE UNDERSTAND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> IS CONSIDERING WAYS OF USING CUT TO
                            DRAMATIZE TO NEIGHBOURING PRODUCING COUNTRIES ITS LONG-STANDING POSITION
                            THAT IT WILL REIMPOSE COMPLETE PRODUCTION BAN WHEN NEIGHBORS ABLE TO
                            RECIPROCATE.</p>
                        <p>4. ONCE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED
                            DECISION, WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR APPROPRIATE US OFFICIAL TO

                            EXPRESSING HOPE THAT PROGRESS BY NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES IN HALTING
                            ILLICIT POPPY CULTIVATION WILL SOON MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR GOI TO

                            THREAT FROM NEIGHBORS ELIMINATED.</p>

                            wrote the White House, this time requesting a reply to his September 1

                        <p>We recommend no reply to <persName corresp="#p_AAA1">Afshar</persName>.
                            For reasons outlined in my Memorandum for the Files of April 26, 1972,
                            we and the Shah consider this organization (possibly a one-man
                            operation) offensive.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>In the July edition of the Iran Free Press, the Committee for Free Iran,
                            on behalf of the Iranian government-in-exile, demanded that the Soviet
                            Union remove its advisors from Iran. We made this demand for three
                            compelling reasons.</p>
                        <p>1. There is no military threat to Iran. Excluding only the Soviet Union
                            itself; all of Iran's neighbors share with Iran a common religion and a
                            tradition of mutual trust and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>2. The Soviet staff in Iran has grown to some five thousand persons, a
                            number too large to be effectively monitored, and posing a significant
                            threat of political and economic influence. We feel the present Iranian
                            government courts disaster by allowing this potential for meddling to
                            grow unchecked.</p>
                        <p>3. The Soviet Union has several Middle East objectives not in accord with
                            the interests of the Iranian people. The Russians, having already
                            acquired unlimited natural gas rights, seek an exclusive claim on the
                            Iranian oil fields. They seek as well to supplant the American and
                            British military and economic presence with their own, and to expand
                            Soviet sway to the Persian Gulf and beyond.</p>
                        <p>It may seem that these considerations, directed as they were at Soviet
                            policy, have little direct bearing on the policies of the United States.
                            This is not, however, the case. The government-in- exile believes
                            strongly in the principle of Iranian neutrality. It is a cornerstone of
                            its program for progress that Iran, while a free and democratic nation,
                            be part of an effective buffer between the communist bloc and the
                            Western free world. In this light, we must note that the most visible
                            outside military and economic support for the pre sent Iranian
                            government is not the Soviet Union but the United States. In particular,
                            although the Soviet Union has some five thousand of its citizens working
                            in Iran as so-called advisors, only about thirty of these are clearly
                            military advisors. The <pb n="3" xml:id="d225-03" facs="d225-03"/>United
                            States, on the other hand, has nearly eight hundred military advisors
                            officially assigned to the Iranian armed forces.</p>
                        <p>The United States, under your administration, has embarked on a policy of
                            reducing the American military presence throughout the world. We applaud
                            this objective. We feel the grand design of which it is a key part
                            portends a better and safer life for the people of America and of the
                            world. An immediate implementation of this policy, in the removal from
                            Iran of all non-diplomatic American personnel, is both possible and
                            desirable. We strongly urge upon the United States that this step be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Neutrality is an important goal for us. The demand we make of the
                            American government we have made equally of other nations, including the
                            Soviet Union. We seek the removal of non-essential, non-diplomatic
                            personnel in the employ of any foreign power, whether communist or free.
                            And most emphatically we seek the cessation of all military aid, from
                            whatever source, to the present Iranian government. Iran must find
                            itself; it must discover its freedom, its creative and industrious
                            spirit, and its future political and social direction unhindered by
                            outside powers.</p>
                        <p>Revolution will come to Iran. The people grow daily more weary of
                            billions spent by the Shah's government on armaments while seven out of
                            eight Iranians starve. But until revolution occurs, let us point out
                            that it is a clear moral wrong for the United States or any other party
                            to advise Shah Pahlavi to spend hard earned exchange currency on
                            weapons, unneeded and ludicrously expensive, to guide his choice, and
                            moreover to back this choice with personnel, when most families in Iran
                            must survive on less than two dollars per day. Such actions by the
                            United States are in direct and obvious conflict with America's
                            humanitarian ideals.</p>
                        <p>The Shah has perhaps his own reasons for spending huge sums of money on
                            weapons. Perhaps he intends a campaign of military adventurism; or
                            perhaps the reasons are only medical and psychiatric, rooted in Pahlavi
                            paranoia. But one fact is clear. When the people rise up against the
                            monarchy, Shah Pahlavi will use every force at his command to suppress
                            the bid for freedom; he will use without distinction all the weapons
                            supplied by the United States, all the weapons supplied by the Soviet
                            Union, every force at his disposal. Those nations that have helped
                            supply these forces must share the blame for the needless bloodshed that
                            may accompany the surge for Iranian freedom.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d225-04" facs="d225-04"/>
                        <p>We appreciate that ultimately the United States, as any other nation,
                            must conduct its affairs first and always for the good of its own
                            people. But the United States, as the strongest military and economic
                            power in world history bears an unusual burden, and must conduct its
                            affairs with uncommon restraint, recognizing the needs of far weaker
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>We know that the United States has long maintained good relations with
                            the present Shah. As long as the U.S. continues this support of
                            militarism and suppression, our quarrel with American policy runs deep.
                            The efforts of all true searchers for freedom in Iran are eroded, and
                            the risks of greater violence and of communist takeover in the
                            inevitable revolution to end the Shah's rule, become ever more
                            menacing.</p>
                        <p>But we emphatically believe that U.S. activities have been carried out
                            with good intentions and in good faith. We cling to the hope that
                            American policy may yet change, and that the long standing tradition of
                            friendship between the Iranian and American peoples may yet guide
                            America to rejection of the present undemocratic and corrupt
                            monarchy.</p>
                        <p>Please hear our plea, spoken only with the voice of ourwords for freedom
                            and of our hearts yearning for freedom, for cessation of military and
                            political support to the Shah, and for the removal of non-diplomatic
                            personnel. Continued good relations between the United States and the
                            near government for Iran may well hinge on your answer.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for taking time to consider this matter carefully.</p>

                        <p>2. I BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY STATING THAT THE COOPERATION OF THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> IS SOUGHT ON A MATTER OF HIGHEST
                            URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE WHICH MAY MATERIALLY ADVANCE PROSPECTS FOR EARLY

                            HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY AGREE TO TURN OVER TO US FOR SHIPMENT TO VIETNAM
                            THE IIAF INVENTORY OF F-5AS (90-AIRCRAFT) FOR IMMEDIATE DISASSEMBLY AND
                            DELIVERY TO VIETNAM BY FASTEST POSSIBLE US CARRIERS, (PROBABLY
                            C-5A).</p>

                            SHIPMENT. THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WILL BE PREPARED TO

                            COUNTRIES WITH F-5AS IN SIMILAR MANNER AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.</p>
                        <p>6. TO ENHANCE PROSPECTS FOR SETTLEMENT AN ANSWER IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY.
                            IT IS OF COURSE OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE TO KEEP THIS MATTER HELD AS
                            CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>7. THE SHAH SAID RE FULLY APPRECIATED THE US POSITION IN MAKING EVERY
                            EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE VIETNAM WAR FOR ALL
                            THE OBVIOUS REASONS. THEREFORE HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO DO
                            ALL HE COULD TO ASSIST IN THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF A SOLUTION. CONSEQUENTLY,
                            HE STATED, SUBJECT TO EARLY REPLACEMENT, HE WOULD BE PREPARED TO TURN
                            OVER TWO RPT TWO SQUADRONS OF F-5A, A TOTAL OF 32 AIRCRAFT.</p>
                        <p>8. I POINTED OUT THAT THE NEED WAS SO GREAT AND THE OBJECTIVE OF SUCH
                            MAGNITUDE THAT, AS HERETOFORE STATED, IT WAS HOPED THAT A LARGER NUMBER
                            OF AIRCRAFT COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE. THE SHAH AVOWED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD
                            THIS, TOGETHER WITH THE FULL IMPORT OF MY STATEMENT TO HIM, BUT
                            THEREUPON HE DWELT AT LENGTH UPON ASPECTS OF A NEW TRAINING PROGRAM
                            WHICH GOI AIR FORCE WAS INSTITUTING AND WHICH REQUIRED A MINIMUM OF 53

                            THROUGH COURT MINISTER ALAM MORNING OCTOBER 23.</p>
                        <p>2. FOR CONTINGENCY PURPOSES IN EVENT EXERCISE IS REPEATED, WISH CALL
                            ATTENTION SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FROM IRANIAN
                            PERSPECTIVE:</p>
                        <p>(A) WITH RESPECT TO REPAYMENT, SHAH'S PRIMARY INTEREST WILL NOT BE IN
                            AMOUNT OF MONEY INVOLVED, BUT RATHER IN ACCELERATED DELIVERY OF MILITARY
                            EQUIPMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE FEEL HE WILL WANT EARLIER DELIVERY OF F-5E'S
                            PRESENTLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN DECEMBER 1973. HE WOULD ALSO LIKE DELIVERY
                            DATE FOR F-4E'S TO BE ADVANCED FROM JULY 1973. EIGHT F-4E'S ARE
                            PRESENTLY LEASED TO IRANIAN AIR FORCE. WE COULD OFFER TO TRANSFER TITLE
                            ON THESE PLANES TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, CREDITING
                            PORTION OF VALUE OF TRANSFERRED F-5A'S. (IRANIAN INVENTORY INCLUDES 37
                            F-5A'S WHICH WERE PURCHASED AND 53 WHICH WERE <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-SUPPLIED.)</p>
                        <p>(B) 53 OF 90 AIRCRAFT PROPOSED FOR TRANSFER WERE SUPPLIED UNDER <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> WHICH APPEARS RAISE SEVERAL THORNY
                            LEGAL AND BUDGETING PROBLEMS. WHILE WE HAVE NO EXPERTISE IN THIS REGARD,
                            WE ASSUME <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> COULD ALSO BE COMPENSATED
                            WITH CREDIT AGAINST NEW F-5E'S OR F-4E'S ACCORDING TO SHAH'S PREFERENCE.
                            FOR FUTURE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES, THESE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE CONSIDERED
                            AS MAP-PROVIDED. WE ASSAGE SVN <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            BUDGET OR OTHER SOURCE COULD PROVIDE NECESSARY FUNDING. SHAH TOOK OFF
                            MAP ROLES IN MAY AND IRAN SHOULD NOT BE LISTED AS MAP RECIPIENT IN ANY
                            TRANSACTION.</p>

                        <p>(C) SHAH'S READINESS TO MEET OUR REQUEST WITHOUT HESITATION OR QUESTION
                            WAS ELOQUENT TESTIMONY TO EXCEEDINGLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
                            PRESIDENT AND HIM. SHOULD F-5A TRANSFER AGAIN BE PROPOSED, WE BELIEVE IT
                            WOULD BE DESIRABLE IN TERMS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP TO BRING SHAH INTO
                            PICTURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND TO RESPOND MAGNANIMOUSLY IN NEGOTIATION
                            THAT WOULD FOLLOW HIS AGREEMENT TO TRANSFER.</p>

                        <p>1. THIS MESSAGE OFFERS SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR APPROACH TO SHAH SHOULD WE
                            DECIDE ASK FOR ADDITIONAL F-5A'S.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH'S PROMPT RESPONSE TO OUR REQUEST FOR TRANSFER OF 32 F-5A'S MAY BE
                            ATTRIBUTED TO HIS SENSE OF CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT AND
                            VALUE HE ATTACHES TO THIS RELATIONSHIP AND ALSO TO HIS DESIRE TO ASSIST
                            IN BRINGING END TO WAR IN SEA. IF WE ASK HIM TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL
                            F-5A'S, WE WILL BE ASKING HIM MAKE VERY DIFFICULT DECISION, ESPECIALLY
                            IN CONTEXT RATIONAL BUILDUP OF HIS OWN FORCES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN URGING
                            ON HIM AND WITH WHICH RELEASE OF ADDITIONAL F-5A'S WILL INTERFERE. ON
                            BALANCE, WE BELIEVE THERE IS REASONABLE LIKLIHOOD HE WILL RESPOND
                            POSITIVELY, ALBEIT RELUCTANTLY. FROM POINT OF VIEW OF ROLE WE ARE
                            PLAYING IN ADVISING IIAF, IT OUR JUDGEMENT THAT 32 F-5A'S CAN BE SPARED
                            FROM IRANIAN AIR FORCE, BUT LOSS OF ANOTHER 16 WOULD HURT.</p>
                        <p>3. IF ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT NEEDED, OUR CURRENT VIEWS AFTER MORE CAREFUL
                            STUDY OF CONTINGENCY PROPOSALS IN OUR PREVIOUS MESSAGE ARE
                            FOLLOWING:</p>
                        <p>WE RECOMMEND THAT AMBASSADOR BE AUTHORIZED TO PRESSENT REQUEST AS
                            PERSONAL MESSAGE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND TO DESCRIBE IT AS OF HIGHEST
                            IMPORTANCE TO OUR EFFORTS REACH SETTLEMENT IN SVN. AS HE TOLD AMBASSADOR
                            DURING FIRST DISCUSSION, SHAH WANTS REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT RATHER THAN
                            CREDIT TOWARDS THOSE AIRCRAFT. HE HAS ALSO RECENTLY LAID STRESS ON
                            URGENT NEED FOR BEST POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE IN ACHIEVING QUALITATIVE
                            IMPROVEMENTS IN IRANIAN ARMED FORCES. IT WOULD BE USEFUL, IF AMBASSADOR
                            COULD OUTLINE FAIRLY CONCRETELY WHAT WE ARE REPARED TO DO IN BOTH <pb n="2" xml:id="d228-02" facs="d228-02"/>REGARDS. IN ORDER OF PRIORITY
                            WE FEEL SHAH'S INTERESTS WOULD INCLUDE ALL OF FOLLOWING:</p>
                        <p>(A) ACCELERATION IN DELIVERY OF F-5E'S. START OF DELIVERIES IN APRIL 1973
                            WOULD BE IDEAL FROM POINT OF VIEW OF US INTERESTS HERE IN HELPING <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> BUILD EFFECTIVE FORCE AND FROM POINT OF
                            VIEW IRANIAN ABILITY TO ABSORB NEW AIRCRAFT. PLEASE INDICATE EARLIEST
                            ADVANCED DELIVERY DATE POSSIBLE FOR THESE PLANES.</p>
                        <p>(B) RAPID APPROVAL AND ASSIGNMENT OF TEMPORARY TEAMS OF US MILITARY
                            TECHNICIANS WHICH SHAH HWM REQUESTED FOR THREE SERVICES. WE UNDERSTAND
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> TASK FORCE IS NOW COMPLETING
                            STUDY OF THIS REQUEST AND THAT GROUP IS PLANNING TO VISIT TEHRAN FOR
                            FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. AS TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OUR RECEPROCAL WILLINGNESS TO
                            BE HELPFUL, WE RECOMMEND AMBASSADOR BE AUTHORIZED TO INFORM SHAH JOINT
                                STATE/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> TEAM WILL ARRIVE IN IRAN
                            FOR TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS ON HIS REQUEST WITHIN TWO WEEKS, AND THAT WE
                            WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO MEET HIS GOALS FOR ARRIVAL OF TECHNICIANS.</p>
                        <p>(C) AIR FORCE TRAINING. IRANIANS ARE KEENLY INTERESTED IN INCREASING
                            NUMBER OF SPACES AVAILABLE TO THEM IN TWO SCHOOLS. WE RECOMMEND IRANIAN
                            QUOTA AT AIR COMMAND AND STAFF SCHOOL BE INCREASED FROM ONE TO SIX
                            OFFICERS PER SESSION. SECONDLY, IRANIANS WOULD WELCOME ENLARGED QUOTA
                            FOR F-5E INSTRUCTOR TRAINING AT WILLIAMS FIELD. APPRECIATE ADVICE
                            WHETHER THESE TWO SUGGESTIONS ARE FEASIBLE.</p>
                        <p>4. TRANSFER OPERATIONS ARE TENATIVELY SLATED FOR AIR BASE REMOTE FROM
                            TEHRAN AND WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN THERE WILL BE NO PRESS LEAKAGE FROM
                            THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE LESS SURE OF OTHER NATIONS INVOLVED THIS PROJECT.
                            WOULD APPRECIATE CONTINGENCY PRESS GUIDANCE WE MAY SUPPLY TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> SHOULD STORY BREAK UNEXPECTEDLY.</p>

                            BE IN POSITION TO KEEP THEM ON IN IRAN TO FINISH THE JOB.</p>
                        <p>2. ACCORDINGLY AMBASSADOR SHOULD SEE SHAH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK
                            COMMITMENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL UP TO 16 AIRCRAFT. (FYI: EXACT NUMBER
                            DEPENDS UPON DISCUSSION NOW PROCEEDING WITH GRC AND WE CAN INFORM YOU OF
                            THIS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. YOU SHOULD NOT DELAY APPROACH TO SHAH FOR
                            THIS NUMBER. END FYI).</p>
                        <p>3. WITH RESPECT TO PARA 2A OF REF B, AND IN ADDITION TO POINTS YOU

                            ADVANCE SLIGHTLY DELIVERY DATE FOR F-4ES FROM JULY 73 TO AS EARLY AS MAY
                            73. IF YOU FEEL <pb n="2" xml:id="d229-02" facs="d229-02"/>THIS WOULD BE
                            USEFUL IN DEALING WITH SHAH. THIS SCHEDULE PREMISED ON PRODUCTION OF ONE
                            AIRCRAFT EACH IN APRIL AND IN MAY FOR 11AF. SECONDLY, YOU MAY TELL SHAH
                            THAT WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO CREDIT PRESENTLY LEASED 8 F-4E'S TO TOTAL
                            BUY OF F-4S FOR 11AF. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT PRESENT F-4E'S DO
                            NOT HAVE WING SLATS AND OTHER IMPROVED CHARACTERISTICS WHICH 1973
                            PRODUCTION LINE F-4E'S WILL HAVE. WE REGRET THAT AT THIS TIME WE ARE

                                also great. But this gives no occasion for a worshipful attitude on
                                our part. The Shah's interests and ours will be better served in the
                                long run by our looking dispassionately at the failures as well as
                                the success of the regime. That's what we are going to be doing.

                                Iran Novin party had won a sweeping victory over the Mardom party in
                                local elections, taking 80% of the vote. In Telegram 6210, October
                                14, the Embassy had written that the importance of the election
                                “lies not so much in Iran Novin victory, which observers already
                                knew would be the result, but in their significance as a training
                                vehicle in democratic forms.” (Ibid., Central Files, POL 18-1

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MJC3">Jack</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Many thanks for your letter of October 18 commenting on our pre-election
                            report — it's good to know that someone reads and thinks about the stuff
                            we send in.</p>
                        <p>A few more remarks on my part might be in order though, as I would like
                            to give you some idea of the thinking which led to our A-166 and
                            especially to the final sentence in the commentary.</p>
                        <p>First of all, the question of a functioning party system and electoral
                            process in Iran is tightly woven into the complex problem of a smooth
                            non-violent transition from an absolute monarch to a working
                            constitutional one; a social process which is far too involved for the
                            confines of this of this letter, but which will form the subject of a
                            future think piece. Viewing, insofar as is possible, the question of
                            parties and elections out of the above context, I would agree with you
                            that "form without content doesn't spell institution building in our
                            book" but the Shah is not writing our book — the volume he is compiling
                            is very definitely his own. He and his officials appear to believe
                            sincerely that they can create democratic forms, that the use of these
                            forms will have and educational effect on sizable segment of the
                            populace, and that the form can later be inflated with substance at a
                            time of the Shah's choosing and in a way which will allow of manageable
                            results. Of course, this is a delicate operation and the inflated
                            form-balloon could burst in the imperial face. Moreover, <pb n="2" xml:id="d230-02" facs="d230-02"/>fear of just such an explosion
                            might eventually prevent <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> from adding
                            content to democratic appearances. But even in their insubstantial
                            state, Iran's democratic forms serve a purpose; they aid the Shah in
                            impressing the foreign audience to which he so often plays.</p>
                        <p>Of course we agree, and we so stated in our airgram, that both the
                            politicians and the people perceive their electoral process accurately
                            and consequently regard it with cynicism and apathy. But we find it very
                            interesting that, after years of meek acceptance of tight election
                            controls, there is suddenly a flap among the very politicians whose
                            close acquaintance with Iranian elections leaves them with no illusions
                            as to its true nature.</p>
                        <p>There are at least two reasons for the flap and both of them appear to
                            stem from the influence and actions of dismissed Mardom Party
                            Secretary-General Ali Naqi Kani. In the first instance, Mardom, being a
                            traditional Iranian political party, is made up of cliques of followers
                            of a few competing leaders who cooperate with one another for personal
                            and pragmatic reasons but not out of any sense of party unity. Kani's
                            methods had made a number of enemies and with his fall his supporters
                            could expect to suffer. Under these circumstances, a clash within the
                            party is perfectly natural and much of what surfaced as committee
                            resignations and intemperate remarks is probably nothing more than the
                            visible portion of various personal power struggles.</p>
                        <p>But this accounts for only a part of the problem. Most of the attacks on
                                <persName corresp="#p_AY3">Adl</persName> have been voiced not in
                            terms of who gets what job; rather they have been focused in the main on
                            questions of collusion between the two parties, lackluster campaigning,
                            refusal to field candidates in certain elections and other activities
                            which have characterized Mardom campaigns in the past. It seems to us
                            that this dissatisfaction with a return to past policies is almost
                            entirely the result of Kani's stint in office. He appeared to believe
                            that he could become Prime Minister by making Mardon into an effective
                            opposition party. He was wrong, but in the course of his eighteen month
                            error he conducted what was for Iran a slashing, almost frenetic assault
                            on Iran Novin's administration of the government and, to a lesser
                            extent, on government polities. His tactics <pb n="3" xml:id="d230-03" facs="d230-03"/>appealed to the broad argumentative streak which
                            runs deep in the Persian people and may have awakened memories within
                            them of Iranian political parties as they used be. We said that this was
                            tentative but we continue to believe that included in Kani's legacy was
                            a feeling among his closer followers that an opposition party can and
                            should be a meaningful political vehicle and a sense of dismay when they
                            saw what they considered opportunities for change (as well as personal
                            aggrandizement) sidetracked by <persName corresp="#p_AY3">Adl</persName>.</p>
                        <p>This is the thinking that led up to our tentative statement that the
                            resignations appear to indicate a belief among those who resigned in the
                            need for a true opposition party. We recognize that the belief may not
                            last, in fact with Kani gone it would be surprising if it did. Moreover,
                            there are some vague signs that the Shah may be toying with the idea of
                            letting Mardom wither away a opting for a one-party system.</p>
                        <p>In any case we find the Mardom flareup interesting — even more so if our
                            interpretation is correct because it is precisely the kind of reaction
                            which we would not have predicted.</p>

                        <p>1. OWING TO URGENCY OF MY REQUEST, SHAH AGREED RECEIVE ME AT NIAVARAN
                            PALACE AT 1500 OCTOBER 31. OUR CONVERSATION LASTED 30 MINUTES.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH WAS DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE AND KIND
                            REMARKS WHICH I CONVEYED FROM WHITE HOUSE AND EMBASSY FOR HIS PROMPT
                            RESPONSE TO OUR FIRST REQUEST, AND FOR IIAF'S UNSTINTING COOPERATION IN
                            WORKING WITH DISASSEMBLY CREWS. OBSERVING THAT PROBLEM OF VIETNAM
                            SETTLEMENT INVOLVED NOT ONLY US BUT ENTIRE FREE WORLD, HE SAID IRAN
                            WANTED TO CONTRIBUTE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THAT GOAL DESPITE APPARENT
                            PROBLEMS CREATED BY HANOI OVER DATE OF SETTLEMENT SIGNING.</p>
                        <p>3. SHAH COMMENTED THAT HE HAD TWO CONCERNS IN TRANSFERRING ADDITIONAL
                            F-5S TO VIETNAM. FIRST HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIS OWN AIR SPACE. HE WAS
                            SURE THAT IRAQI INTELLIGENCE THROUGH INDIVIDUAL OR ELECTRONIC MEANS
                            WOULD SOON KNOW THAT F-5S HAD LEFT IRAN. SECONDLY, HE WAS QUOTE
                            SERIOUSLY CONCERNED UNQUOTE BECAUSE TRANSFER OF THE AIRCRAFT WOULD
                            DISRUPT HIS TRAINING PROGRAM AND ENTIRE CONCEPT OF IIAF WHICH WAS BEING
                            CONSTRUCTED WITH US ASSISTANCE AND BACKING. WITH TRANSFER OF F-5AS, HIS
                            PILOTS WOULD BE LEFT WITH LITTLE TO DO.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d231-02" facs="d231-02"/>
                        <p>4. SHAH SAID HE WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO SUPPLY UP TO 16 ADDITIONAL
                            PLANES. HOWEVER, BEFORE DOING SO, HE WISHED TO KNOW WHEN AND WITH WHAT
                            AIRCRAFT THEY WOULD BE REPLACED. HE SPECULATED THAT IF THE VIETNAM WAR
                            WERE TO BE OVER SOON, IT MIGHT BE THAT MORE F-4S WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE.
                            SHAH SAID IRAN WOULD ACCEPT F-4S AS REPLACEMENT FOR F-5S ON RATION TO BE
                            WORKED OUT LATER. QUOTE LET US SAY TWO F-5S FOR ONE F-4 UNQUOTE.</p>
                        <p>5. AT END OF CONVERSATION, SHAH ASKED THAT WE LET HIM KNOW AS SOON AS
                            POSSIBLE HOW WE WERE PREPARED TO SUPPLY HIS AIRCRAFT NEEDS, ADDING THAT
                            HE WAS PREPARED TO COOPERATE TO FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>6. DURING COURSE OF CONVERSATION, I LEFT PIECE OF PAPER LISTING FOLLOWING
                            POINTS:</p>
                        <p>A. DELIVERY OF F-5ES CAN BE ADVANCED TO AUGUST 1973. ORIGINAL DELIVERY
                            WAS SET FOR NOVEMBER 1973.</p>
                        <p>B. JOINT STATE/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> TEAM WILL VISIT IRAN
                            WITHIN NEXT TWO TO THREE WEEKS TO DISCUSS WITH EMBASSY AND <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ARRANGEMENTS FOR IRAN'S REQUESTED
                            BUILDUP IN US MILITARY TECHNICIANS FOR THREE SERVICES.</p>
                        <p>C. WHITE HOUSE HAS ASSURED US IRAN'S MILITARY SUPPORT NEEDS WILL BE GIVEN
                            "MOST EXPEDITIOUS HANDLING.”</p>
                        <p>D. IRANIAN AIR FORCE QUOTA AT AIR COMMAND AND STAFF SCHOOL WILL BE
                            INCREASED FROM ONE TO SIX OFFICERS PER SESSION.</p>
                        <p>E. ALL IRANIAN F-5E INSTRUCTOR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SATISFIED AT
                            WILLIAMS AIR FORCE BASE.</p>
                        <p>F. IF IRAN WISHES, WE ARE PREPARED TO CREDIT PRESENTLY LEASED EIGHT F-4ES
                            TO IRAN'S TOTAL BUY OF THOSE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER, LEASED PLANES DO NOT
                            HAVE WING SLATS ORDERED BY IIAF ON NEW F-4ES.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d231-03" facs="d231-03"/>
                        <p>7. IT IS CLEAR THAT DURING FIRST ROUND OF DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT,
                            SHAH ACTED ON FAITH IN AGREEING TO OUR REQUEST. NOW THAT WE ARE PRESSING
                            HARD ON HIS AIR FORCE BY REQUESTING ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT, HE NATURALLY
                            WISHES KNOW HOW HIS OWN SECURITY REQUIREMENTS WILL BE MET. IN ORDER THAT
                            HE RELEASE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT, WE WILL HAVE TO OFFER HIM SOMETHING MORE
                            ATTRACTIVE IN THE WAY OF EARLY F-5E OR F-4E DELIVERIES THAN WE HAVE BEEN
                            AUTHORIZED TO DATE. TRANSFERRING EIGHT LEASED F-4S SHOULD NOT BE
                            CONSTRUED AS REDUCTION IN TOTAL NUMBER OF F-4ES IRAN HAS ORDERED.</p>
                        <p>8. BELIEVE WE SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO RECIPROCATE SHAH'S GENEROUS
                            OFFER WITH EQUALLY GENEROUS CREDIT FOR TRANSFERRED AIRCRAFT AND SPECIAL
                            MEASURES TO DELIVER REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.</p>

                        <p>1. WE WELCOME OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMININ FURTHER, AS SUGGESTED IN REF (A),
                            HOW WE CAN CONSTRUCTIVELY RESPOND TO SHAH'S MAGNANIMOUS ACTION IN
                            SUPPORTING OUR EFFORTS IN VIETNAM FOR PEACE SETTLEMENT. OUR VIEWS WILL
                            BE SUBMITTED SHORTLY IN SEPTEL.</p>
                        <p>2. HOWEVER, WE HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WHICH IS TO RESTORE ATMOSPHERE
                            AND SPIRIT OF GOOD WILL AND COOPERATION GENERATED BY SHAH'S FORTHCOMING
                            RESPONSE TO OUR REQUEST, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN BADLY SHATTERED BY WHAT
                            FROM HERE APPEARS TO BE ASTONISHING VIOLATION OF SHAH'S CONFIDENCE AND
                            UNDERSTANDING WE HAD URGED ON THE SHAH REGARDING SECURITY ASPECTS OF
                            THIS EXERCISE.</p>
                        <p>3. MESSAGES FROM WASHINGTON ON THIS SUBJECT HAVE STRESSED HIGHLY,
                            CLASSIFIED NATURE OF THIS OPERATION AND HAVE INSTRUCTED US TO IMPRESS
                            UPON SHAH AND IRANIAN AUTHORITIES THAT MATTER BE CLOSELY HELD. SHAH AND
                            GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_KGM2">KHATAMI</persName> OF IIAF READ AND

                            PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN OPERATION.</p>
                        <p>4. IN ADDITION, WE CONVEYED TO APPROPRIATE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES PRESS
                            GUIDANCE SET FORTH IN STATE 195418 WHICH IN VIEW OF TIGHT SECURITY OF
                            THIS EXERCISE WE SAID WOULD HOLD UNTIL WE WERE NOTIFIED OTHERWISE. ON
                            BASIS OF EXPERIENCE HERE IN THDLE MATTERS WE WERE REASONABLY SATISFIED
                            THAT OPERATION ENHANCE PLUSE WOULD NOT SURFACE IN PRESS HERE, BUT WE
                            REMAINED CONERNED IN THIS ASPECT OF OPERATION BECAUSE, AS SHAH HAS
                            MENTIONED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION IN RECENT YEARS, "WE CAN MAINTAIN
                            YOUR SECURITY, BUT CAN YOU?”</p>
                        <p>5. QUESTION ON SECURITY OF OPERATION ENHANCE PLUS AROSE LATE EVENING
                            FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, WHEN ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM <pb n="2" xml:id="d232-02" facs="d232-02"/> SHAH COURT MINISTER ALAM CALLED AMBASSADOR
                            REGARDING REPORT SHAH HAD JUST RECEIVED TO EFFECT NEWS REPORT ABOUT THIS
                            OPERATION BREAKING IN WASHINGTON. ALAN WANTED AMBASSADOR TO KNOW SHAH
                            WAS GREATLY DISTURBED OVER THIS DEVELOPMENT WHICH HE ASSUMED WAS BASED
                            ON LEAK. AMBASSADOR INFORMED ALAM THAT AS FAR AS WE KNEW, PRESS GUIDANCE
                            AS OUTLINED STATE 195418 REMAINED IN EFFECT AND, FURTHER, WE HAD NO
                            REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON TO SUGGEST ANY CHANGE. ALAM CALLED BACK SHORTLY
                            THEREAFTER TO REPORT THAT SHAH HAD DECIDED NOT PURSUE MATTER AT THAT
                            TIME WITH ANY ANNOUNCEMENT BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            BECAUSE HE DID NOT WISH TO REACT TO WHAT WAS STILL UNCONFIRMED AND
                            POSSIBLY TENDACIOUS PRESS REPORTS.</p>
                        <p>6. WE ARE SPELLING THIS OUT AS BACKGROUND TO EXPLAIN OUR SHOCK AND
                            CONSTERNATION IN FINDING IN MORNING NOVEMBER 4 TRAFFIC ROUTINE
                            UNCLASSIFIED MESSAGES INDICATING THAT IRAN'S ROLE IN OPERATION ENHANCE
                            PLUS AND THAT OF SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES WAS ANNOUNCED BY OFFICIAL
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> SPOKESMAN WITHOUT ANY PRIOR
                            CONSULTATION WITH IRAN OR WARNING TO US. AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE SEEKING
                            STRENGTHEN SENSE OF COLLABORATION IN OUR MILITARY AND OTHER RELATIONS
                            WITH IRAN AND SUCCESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY SHAH'S FORTHCOMING RESPONSE
                            TO OUR REQUEST FOR HELP ON F-5 MATTER, AND FURTHER WHEN WE ARE CURRENTLY
                            SEEKING WAYS TO RESPOND TO SHAH'S HELPFUL ACTION, WE ARE NOW PLACED IN
                            EXTREMELY AWKWARD POSITION OF HAVING IN EFFECT VIOLATED UNILATERALLY
                            CONFIDENCE WE URGED UPON SHAH AND WITH WHICH HE READILY AGREED. SHAH,
                            WHO IS SENSITIVE ABOUT THESE MATTERS, CAN BE EXPECTED TAKE THIS AS
                            PERSONAL AFFRONT. AS BUT ONE INDICATION OF STORM WE FACE ON THIS MATTER,
                            DCM, IN ABSENCE OF AMBASSADOR WHO OUT OF TEHRAN TODAY WITH SHAH FOR
                            INAUGURAL CEREMONIES, WAS CALLED URGENTLY TO MFA AND ASKED ABOUT WHAT
                            WAS DESCRIBED AS "VERY UNFORTUNATE COMMENTS BY DOD SPOKESMEN WITH
                            EXTREMELY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR IRAN.”</p>
                        <p>7. IN SHORT, AFTER BENIFITING FROM IRAN'S SENSE OF COOPERATION WE HAVE
                            TURNED AROUND AND PUT THIS COUNTRY ON SPOT. AS MATTER OF UTMOST
                            IMPORTANCE AND URGENCY WE REQUEST CLARIFICATION OF WHAT FACTORS PROMPTED
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> TO DEPART FROM ACCEPTED PRESS

                            PUBLICLY MENTION IRAN'S ROLE IN F-5 TRANSFER TO VIETNAM. WE ALSO REQUEST
                            HAVING ALL OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS BEARING ON MATTER SO THAT WE CAN GIVE
                            SHAH AS CREDIBLE EXPLANATION AS POSSIBLE FOR WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
                            INCREDIBLE GOOF.</p>
                        <p>8. IN MEANTIME, IN ANSWER TO PRESS INQUIRIES WE ARE TAKING LINE THAT WE
                            KNOW NOTHING MORE THAN WAS RELEASED IN WASHINGTON AND THAT LOCAL

                            THANKS FOR HIS COOPERATION IN SUPPORTING OUR EFFORTS TO FIND PEACE
                            SETTLEMENT IN VIETNAM, TO ASSURE HIM THAT HIS HELP IN TIME OF NEED WILL

                            BOTH US INTERESTS AND US/IRAN RELATIONS. GIVEN LIMITED DISTRIBUTION OF
                            THESE MESSAGES AND HIGH CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECT, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW
                            BEST TO CONVEY OUR COMMENDATION AND CONGRATULATIONS, AND APPRECIATE
                            RECIPIENTS THIS MESSAGE SEEING THAT THIS GETS TO RIGHT PEOPLE.</p>
                        <p>3. NOW THAT THIS PHASE OF OPERATION ENHANCE PLUS APPEARS TO BE
                            SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED AND WHILE EXERCISE REMAINS ACTIVELY ON FRONT
                            BURNER AND VERY MUCH IN SHAH'S MIND, WE STRONGLY URGE THAT WE COME UP AS
                            SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL TO CREDIT SHAH FOR 32
                            AIRCRAFT HE HAS MADE AVAILABLE. WE WELCOME OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED IN STATE
                            199893 TO RETHINK ELEMENTS OF PACKAGE WE SHOULD PUT TO SHAH. OUR
                            THOUGHTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d233-02" facs="d233-02"/>
                        <p>(A) FIRST WE URGE LETTER FROM PRESIDENT TO SHAH WHICH WOULD INCORPORATE
                            POINTS OUTLINED IN PARA ONE, WITH EXCEPTION OF REFERENCE TO PRESS FLAP
                            WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS BEEN CONTAINED AND WHICH WE DO NOT THINK NEED BE
                            PART OF A PRESIDENTIAL LETTER. WE URGE SUCH A LETTER BE SENT TO SHAH
                            BECAUSE OF CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRESIDENT AND SHAH WHICH
                            UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION WAS REASON WHICH LED SHAH
                            TO RESPOND SO GENEROUSLY AND PROMPTLY TO OUR REQUEST.</p>
                        <p>(B) WE IMPLEMENT PROPOSALS ALREADY PUT TO SHAH AS OUTLINED IN PARA SIX
                            TEHRAN 6520 TO INSURE THAT:</p>
                        <p>(1) DELIVERY OF F-5E'S BE ADVANCED TO START AUGUST 1973;</p>
                        <p>(2) JOINT STATE/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> TEAM VISIT IRAN TO
                            DISCUSS BUILD-UP OF MILITARY PERSONNEL HERE. IN THIS CONNECTION STATE
                            201954 IS VERY HELPFUL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ARRIVAL OF TEAM IN LATE
                            NOVEMBER.</p>
                        <p>(3) WE GIVE IRAN'S MILITARY SUPPORT NEEDS EXPEDITIOUS HANDLING. AS ONE
                            ELEMENT OF THIS ASPECT OF OUR MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN VISIT OF
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> TEAM CHAIRED BY L.A. ALNE OF
                            OSAA HAS BEEN EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND IS EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN
                            CONTRIBUTE CONSTRUCTIVELY TO INCREASINGLY CLOSE MILITARY COOPERATION
                            WITH IRAN AS WELL AS HELPING US SIGNIFICANTLY IN OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
                            PROBLEMS;</p>
                        <p>(4) INCREASE <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> QUOTA AT AIR COMMAND
                            AND STAFF SCHOOL FROM ONE TO SIX OFFICERS PER SESSION;</p>
                        <p>(5) SATISFY ALL IRANIAN F-5E INSTRUCTIONAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AT
                            WILLIAMS AIR FORCE BASE; AND</p>
                        <p>(6) IF IRAN WISHES, CREDIT PRESENTLY RELEASED EIGHT F-4E'S TO IRAN'S
                            TOTAL BUY OF THOSE AIRCRAFT.</p>
                        <p>4. ALL OF FOREGOING HELPS SUBSTANTIALLY TO STRENGTHEN PACKAGE WE WILL BE
                            PUTTING TO SHAH AS CREDIT FOR 32 F5A'S. AS HELPFUL AS IT IS, IT STILL
                            DOES NOT RPT NOT ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
                            WRESTLING AND WHICH IS BROUGHT ABOUT <pb n="3" xml:id="d233-03" facs="d233-03"/>BY MAJOR GAP CREATED IN IIAF'S INVENTORY BY RELEASE
                            OF 32 F5A'S. THIS PROBLEM HAS WEIGHED ON SHAH'S MIND BECAUSE HE IS
                            CONCERNED ABOUT HIS NATIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND IT HAS BEEN
                            FURTHER COMPLICATED BY PRESS LEAK WHICH SHAH BELIEVES HAS BEARING ON
                            IRAN'S SECURITY. OVER WEEKEND AT INAUGURAL CEREMONY IN SOUTH IRAN SHAH
                            TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT NOW THAT WORLD KNEW THAT IRAN'S AIR FORCE
                            CAPABILITY HAD BEEN REDUCED BY RELEASE OF F-5 AIRCRAFT, IT WAS MORE
                            IMPERATIVE THAN EVER THAT THESE F-5A'S BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
                            SHAH SAID IRAN'S AIR SPACE MUST NOT BE LEFT UNCOVERED AND WHILE HE
                            AGREED REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT SHOULD BE PHASED IN IN ORDERLY MANNER,
                            PROCESS SHOULD START PROMPTLY. REVERTING TO FORMULA OUTLINED IN PARA
                            FOUR OF TEHRAN 6520, SHAH AGAIN SUGGESTED THAT F-5'S BE REPLACED BY
                            F-4'S WITH EXACT RATION SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>5. GIVEN SHAH'S CONCERN, WE DO NOT THINK THAT SHAH WILL FIND ATTRACTIVE
                            SUGGESTIONS IN EARLIER MESSAGES FROM WASHINGTON THAT IRAN RECEIVE
                            FINANCIAL CREDIT FOR F-5A'S IT HAS RELEASED. AS SHAH HAS CONSISTENTLY
                            SAID FROM OUTSET (REF PARA 7 TEHRAN 6317), HE HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH
                            REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT, NOT CREDIT, AND HIS AGREEMENT TO RELEASE 32 F-5A'S
                            WAS SUBJECT TO EARLY REPLACEMENT.</p>
                        <p>6. FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SAME REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT PROPOSAL IN STATE
                            199893 TO RETURN F-5A'S FROM VIETNAM IS NON-STARTER. IRANIANS WOULD HAVE
                            JUSTIFIABLE APPREHENSION AS TO OPERATING CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS OF
                            CLIMATE AND SVN MAINTENANCE OF AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, BY TIME F-5A'S
                            WOULD BE RETURNING THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE PHASED OUT OF IIAF INVENTORY
                            WHICH IS CONVERTING TO F-5E MODELS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, MOVEMENT OF F-5
                            AIRCRAFT HAS NEVER BEEN PRESENTED TO SHAH AS LOAN TO SVN BUT RATHER AS
                            TRANSFER WHICH WILL BE COMPENSATED IN SOME FORM BY <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. AFTER OUR FAILURE TO ADVISE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> PRIOR TO MAKING PUBLIC STATEMENT ON
                            IRAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN EXERCISE, IT WOULD SEVERLY TEST SHAH'S CONFIDENCE
                            IN <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IF WE NOW INFORM SHAH THAT
                            TRANSFER WAS IN FACT LOAN OF AIRCRAFT WHICH HE WILL BE GETTING BACK. WE
                            CONCLUDE FROM THIS THAT IF WE ARE NOT TO FORGET SHAH'S HELP IN TIME OF
                            NEED WE MUST FOCUS ON REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT IN ADDITION TO OFFERS
                            ENUMERATED IN PARA 3(8) ABOVE. BEST WAY TO RESPOND TO SHAH IS TO ADVANCE
                            DELIVERY DATE OF F-5E'S AND F-4E'S WHICH IRAN HAS ON ORDER.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d233-04" facs="d233-04"/>
                        <p>5. FINALLY, WE RECOMMEND AMBASSADOR BE AUTHORIZED TO TELL SHAH <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAS APPROVED MAVERICK MISSILE FOR
                            RELEASE TO IRAN AND WE WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO INSURE THAT NEW F-4'S
                            FOR IRAN ARE EQUIPPED WITH WEAPON AND F-4'S NOW IN IIAF INVENTORY
                            RETROFITTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ASSURANCES ON MAVERICK MAY HELP
                            ALLEVIATE SECURITY CONCERNS SHAH FEELS WITH TRANSFER OF F-5A'S.</p>

                            TO ATTEMPT TO PUT PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT OVER THE NEXT

                            SUFFICIENT TO MAKE UP FOR ANY GAP RESULTING FROM TRANSFER OF 32 F-5A
                            AIRCRAFT TO SVN.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d234-02" facs="d234-02"/>
                        <p>3. IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD BETWEEN PRESENT AND END <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74, WE SEE TWO POSSIBLE AREAS WHICH MIGHT
                            CONCERN <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>: (1) DEVELOPMENT OF IRAQI
                            AIR FORCE AND (2) INSTABILITY ON "EASTERN BORDERS" PARTICULARLY IN
                            PAKISTAN.</p>
                        <p>4. WITH RESPECT TO DEVELOPMENT OF IRAQI AIR CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT
                            OVER THE TIME PERIOD NOTED ABOVE, THE PRINCIPAL FACTOR GOVERNING IRAQI
                            CAPABILITIES WILL BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PROFICIENT
                            PILOTS, AIR CREW AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL. THE SHAH HIMSELF IS WELL
                            AWARE OF THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THESE FACTORS FROM EXPERIENCE WITH HIS
                            OWN AIR FORCE. WHILE WE CAN MAKE NO FIRM PREDICTIONS ABOUT FUTURE
                            DELIVERIES OF SOVIET-SUPPLIED EQUIPMENT TO IRAQ, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE
                            WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN IRAQI AIR FORCE PERSONNEL CAPABILITIES
                            WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO HEIGHTENED CONCERN ON PART OF IRAN IN THIS PERIOD.
                            BY LATE 1974 IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO MAKE FIRM PREDICTIONS, BUT IIAF
                            SHOULD BE IN SUFFICIENTLY GOOD CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO AIRCRAFT AT
                            THAT TIME AS TO CAUSE NO SERIOUS CONCERN ON PART OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ABOUT IRAQ AIR CAPABILITIES. IN
                            ADDITION YOU MIGHT NOTE THAT WE BELIEVE ANY IRAQI DISPOSITION TOWARDS
                            ADVENTURISM OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS IS SERIOUSLY CURTAILED BY ITS HEIGHTENED
                            PREOCCUPATION WITH THE KURDISH PROBLEM, INFIGHTING BETWEEN SADDAM AND
                            HIS RIVALS, GROWING BUDGETARY PROBLEMS BROUGHT ON BY OIL NATIONALIZATION
                            AND REDUCED REVENUES, AND A RUNNING DISPUTE WITH SYRIA OVER TAPLINE
                            REVENUES.</p>
                        <p>5. AS YOU ARE PERSONALLY AWARE, IT MOST DIFFICULT TO MAKE PREDICTIONS
                            ABOUT FUTURE OF EVENTS IN SUB-CONTINENT. HOWEVER, BOTH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> AND MRS. GANDHI REMAIN PUBLICLY
                            COMMITTED TO THE SIMLA AGREEMENT AND, DESPITE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES, A
                            DIALOGUE CONTINUES BETWEEN THEIR GOVERNMENTS ON MEANS TO IMPLEMENT STEPS
                            UNDER THAT AGREEMENT THAT COULD LAY THE BASIS FOR A NEW AND PEACEFUL
                            ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN. MOREOVER, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAS RECENTLY WORKED OUT
                            AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION ON THE OUTLINE OF A
                            NEW CONSTITUTION, A DEVELOPMENT WITH IMPORTANT POSSIBILITIES FOR GREATER
                            POLITICAL STABILITY IN PAKISTAN. THIS PROMISES ALSO TO GIVE HIM SOME
                            GREATER FLEXIBILITY ON THE ISSUE OF BANGLADESH RECOGNITION AND THE
                            SUBSEQUENT STEPS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH AN AMICABLE GOP/BDG RELATIONSHIP.
                            HENCE WE FEEL THERE IS MINIMAL REASON TO BE DISQUIETED ABOUT SITUATION
                            ON IRAN'S EASTERN BORDERS AND INDEED WE BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT
                            EVIDENCE TO ASSUME A MORE <pb n="3" xml:id="d234-03" facs="d234-03"/>OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK. WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT RESIDUAL TENSION IN
                            PAKISTAN COULD THREATEN ITS INTERNAL STABILITY, AND PERHAPS EVEN LEAD TO
                            ARMED DISSIDENCE, SUCH A SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN
                            INCREASED AIR THREAT TO IRAN OR AFFECT IIAF AIR SUPERIORITY IN THE
                            REGION.</p>
                        <p>6. NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES TO PROVIDE
                            SHAH WITH ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES OVER THE PERIOD OF INCREASED CONCERN.
                            YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF OUR EFFORT TO MOVE F-5E DELIVERIES FORWARD IN
                            TIME TO AUGUST 1973, OUR MOVING AHEAD ON AN EARLY BASIS TO PROVIDE
                            ADDITIONAL MILITARY PERSONNEL, OUR EARLIER AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL
                            TOUFANIAN TO MOVE UP DELIVERY DATES FOR F-4E'S, AND THE PROVISION OF
                            VARIOUS TRAINING AND INSTRUCTOR SPACES IN U.S. FOR IIAF. IN ADDITION TO
                            THE ABOVE, YOU MAY TELL SHAH THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            HAS APPROVED MAVERICK MISSILE FOR RELEASE TO IRAN, WITH FIRST DELIVERIES
                            IN SPRING OF FY 1974, IF YOU BELIEVE IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO
                            RESOLVE PROBLEMS RAISED BY COURT MINISTER ALAM.</p>
                        <p>7. FYI. IF YOU THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL, WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO CONSIDER
                            AUTHORIZING YOU TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE
                            PROVISION OF F-5A AIRCRAFT TO VIETNAM BY OTHER COUNTRIES AND U.S.
                            RECIPROCAL GESTURES. IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO DO THIS, PLEASE
                            CABLE YOUR ASSESSMENT OF SHAH'S EXPECTED REACTION SO THAT WE CAN CONFIRM
                            OUR ASSESSMENT HERE. BOTH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND THE REPUBLIC OF
                            CHINA AGREED TO PROVIDE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO SOUTH
                            VIETNAM, 36 AND 48 F-5A'S RESPECTIVELY. IN EACH CASE, WE ALSO MADE A
                            CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE AIR DEFENSE NEEDS IN THE REGION AND WHAT WE
                            COULD OR SHOULD DO TO PROVIDE FOR ANY GAP WHICH MIGHT DEVELOP. IN KOREA,
                            OUR ASSESSMENT WAS THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF SO MANY AIRCRAFT IN THE
                            MIDDLE OF A PERIOD OF GREAT CHANGE AND WITH DISCUSSIONS CONTINUING
                            BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
                            SOMETHING IN PLACE IN RETURN TO GUARD AGAINST AN AIR DEFENSE GAP. WE
                            THEREFORE OFFERED TO PROVIDE TWO U.S. AIR FORCE F-4 SQUADRONS, OR
                            ALTERNATIVELY A LEASE OF 18 F-4D AIRCRAFT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA. THE
                            LATER WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE RETURN TO THE U.S. OF F-4 AIRCRAFT ON
                            LEASE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH HAD DECIDED TO TERMINATE THE LEASE OF
                            AIRCRAFT UPON ACCEPTANCE OF ANOTHER, EARLIER ORDERED AND MORE MODERN
                            AIRPLANE FROM U.S. PRODUCTION. THE KOREANS CHOSE THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE
                            THEREBY ABSORBING THE ONLY F-4 AIRCRAFT WE HAD AVAILABLE FOR LEASE. IN
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d234-04" facs="d234-04"/>FACT A NUMBER OF THESE
                            AIRCRAFT HAD TO COME FROM OUR REGULAR AIR FORCE INVENTORY WHICH IS
                            ALREADY HEAVILY PRESSED BY ITS COMMITMENTS TO VIETNAM AND WORLDWIDE. THE
                            REPUBLIC OF CHINA ACCEPTED THE STATIONING ON ITS TERRITORY OF TWO U.S.
                            AIR FORCE F-4 SQUADRONS TO COVER THE AIR DEFENSE GAP WHICH WE BELIEVED
                            WOULD OCCUR THERE. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE NOT FIGURED PROMINENTLY
                            IN PRESS COVERAGE, WE ANTICIPATE THEY WILL OVER TIME BECOME PUBLIC AND
                            YOU SHOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATION ABOUT THEIR USE WITH THE SHAH ON THAT
                            BASIS. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>8. WE HAVE ALSO EXAMINED AGAIN THE PROBLEM RAISED BY THE NECESSITY OF
                            SHOWING RECIPROCAL CONSIDERATION TO THE SHAH FOR THE RELEASE OF THE 32
                            F-5A AIRCRAFT TO THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO HELP MEET
                            VIETNAMESE DEFENSE NEEDS IN CONTEXT OF AN HONORABLE AND ENDURING PEACE
                            SETTLEMENT. REFERENCED MESSAGES INDICATE THAT (A) SHAH IS INTERESTED IN
                            REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT ONLY, NOT DOLLAR CREDIT; (B) RETURN OF F-5A'S FROM
                            VIETNAM TO IRAN IS "NON-STARTER,” (C) IRAN WOULD ACCEPT F-4E AS
                            REPLACEMENT FOR F-5A, AND SUGGESTS ONE F-4 FOR TWO F-5A; AND (D) YOUR
                            BELIEF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> APPROVAL OF RELEASE OF
                            MAVERICK FOR IRAN MAY HELP ALLEVIATE SECURITY CONCERNS SHAH FEELS WITH
                            TRANSFER OF F-5A'S.</p>
                        <p>9. THE 32 F-5A AIRCRAFT WERE GIVEN TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> BY THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AS <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> GRANT <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> AT A COST OF 24.9 MILLION DOLLARS, OR AN AVERAGE UNIT
                            PRICE OF 778,000 DOLLARS. TWENTY-EIGHT OF THE F-5A'S ARE FIVE TO EIGHT
                            YEARS OLD AND FOUR ARE THREE TO FIVE YEARS OLD. FROM A PRICING
                            STANDPOINT, BASED ON <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> CRITERIA, THE
                            32 F-5A'S HAVE A CURRENT VALUE OF 11.6 MILLION DOLLARS, OR 362,500
                            DOLLARS AVERAGE UNIT PRICE. A NEW F-4E AIRCRAFT HAS A UNIT PRICE OF 3.7
                            MILLION DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>10. IN TEHRAN 6346 YOU RECOGNIZED OUR "THORNY LEGAL AND BUDGETING
                            PROBLEMS" AND STATED, "EIGHT F-4E'S ARE PRESENTLY LEASED TO IRANIAN AIR
                            FORCE. WE COULD OFFER TO TRANSFER TITLE ON THESE PLANES TO GOI,
                            CREDITING PORTION OF VALUE OF TRANSFERRED F-5A'S.” WE ARE PREPARED TO
                            TRANSFER TITLE TO EIGHT LEASED F-4E'S TO GOI UNDER ARRANGEMENT WHICH
                            WILL IN EFFECT BE WITHOUT COST TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.
                            THIS WOULD BE DONE IN FOLLOWING MANNER IN ORDER TO SATISFY U.S. LEGAL
                            REQUIREMENTS:</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WOULD SIGN FOREIGN MILITARY SALES
                            CONTRACT (I.E., FMS LETTER OF OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE, DD FORM 15123)
                            AGREEING TO PURCHASE THE EIGHT F-4E AIRCRAFT AT DEPRECIATED UNIT PRICE
                            OF 2,070,500 DOLLARS; TOTAL PRICE 16,564,000 DOLLARS.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d234-05" facs="d234-05"/>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CONCURRENTLY WOULD SIGN FOREIGN
                            MILITARY SALES CONTRACT AMENDMENTS WHICH WOULD REFLECT FIRM PRICE
                            REDUCTIONS AGAINST SEVERAL SALES PREVIOUSLY CONSUMMATED. THESE REDUCTION
                            AMENDMENTS WOULD TOTAL 16,564,000 DOLLARS. THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM
                            REDUCTIONS INVOLVED ARE:</p>
                        <p>(1) 73 F-4E AIRCRAFT, SOLD DEC. 70, REDUCED IN PRICE BY TOTAL OF
                            4,672,000 DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>(2) 36 F-4E AIRCRAFT, SOLD OCT. 72 REDUCED IN PRICE BY TOTAL OF 2,304,000
                            DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>(3) 36 F-T5E AIRCRAFT, SOLD FEB. 72, REDUCED IN PRICE BY TOTAL OF
                            2,448,000 DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>(4) 105 F-5E AIRCRAFT, SOLD JULY 72, REDUCED IN PRICE BY TOTAL OF
                            7,140,000 DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WOULD BE BILLED FOR THE EIGHT
                            F-4E'S AFTER TRANSFER TO IRANIAN OWNERSHIP. BILLINGS AGAINST THE REDUCED
                            PROGRAMS WOULD OF COURSE BE ADJUSTED TO OFFSET THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE
                            BILLING FOR THE EIGHT F-4E'S.</p>
                        <p>D. THE <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> LEASE WOULD BE CANCELLED
                            WITHOUT COST TO THE GOI. AS WE SEE IT HERE, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR
                            YOU TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PRICE REDUCTIONS OUTLINED ABOVE ARE A FIRM
                            SAVING TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, AND NOT JUST A
                            "SLEIGHT OF HAND" MANEUVER. THE METHODOLOGY IS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH
                            EXISTING U.S. LAW.</p>
                        <p>11. FYI. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE FOUR CONTRACTS ASSOCIATED
                            WITH THE ABOVE PROGRAM REDUCTIONS ARE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF ESTIMATED
                            COSTS. ACTUAL COSTS WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL FINAL CLOSING OF THE CASES.
                            AS A CONSEQUENCE A "FIRM" REDUCTION OF 16.6 MILLION DOLLARS MAY BE
                            SUBSEQUENTLY MASKED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FINAL CONTRACT COSTS SO THAT
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE
                            THAT OUR "FIRM" REDUCTION ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE. YOU SHOULD REASSURE SHAH
                            THAT THE 16.6 MILLION DOLLARS IS IN FACT A REAL ABSORPTION BY THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> OF REAL COSTS WHICH WOULD, IN ABSENCE

                        <p>Have read Tehran 6849 and State 210666. I recognize that intelligence
                            appraisal in latter will not be of much help to you in the circumstances
                            and I hold no brief for its tone. Equipment proposals, however, seem
                            steps in right direction but recognize they may not be enough. There are
                            further steps which may be possible, but they would be extremely
                            difficult. Therefore, I will appreciate knowing whether you feel offers
                            described in State 210666 will accomplish the purpose and be seen by
                            Shah as good faith on U.S. part. Assume it is the substance of the offer
                            you are more concerned with than having someone from Washington to
                            present it.</p>

                        <p>FOR UNDERSECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">JOHNSON</persName> FROM AMBASSADOR</p>
                        <p>1. WE APPRECIATE CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND DESIRE TO BE FORTHCOMING WHICH WENT
                            INTO PREPARATION OF REFTEL. HOWEVER, TO BE BLUNT, THE ESSENTIAL POINT
                            HAS BEEN MISSED. SHAH'S QUICK AGREEMENT TO TRANSFER 32 F-5S WAS "SUBJECT
                            TO EARLY REPLACEMENT." (TEHRAN 6317, PARA 7). HE DID NOT SEEK TO
                            BARGAIN. HE DID NOT DEMAND TO KNOW DATE OF ARRIVAL OF REPLACEMENT
                            AIRCRAFT. HE TOOK FOR GRANTED WE WOULD FIND WAY TO PROVIDE EARLY
                            REPLACEMENTS. SHAH HAS REPEATEDLY STRESSED DESIRE FOR EARLY
                            REPLACEMENTS, BUT REFTEL SUGGESTS OUR IMPLICIT ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
                            COMMITMENT HAS SOMEHOW BEEN LOST. </p>
                        <p>2. WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN ACCEPTING REFTEL'S INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE OF
                            IRAN'S CONTINUING MILITARY SUPERIORITY OVER IRAQ AND ITS EASTERN
                            NEIGHBORS AND ASSESSMENTS REGARDING TREND OF EVENTS IN SUBCONTINENT.
                            HOWEVER, SHAH HAS COMPLETELY OPPOSITE VIEW. HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF
                            AUTHORITY ON ASSESSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS PART OF WORLD, AND
                            UNDERSTANDABLY BELIEVES HE SHOULD BASE DECISIONS REGARDING HIS SECURITY
                            REQUIREMENTS ON PESSIMISTIC RATHER THAN OPTIMISTIC VIEWS OF TRENDS THAT
                            BEAR DIRECTLY ON IRAN'S SECURITY. FOR EXAMPLE, HE HOPES PAKISTAN WILL
                            EMERGE FROM ITS PRESENT TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS INTACT WITH REASONABLE
                            PROSPECT FOR NATIONAL UNITY AND VIABILITY. BUT HE FEELS HE MUST PLAN HIS
                            SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ON EASTERN FRONTIERS ON POSSIBLE BREAK-UP. OF
                            PAKISTAN AND MAJOR THREAT TO PEACE IN AREA THAT THIS WOULD POSE.</p>
                        <p>3. ON IRAQI THREAT, NOV 19 NEWS ITEM IN NEW YORK TIMES THAT IRAQ AS
                            SECOND LARGEST RECIPIENT OF SOVIET MILITARY AID IN 1971, AHEAD OF INDIA
                            WILL BE FAR MORE PERSUASIVE TO SHAH THAN POINTS IN PARA 4 OF REFTEL, NO
                            MATTER HOW PERTINENT AND ACCURATE THEY MAY BE.</p>
                        <p> 4. IN ANY EVENT, WHATEVER VALIDITY OF OUR ESTIMATES IN REFTEL, WE DO NOT
                            BELIEVE USEFUL PURPOSE WOULD BE SERVED BY DEBATING THEM WITH SHAH
                            BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT AGREE AND WOULD PROBABLY SEE THIS AS ATTEMPT TO
                            PERSUADE HIM TO ACCEPT A LINE OF REASONING AS JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING
                            WITHOUT 32 AIRCRAFT HE THINKS HE NEEDS AND LACK OF WHICH HAS WEAKENED
                            HIS AIR FORCE. WERE SHAH TO ACCEPT OUR LINE OF REASONING, PRESUMABLY HE
                            WOULD HAVE LESS REASON TO ORDER 2.5 BILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY
                            EQUIPMENT FROM US THIS FISCAL YEAR. WE SIMPLY CANNOT TURN ON "NO THREAT"
                            ARGUMENT WHEN IT SUITS OUR PURPOSE AND IGNORE IT WHEN SALES COME UP. </p>
                        <p>5. BASIC POINT IN ALL THIS IS THAT DAYS WHEN WE SECOND-GUESS SHAH NATURE
                            OF THREAT OR HIS NEEDS FOR MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO MEET THREAT ARE OVER.
                            SHAH IS MAKING HIS OWN DECISIONS AND IS PAYING HIS OWN WAY. HE IS
                            DETERMINED TO BE AS SELF-SUFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE,
                            AND HE HAS RESOURCES TO PURSUE HIS PRESENT GUNS AND BUTTER POLICY. AS HE
                            SEES IT, HE HELPED US OUT IN OUR MOMENT OF NEED EVEN THOUGH THIS
                            WEAKENED HIM MILITARILY. IN SPIRIT IN WHICH MATTER WAS NEGOTIATED HE
                            ASSUMES WE WILL MAKE GOOD ON OUR COMMITMENT ON "EARLY REPLACEMENT" SO
                            THAT HE IS NOT VULNERABLE MILITARILY FOR TOO LONG A PERIOD.</p>
                        <p>6. NOT BEING PRIVY TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH KOREA AND TAIWAN, NOR INFORMED ON
                            SERIOUSNESS OF THREAT CONFRONTING THEM, WE ARE RELUCTANT TO MAKE
                            JUDGMENT ON MORE ATTRACTIVE QUID PRO QUOS WHICH USG HAS AFFORDED THEM.
                            BUT WHEN PROVISIONS BECOME KNOWN, WE FEEL CERTAIN SHAH WILL BELIEVE THEY
                            MADE BETTER BARGAIN THAN HE. THERE IS NO CHANCE HE WILL AGREE THEIR
                            SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ARE GREATER THAN IRAN'S. HE WILL PROBABLY CONCLUDE
                            HE HAS BEEN POORLY TREATED IN COMPARISON WITH OUR FAR EASTERN FRIENDS
                            AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RECALL TO US HIS STATEMENT DURING OIL NEGOTIATIONS
                            THAT MODERATE AND RESPONSIBLE POSITION DOESN'T PAY OFF WHILE COUNTRIES
                            WITH EXTREME AND RADICAL DEMANDS (SUCH AS LIBYA) GET THEIR WAY.</p>
                        <p> 7. THROUGHOUT THIS EXERCISE, WE HAVE PRESSED FOR EARLY DELIVERY OF
                            AIRCRAFT IRAN HAS ON ORDER. ADVANCING F-5ES TO AUGUST 1973 IS WELCOME
                            BUT HARDLY CLOSES GAP WHICH SHAH PERCEIVES. NOR DOES TRANSFER OF TITLE
                            OF LEASED F-4ES ALREADY HERE AUGMENT HIS AIR COVER. TRANSFER,
                            INCIDENTALLY, WOULD NOT BE ATTRACTIVE TO HIM (SEE PARA 2, TEHRAN 6479
                            WHICH SUPERSEDES TEHRAN 6346). DELIVERY OF MAVERICK IN SPRING 1974 WILL
                            NOT AFFECT HIS SECURITY SITUATION IN 1973. IF PRODUCTION OF NEW MODEL
                            F-4S AND F-5S CANNOT BE ACCELERATED TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE, THEN WE
                            THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING OFFERS SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH WE HAVE
                            MADE TO KOREA AND TAIWAN. SHAH WOULD NOT WISH AMERICAN PILOTS STATIONED
                            HERE TO PROVIDE DEFENSE, BUT WE THINK HE WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH OFFER
                            OF RENT-FREE LOAN OF EIGHT TO SIXTEEN F-4S UNTIL HIS F-4-F5 INVENTORIES
                            REACH ACCEPTABLE LEVEL, SA, IN ABOUT ONE YEAR HENCE.</p>
                        <p> 8. AS WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY POINTED OUT, PROBLEM HERE IS NOT RPT NOT
                            MONEY, BUT EARLY DELIVERY OF AIRCRAFT. BEFORE ADDRESSING QUESTIONS OF
                            CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, HOW WE EXPLAIN PROPOSED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
                            TO SHAH AMD POSSIBLE VISIT OF HIGH LEVEL USG OFFICIAL, WE WOULD LIKE TO
                            KNOW IF REFTEL PACKAGE CAN BE IMPROVED IN LIGHT CONSIDERATIONS IN THOF
                            MESSAGE.</p>

                            <item>Replacement Aircraft for Iran</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> has sent the
                            back-channel message at Tab B simply calling your attention to the
                            latest cable traffic on the question of how we provide Iran with
                            replacements for those 36 F-5A aircraft which the Shah agreed to have
                            sent to Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>At Tab A is a suggested brief reply. I believe the replacement package is
                            now well in hand after one bad start by State and Defense. A telegram
                            awaiting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s final
                            clearance contains a good offer for the Shah consisting of the final
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—We would advance from next November to next June the beginning of
                            delivery of 32 F-5E's earlier ordered by Iran. The delivery would be
                            completed by the end of 1973— seven months ahead of schedule. Thus, by
                            the end of 1973 the Shah will have directly replaced those aircraft
                            which he gave up with a newer model. As soon as this new model comes off
                            our production line in February or March, we would invite Iranian
                            experts to come over and participate in the initial testing here to
                            familiarize themselves as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>—To help further in bolstering his defenses during that interim period,
                            we would (a) lease eight F-4's from <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> inventory and (b) earmark two <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> squadrons (32 aircraft) for immediate delivery to Iran
                            on lease in case of need. In addition, these two squadrons could be
                            rotated through Iran on training assignments during this period to make
                            visible their availability if the Shah wished.</p>
                        <p>—We have already turned over to Iran without cost to them eight F-4's
                            which have been in Iran on lease. This would provide financial
                            compensation for the transferred aircraft.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d237-02" facs="d237-02"/>
                        <p>—We would accelerate by three months delivery of his own F-4's to begin
                            next August rather than next November.</p>
                        <p>—We have increased the number of training spots available in US schools
                            for Iranian officers and pilots as requested by the Shah.</p>
                        <p>—We would tell the Shah that his new F-4's will be equipped with the
                            Maverick missile which he has requested.</p>
                        <p>—We would accelerate by three months delivery of his own F-4's to begin
                            next August rather than next November.</p>
                        <p>—We have increased the number of training spots available in US schools
                            for Iranian officers and pilots as requested by the Shah.</p>
                        <p>—We would tell the Shah that his new F-4's will be equipped with the
                            Maverick missile which he has requested.</p>
                        <p>With the addition of the leased and earmarked aircraft, I think we can
                            feel that we have made a satisfactory offer to help the Shah cover what-
                            ever gap may have been created in his air defenses by the release of the
                            thirty-two F-5A's.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: That you approve dispatch of the brief reply to Farland
                            at Tab A. It tells him that a much better package is on the way.</p>

                        <p>1. APPRECIATE POINTS YOU MAKE IN REFTELS. WE HAVE THOROUGHLY RE-EXAMINED
                            PROBLEM AND BELIEVE WE HAVE SOLUTION THAT WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO SHAH.
                            SOLUTION CONSISTS OF MAXIMUM POSSIBLE ACCELERATED DELIVERIES OF F-5E TO
                            IRAN, COMMITMENT TO SELL MAVERICK AND, IF REQUIRED, LEASE OF 8
                            ADDITIONAL F-4 AIRCRAFT, AND CONTINGENT LEASE OF 8 F-4'S WHEN
                            CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT REQUIRE IT.</p>
                        <p>2. F-5E. THE F-5E AIRCRAFT IS IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PHASE.
                            FIRST PRODUCTION F-5E'S WILL NOT COME OFF LINE UNTIL FEBRUARY, 1973. ALL
                            AIRCRAFT TO BE PRODUCED DURING FIRST 9 MONTHS (FEB-OCT 73) WERE
                            ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED TO <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUTATION (OT&amp;E); FOR CREATION OF TRAINING
                            CAPABILITY; PLUS LIMITED NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT FOR VIETNAM. SINCE F-5E IS A
                            NEW AIRCRAFT, THOROUGH OT&amp;E IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO AVOID THE NEED
                            FOR SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION AFTER AIRCRAFT ARE DELIVERED TO
                            END-USERS.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d238-02" facs="d238-02"/>
                        <p>3. IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE SHAH'S PROBLEM, WE HAVE RESTRUCTURED
                            ALLOCATION OF INITIAL F-5E PRODUCTION WITH A VIEW TO MAINTAINING
                            THOROUGH OT&amp;E PROGRAM, LIMITING THE CREATION OF INITIAL TRAINING
                            CAPABILITY TO THAT NECESSARY TO GET IRANIAN PROGRAM LAUNCHED, AND TO
                            PROVIDE MAXIMUM NUMBER (ALL REMAINING) AIRCRAFT TO IRANIAN AIR FORCE. TO
                            SUPPLEMENT THIS, NORTHROP WOULD SEND ONE (1) INSTRUCTOR PILOT TO
                            WILLIAMS AFB (OT&amp;E AND TRAINING SITE) IN MARCH, 1973, SO THAT HE
                            COULD BE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED AND READY TO GO TO IRAN IN JUNE, 1973. WE
                            WOULD ALSO INVITE SHAH TO SEND TWO (2) HIGHLY QUALIFIED F-5A/B
                            INSTRUCTOR PILOTS TO WILLIAMS IN MID-MAY FOR SAME PURPOSE. THEIR
                            TRAINING WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 MONTHS.</p>
                        <p>4. NEW DELIVERY OF F-5E AIRCRAFT WILL BE ACCORDING TO FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:
                            FIRST TWO AIRCRAFT EARMARKED FOR IRAN WOULD BE DELIVERED TO WILLIAMS FOR
                            USE IN TRAINING ONE NORTHROP AND TWO IIAF INSTRUCTOR PILOTS MENTIONED
                            PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH. THESE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE DELIVERED TO WILLIAMS, ONE
                            EACH IN JUNE AND JULY AND THEN SHIPPED ON TO IRAN IN OCTOBER (I.E.,
                            ABOUT THE TIME THE TWO IRANIAN PILOTS COMPLETE TRAINING AND RETURN TO
                            IRAN). WE WOULD MAKE FOLLOWING AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES TO IRAN:</p>
                        <p>JUNE 1973 1 ( TO WILLIAMS AFB(#)<lb/> JULY 2 (1 TO WILLIAMS AFB)<lb/>
                            AUGUST 2<lb/> SEPTEMBER 2<lb/> OCTOBER 2 PLUS 2 FROM WILLIAMS (JUNE/JULY
                            ABOVE)<lb/> NOVEMBER 2<lb/> DECEMBER 3<lb/> JANUARY 1974 6<lb/> FEBRUARY
                            7<lb/> MARCH 5</p>
                        <p>DELIVERIES WOULD PUT 32 F-5E AIRCRAFT IN IRAN BY MARCH, 1974. UNDER THE
                            ORIGINAL PRODUCTION SCHEDULE, IRAN WOULD HAD ONLY 11 BY MARCH, 1974 AND
                            WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 32 UNTIL OCTOBER, 1974. WE HAVE THUS ACCELERATED
                            DELIVERY SCHEDULE BY 7 MONTHS. IN SO DOING, THE FIRST AIRCRAFT TO BE
                            DELIVERED WORLD-WIDE AND THE FIRST SQUADRON TO BE ACTIVATED WILL BE FOR
                            IRAN AND WE ARE GIVING SHAH PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER COUNTRY PURCHASERS/
                            RECIPIENTS, INCLUDING VIETNAM. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCELERATE
                            FURTHER PRODUCTION WITHIN TIME FRAME THAT IS OF CONCERN TO SHAH. ALL WE
                            CAN DO IS TO REALLOCATE AIRCRAFT IN PRODUCTION LINE, AND THAT IS WHAT WE
                            HAVE DONE. SHAH WILL GET ALL OF INITIAL PRODUCTION <pb n="3" xml:id="d238-03" facs="d238-03"/>FOR <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> AND VIETNAM, EXCEPT THOSE ESSENTIAL FOR OT&amp;E AND
                            TRAINING. NET EFFECT WILL BE TO POSTPONE TRAINING FOR AND DELIVERY OF
                            FIRST F-5E SQUADRON TO VIETNAM. FYI: ONLY OTHER F-5E'S TO BE PRODUCED
                            BETWEEN FEBRUARY, 1973 AND MARCH, 1974 HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY SAUDI
                            ARABIA (I.E., 15 AIRCRAFT BETWEEN NOVEMBER, 1973 AND MARCH, 1974). THESE
                            AIRCRAFT ARE CONFIGURED DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE ORDERED FOR IRAN. IN ANY
                            EVENT, SAUDI AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE REALLOCATED TO IRAN FOR BOTH
                            CONTRACTUAL AND POLITICAL REASONS. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>5. CONCERNING MAVERICK, WE ARE PREPARED TO SELL THE MISSILE,
                            MODIFICATIONS AND TRAINING REQUIRED TO EQUIP THE PLANNED 10 SQUADRONS OF
                            IRANIAN F-4D/E AIRCRAFT. AIRCRAFT MODIFICATIONS WOULD COMMENCE IN <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973 AND FIRST MISSILE DELIVERIES IN
                            SPRING OF 1974. FYI: OUR DECISION TO SELL MAVERICK TO IRAN IMPACTS ON
                            ORIGINAL PLANS FOR <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>6. WE REALIZE THAT FULL REPLACEMENT FOR 32 F-5A'S SHAH MADE AVAILABLE TO
                            USG FOR TRANSFER TO VIETNAM WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED DURING <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973 AS DESIRED. IT IS BOTH TECHNICALLY
                            AND PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE 32 F-5E'S DURING <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973. TO MEET THIS PROBLEM AND THE OTHERS
                            WHICH YOU HAVE SINGLED OUT, WE HAVE LOOKED FOR A WAY TO PROVIDE, AS
                            INDICATED IN PARA 7 OF REFTEL (A) "OFFER TO RENT-FREE LOAN OF EIGHT TO
                            SIXTEEN F-4'S UNTIL HIS F-4, F-5 INVENTORIES REACH ACCEPTABLE LEVEL,
                            SAY, IN ABOUT ONE YEAR HENCE.” TO DO THIS THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IS PREPARED, IF REQUIRED, TO LEASE NOW 8 ADDITIONAL
                            F-4D AIRCRAFT UNTIL 32 F-5E'S HAVE BEEN DELIVERED AND TO MAKE CONTINGENT
                            ARRANGEMENTS FOR LEASE OF UP TO ADDITIONAL 8 ON SHORT NOTICE IF THERE IS
                            AN ACTUAL OUTBREAK OF HOSITILITIES. FINAL DETAILS OF IMMEDIATE LEASE OF
                            8 AIRCRAFT COULD BE WORKED OUT IN MILITARY CHANNELS AFTER YOU HAVE
                            OBTAINED AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE. COSTS COULD BE WORKED OUT IN MILITARY
                            CHANNELS, WITH POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING CREDITS SIMILAR TO THAT SUGGESTED
                            FOR TURNOVER OF 8 F-4 NOW ON LEASE TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> (OFFER FOR WHICH SHOULD BE DROPPED). IN ANY EVENT WE DO
                            NOT SEE COST EXCEEDING ABOUT $4.0 MILLION FOR THE 16 MONTH PERIOD.
                            CONTINGENT LEASE ARRANGEMENT WOULD ALLOW FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> PROVISION OF UP TO 8 ADDITIONAL LEASED F-4'S UNDER
                            FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: SUBJECT TO MUTUAL CONSULTATION, AND AT A TIME
                            EXTERNAL SECURITY CONDITIONS REQUIRED, US WOULD AGREE TO LEASE 8
                            ADDITIONAL F-4'S TO <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WHICH COULD
                            ARRIVE IN IRAN WITHIN 72 HOURS OF US APPROVAL. AIRCRAFT WOULD BE DRAWN
                            FROM <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> ASSETS WHICH FROM TIME TO
                            TIME, AS WORKED OUT BY <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss>, WOULD MAKE ROTATIONAL VISITS TO

                            BE VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION OF CAPABILITY AND WOULD HELP SHAH MEET
                            PERCEIVED AIR DEFENSE GAP AND ITS EFFECT ON IRAN'S CLOSE NEIGHBORS'
                            ATTITUDES TOWARD IRAN'S AIR SUPERIORITY POSITION. FYI: BECAUSE OF F-4
                            MAINTENANCE AND PILOT SHORTAGES IN IRAN, WE UNDERSTAND THAT <gloss target="#t_IIAF1">IIAF</gloss> AT PRESENT TIME MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
                            MAINTAIN AND OPERATE ADEQUATELY ADDITIONAL F-4 AIRCRAFT. END FYI.</p>

                        <p>The claim of Sheykh Yamani, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum, that
                            the participation agreement(1) he negotiated is four times "better" than
                            the one reached by the Shah has set off a chain reaction and brought
                            forth demands from Iran that its spring 1972 agreement be revised. This
                            is an example of the leapfrogging effect which has long been of major
                            concern to the companies in their negotiations with various oil
                            producing countries. The consortium companies(2) have presented to Iran
                            calculations that compare revenues to Iran under the spring 1972
                            agreement and under the Yamani agreement were it to be applied to
                            Iranian production. These calculations appear to indicate that under the
                            Iranian Spring Agreement revenues would exceed those of the Yamani
                            formula through 1985 but would be less from 1986 through 1994. A tenuous
                            consideration in these calculations is the appropriateness of including
                            the new Kharg refinery—see below—as a revenue benefit to Iran, an
                            important</p>

                        <p>component of the Consortium's comparison presentation.(1) The benefits
                            from the new refinery include the higher cost of refinery construction
                            in Iran compared to that in large consuming markets and the higher
                            transport costs of refined product compared to crude. The Iranians
                            remain unconvinced of the validity of the assumptions upon which this
                            part of the presentation is based.</p>

                        <p>The July 1971 <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>(2) Conference in
                            Vienna renewed members' demands for host country participation in
                            existing producing operations. Following only slightly veiled threats of
                            nationalization, negotiations began in March 1972 between the companies
                            and Sheykh Zaki Yamani representing Abu Dhabi, Iraq, Qatar, and Saudi
                            Arabia. Iran, as had Algeria, Indonesia, Venezuela, et. al. in the past,
                            decided to pursue its own path toward a restructuring of basic
                            company-government relationships. In the spring of 1972, talks began at
                            the highest level — between the Shah of Iran and Exxon's chairman
                            (representing the consortium of Western oil companies operating in
                            Iran). The latter put forward the participation concept which Iran
                            flatly rejected. The negotiations proceeded in an amicable and
                            businesslike atmosphere and ended in late May with an outline of an
                            agreement which would govern the two parties' relationships for the next
                            twenty-odd years. Subsequent lower echelon meetings refined and
                            distilled the outline still further.</p>

                        <p>By October the significant provisions of the Iranian draft agreement
                            were:</p>
                        <p>1) The 460,000-B/D capacity Abadan refinery would be turned over
                            immediately to Iran (National Iranian Oil Company - NIOC), although
                            until the consortium had built a new refinery on Kharg Island, the
                            member companies would be able to have their crude processed by NIOC for
                            a fee plus 90 cents per barrel representing incremental profits Iran
                            could have made on these products were it to process and export similar
                            quantities for its own account. Initially, the refinery would serve the
                            Consortium's refined product needs and part of Iran's internal
                            requirements. The balance of the refinery's capacity would be available
                            to NIOC for sale to Consortium member companies or for direct export. As
                            the Kharg Island refinery came into operation with progressively
                            increasing output, the "balance" from the Abadan refinery would in all
                            likelihood grow significantly. Crude to the Abadan refinery would be
                            made available to NIOC at cost.</p>
                        <p>2) The companies would construct and operate for their own export
                            requirements a new refinery on Kharg Island. Initial start-up capacity
                            (1976) would be 200,000 B/D rising to 500,000 B/D by 1980.</p>
                        <p>3) NIOC would have made available to it up to 200,000 B/D of so-called
                            "premium" crude oil for export in 1973, escalating by 50,000 B/D per
                            year thereafter to a maximum of 550,000 B/D in 1980. NIOC would purchase
                            "premium" oil from the Consortium at quarter-way price.(1)</p>
                        <p>[footnote] 1. Represents the tax paid cost plus one-quarter of the
                            difference between tax-paid cost and the posted price.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d239-04" facs="d239-04"/>
                        <p>4) The companies would construct and operate for their own export
                            requirements a natural gas liquids plant.</p>
                        <p>5) Although the 1954 basic agreement expires in 1979, it grants to the
                            companies, at their sole discretion, three five-year renewal options.
                            These would be replaced by an immediate extension of the term of the
                            basic 1954 agreement to 1994.</p>
                        <p>6) The Consortium would relinquish exclusive operating rights to a
                            portion of the agreement area in the province of Luristan which would be
                            further developed by a Consortium/NIOC 50/50 joint venture. The venture
                            would be operated jointly and capital costs, operating costs, and
                            production output would be shared equally. NIOC would not make any
                            payments to Consortium members for facilities already existing at the
                            time of the joint venture's formation. The companies estimate aggregate
                            production could attain a level of 300,000 B/D.</p>
                        <p>Current Demands</p>
                        <p>Resolved to be the first among equals in the Persian Gulf and an
                            innovator in world oil affairs, and with an insatiable appetite for
                            increased revenues (Iranian statements to the contrary notwithstanding),
                            the Shah has offered the Consortium the following options:</p>
                        <p>1. make substantial changes in the structure of the Spring Agreement so
                            as to increase Iranian revenues, thereby improving revenues in the
                            latter years (after 1985); or</p>
                        <p>2. terminate the 1954 agreement in 1979 rather than in 1994; or</p>
                        <p>3. terminate it now in exchange for a long-term crude sales contract.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d239-05" facs="d239-05"/>
                        <p>An Iranian official recently called at the Department of State and at the
                            White House to make a presentation on the sales contract approach. From
                            information available, this appears to take the form of a buyer- seller
                            relationship which would amount to a complete operational takeover of
                            all facilities. Control over crude exploration, production, and refining
                            would be transferred to the Iranians. The companies would take delivery
                            of crude oil and refined products f.o.b. loading terminals.(1) The
                            contract would provide for delivery of specified amounts of crude to the
                            companies at specified base prices over a period of time.</p>
                        <p>The companies would be indirectly reimbursed for any future capital
                            inputs into exploration and production by discounts from the base price.
                            Presumably, appropriate consideration would also be given to the
                            companies' loss of operating rights under the 1954 agreement,as the
                            Iranians have made it clear that the discounts to the base price would
                            be so fixed as to provide fully for depreciation(2) and profits the
                            companies would have made had the Yamani participation formula been
                            applied to Iranian production. By implication the quantities of oil sold
                            to the companies would be similar to those that would have obtained
                            under the Yamani formula.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] 1. At present, title to crude passes at the well-head whence
                            oil is transferred either to the loading terminal for export as crude or
                            to the refinery. In the latter case, refined products are subsequently
                            transferred to a loading terminal.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] 2. Under the 1954 Consortium Agreement, title to all fixed
                            assets passes to NIOC from the moment of their installation. The
                            companies' rights to these assets are limited to their depreciation and
                            use during the term of the Agreement.</p>

                        <p>The Iranian emissary argued that this conceptual approach is the one most
                            likely to achieve stability and security of supply at reasonable prices
                            for the international oil market. He said that Iran would seek no new
                            monetary benefits in negotiating such a contract. He asked for U.S.
                            understanding and, by inference, support. New meetings at the highest
                            level between the Consortium and Iran are scheduled for December 10 to
                            14.</p>
                        <p>For the Consortium members, the proposal raises the following concerns:
                            a) it may stimulate rather than discourage leapfrogging; b) it may
                            deprive them of tax advantages they now enjoy under American law; and c)
                            it may deprive them of day-to-day control over production and thus give
                            the Iranian Government control over all operations in Iran.</p>
                        <p>Under the 1954 agreement Iran owns all exploration, producing, and
                            refining facilities, although the Consortium has exclusive use of them.
                            The buyer-seller relationship would place the operation of these facil-
                            ities exclusively in Iranian hands. Moreover, it would dramatically
                            change the fundamental company-government relationship which has
                            prevailed in essence from time immemorial to the present: day-to-day
                            control by the major international oil companies of the sources of
                            supply of most or all of the oil they require for their downstream
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>Most major producer nations of the free world would find it politically
                            virtually impossible to resist making similar demands on the companies
                            operating on their territories in order to respond to nationalistic
                            pressures for indigenous control of their natural resources. Economic
                            arguments against such moves based on cash flows, social return on
                            development capital, and increased possibility of price competition</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d239-07" facs="d239-07"/>
                        <p>between the new national producers would very likely be brushed aside. In
                            fact, were OPEC's present cohesiveness able to withstand the strain of
                            such a major restructuring of relationships, producing nations could
                            well compete with one another in extracting the highest possible sales
                            price from buyers.</p>
                        <p>The shock waves would very likely be felt in the major consuming
                            countries. Those in favor of direct consumer-producer nation agreements
                            would find their arguments reinforced by the breakdown of the
                            traditional supply system. Competition for available supplies would in
                            all likelihood increase and be reflected in higher prices for
                            petroleum.</p>
                        <p>Sales contracts usually provide for a sales price inclusive of all taxes,
                            if any, up to the point of delivery, which in this case would be f.o.b.
                            loading terminal. This could mean a loss of U.S. tax credits which the
                            American Consortium members(1) are now allowed by the Internal Revenue
                            Service to apply against U.S. taxes due on all foreign operations. The
                            actual loss to the U.S. companies would be approximately 52 percent of
                            the tax credit, as the higher crude or product cost would reduce taxable
                            income by the amount of the tax credit under the present agreement. To
                            avoid this problem, sale might take place in Iran to an Iranian subsid-
                            iary of the American member company. This subsidiary would then be taxed
                            by the Iranian Government at a level equivalent to present Iranian tax
                            levels, and transaction prices would be adjusted downward
                            accordingly.</p>

                        <p>In the past the companies' most effective bargaining counter has been
                            their operational control of the sources of supply, as well as their
                            technological know-how, their downstream marketing and distribution
                            networks, and their capital resources. Loss of operational control would
                            deprive them of the power to reduce output levels in a country, a point
                            which has been a major element in their past bargaining strength in
                            sales price negotiations. The threat of seeking other sources of supply
                            may be no longer credible and could be disadvantageous to the
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian presentations in Washington addressed solely the sales
                            contract option and did not mention the other two. The Shah's determina-
                            tion to see Iran develop economically and militarily at the fastest pace
                            possible has stretched available funds to the limit. The Iranians are
                            acutely aware of the replacement costs of the capital that might be re-
                            quired were Iran to finance all investment in oil within the country.
                            These considerations suggest that the sales contract option may well
                            only be a ploy to obtain satisfaction through higher revenues as
                            proposed in option 1.</p>
                        <p>Option 2 seems to be the least likely of the three demands to be
                            responsive both to the companies' needs and to Iran's desires. It would
                            dispense legally with the three five-year renewal options. However, it
                            would remove an important incentive for the companies to raise current
                            production to a level of 8 million B/D as presently planned, since the
                            companies would be unable to depreciate fully any new investment. Thus,
                            while retaining control, they would not in all likelihood expand
                            production,</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d239-09" facs="d239-09"/>
                        <p>and revenue to Iran would be significantly less than is now projected.
                            Variations to the basic concept of this option could include a sales
                            contract which would be effective at the end of the 1954 agreement
                            period and would provide for a discount to a base price which would
                            permit the companies to depreciate fully all new investment not so
                            depreciated by October 1979.</p>
                        <p>Option 1, however, would seem to hold the most promise in meeting Iranian
                            objectives. If the terms of the Spring Agreement are revised upward so
                            as to provide net revenues, excluding the benefits of the Kharg
                            refinery, to Iran over the entire period 1973-1994 equal to that which
                            Iran would have obtained under the Yamani participation formula, both
                            Iranian objectives of maximizing revenues and minimizing capital
                            expenditures in oil could be met. The companies, on the other hand,
                            would retain control of the sources of supply which may be worth the
                            higher cost over that of the present Spring Agreement. Additional costs
                            to the companies over the 21-year period could exceed $900 million.</p>

                        <p>1. DURING AUDIENCE WITH SHAH DECEMBER 8, I HANDED HIM PAPER SUMMARIZING
                            POSITION CONTAINED STATE REFTELS. TEXT BY SEPTEL.</p>
                        <p>2. AFTER READING PAPER, SHAH WAS AFFIRMATIVE IN HIS INITIAL RESPONSE, BUT
                            NATURALLY SAID HE WISHED TAKE OUT PROPOSALS UNDER ADVISEMENT. HE WAS
                            ESPECIALLY APPRECIATIVE OUR EFFORTS TO GIVE IRAN ACCELERATED DELIVERY OF
                            F-5ES.</p>
                        <p>3. HE OFFERED ONE SUBSTANTIVE COMMENT. ON PROPOSAL TO LEASE EIGHT F-4DS,
                            SHAH MADE QUITE CLEAR HE DID NOT WANT D MODELS. I EXPLAINED THAT WE FELT
                            D MODEL WAS BETTER SUITED FOR IRAN'S CAPABILITY TO UTILIZE NEW AIRCRAFT
                            AT THIS TIME AND THAT EARLY INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL E MODELS MIGHT
                            DISTURB CAREFUL PLANNING AND TRAINING FOR F-4E PROGRAM BEGINNING IN MAY
                            1973. REFERRING TO PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS OF EARLIER LEASE OF F-4ES, I
                            RECALLED HOW TRANSFER OF THOSE AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN DIFFICULT DECISION FOR
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, REDUCING NUMBER OF E MODELS
                            AVAILABLE FOR ITS ACTIVE INVENTORY.</p>
                        <p>4. HOWEVER, SHAH WAS PERSISTENT AND FIRM IN NOT PREFERRRING D MODELS,
                            AND, AS AUTHORIZED, I SAID E MODELS COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IF HE
                            DESIRED. SHAH COMMENTED ADDITION OF EIGHT E MODELS TO THOSE NOW ON LEASE
                            AT MEHRABAD WOULD GIVE IRAN ANOTHER FULL SQUADRON OF F-4ES. IF THIS IS
                            SHAH'S THINKING, IT MAY BE THAT HE WILL LATER ASK US TO EXTEND LEASE ON
                            F-4ES PRESENTLY IN COUNTRY IN ORDER MAINTAIN COMPLETE SQUADRON UNTIL 32
                            F-5ES ARRIVE.</p>
                        <p>5. AS TO CONTINGENT LEASE OF F-AS, I TOLD HIM AIRCRAFT COULD BE EITHER D
                            OR E MODELS, DEPENDING CONSULTATIONS AT TIME IRAN MADE REQUEST.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d240-02" facs="d240-02"/>
                        <p>6. IN CONCLUDING DISCUSSION SHAH EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR ESPECIALLY
                            FORTHCOMING MEASURES WE HAD TAKEN IN THIS EXERCISE TO MEET IRAN'S NEEDS.
                            HE IS AWARE OF WHAT ACCELERATION OF F-5S AND TRANSFER OF F-4S MEAN TO
                            USAF. I WISH TO COMMEND THOSE WHO HAVE HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH DIFFICULT
                            IMPLICATIONS THIS EXERCISE AND TAKE HARD DECISIONS WHICH FORMED OUR
                            POSITION. AT THIS STAGE, I BELIEVE, YOU HAVE MADE VERY POSITIVE
                            CONTRIBUTION TO OUR RELATIONS WITH IMPORTANT ALLY AND FRIEND.</p>

                            TECHNICIANS AND MASSIVE INJECTION OF US EQUIPMENT, IS MATTER OF HIGHEST
                            POLITICAL IMPORTANCE TO SHAH. AS WE ARE REGULARLY REMINDED, HE IS
                            ANXIOUS TO RECEIVE SOME SIGNAL THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            AGENCIES ARE TAKING ACTION ON PRESIDENTIAL ASSURANCES CONCERNING
                            REQUESTED US TECHNICIANS. WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY RESPONDING TO GOI

                        <p>ACTION REQUESTED: TWO THINGS: FIRST, WHAT MAY WE TELL SHAH IN RESPONSE

                            FIRST ARRIVALS? SECOND, WE REQUEST PRICE PER MAN FIGURE FOR FINANCING OF
                            ANY TAFT TYPE TEAMS THAT MAY ARRIVE IN JANUARY-MARCH PERIOD SO THAT GOI
                            CAN PREPARE REQUISITE LEGISLATION FOR MAJLIS. THESE FIGURES REQUIRED BY

                            REQUESTED.</p>
                        <p>1. ON THREE OCCASIONS DURING PAST WEEK SHAH HAS RELAYED THROUGH HIGHEST
                            MILITARY CHANNELS TO CHIEF, ARMISH/MAAG, HIS CONCERN FOR STATUS OF
                            IRAN'S REQUEST FOR MILITARY TECHNICIANS TO ASSIST IN BUILDUP OF ARMED
                            FORCES. WE FEEL CERTAIN THAT AT THIS TIME NO OTHER US-IRANIAN PROGRAM
                            HAS HIGHER PRIORITY IN A SHAH'S THINKING THAN OUR AGREEMENT TO SELL IRAN
                            SERVICES OF MILITARY TECHNICIANS IN SUPPORT OF <pb n="2" xml:id="d242-02" facs="d242-02"/>VAST AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT
                            IRAN IS BUYING FROM US.</p>
                        <p>2. SHAH'S ORIGINAL REQUEST WAS APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE BY PRESIDENT IN
                            THEIR MEETING LAST MAY AND SPECIFICALLY AFFIRMED IN KISSINGER MEMORANDUM
                            OF JUNE I5. DURING SUMMER MONTHS, IRANIAN MILITARY AND <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> SERVICE SECTIONS CAREFULLY REVIEWED
                            GOI REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE AND WERE ABLE TO REDUCE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL
                            REQUESTED BY TWO-THIRDS, SHAH WAS UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PROCESS AND
                            SEVERAL MONTHS LATER ALSO ACCEPTED, ALBEIT WITH SOME DOUBT, NEED FOR
                            VISIT OF MG MOENCH TEAM FOR STUDY OF HOUSEKEEPING PROBLEMS, HIS DOUBTS
                            CENTERED ON NECESSITY FOR TEAM'S VISIT. ACCORDING TO HIS LINE OF
                            THOUGHT, WHY NOT COMPUTE COSTS, BILL <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            AND SIMPLY BRING IN NEW PERSONNEL ON TERMS SIMILAR TO THOSE AFFORDED
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> STAFF? THROUGH EFFORTS OF
                            AMBASSADOR AND <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> CHIEFS WE THOUGHT
                            WE MADE PERSUASIVE CASE FOR REQUIREMENT FOR MOENCH TEAM ANALYSIS OF
                            LARGE-SCALE AND COMPLEX PROGRAM. IT WAS HELPFUL IN THAT PERIOD TO HAVE
                            FRESH RESTATEMENT OF PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT WHICH WE PRESENTED IN
                            WRITING TO SHAH IN CONTEXT OF OPERATION ENHANCE PLUS.</p>
                        <p>3. NOW, SIX MONTHS AFTER PRESIDENT'S DECISION AND THREE WEEKS SINCE
                            MOENCH TEAM'S DEPARTURE, SHAH AND STAFF, WITHOUT FURTHER INFORMATION,
                            ARE SHOWING SERIOUS CONCERN. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY ATTEMPTED EXPLAIN THESE
                            DELAYS AS ESSENTIAL PROCESSING FOR LARGE OPERATION, BUT WE ARE RUNNING
                            OUT OF PERSUASIVE REASONS.</p>
                        <p>4. THERE ARE PRACTICAL ASPECTS TO IRANIAN CONCERN. FIRST, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WILL PAY ALL COSTS OF PROGRAM WHICH
                            WILL BE NO SMALL UNDERTAKING. TOTAL SUM WILL HAVE TO BE FINANCED WITH
                            AUTHORITY OF MAJLIS. SPECIAL LEGISLATION COVERING PROGRAM EXPENDITURES
                            IN JANUARY-MARCH PERIOD MUST BE PREPARED WITHIN TEN DAYS FOR
                            PRESENTATION TO CURRENT SESSION. THUS, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> SHOULD HAVE ASAP REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF COSTS OF
                            BLOQ#TECHNICIANS WHO, ACCORDING OUR PREDICTIONS, ARE EXPECTED ARRIVE IN
                            FIRST QUARTER 1973. SECOND, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MOVING
                            AHEAD ON ITS BUILDUP IN SUCH AREAS AS INCREASED TRAINING SCHOOL
                            CAPACITIES, TRAINING SCHEDULES, ETC., WHICH MUST PARALLEL OUR BUILDUP.
                            PROGRAMS TO THIS END ARE UNDERWAY ON ASSUMPTION TECHNICIANS WILL START
                            ARRIVING SOON. THESE ARE HIGHLY WELCOME STEPS BY IRAN <pb n="3" xml:id="d242-03" facs="d242-03"/>AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED, BUT WE
                            RISK UPSETTING IRANIAN TIMETABLE WHICH IT IN OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS TO
                            PROMOTE. NEED FOR PROMPT US INPUT INTO THEIR TIMETABLE IS EVIDENT.</p>
                        <p>5. ACTION REQUESTED. (A) IN ORDER COPE WITH INCREASING RESTLESSNESS OF
                            SHAH AND HIS PLANNERS REGARDING STATUS OF BUILDUP AND TARGET DATES WHEN

                            TELL SHAH. WE HAVE RUN OUT OF ANSWERS AND ARE BEGINNING LOSE
                            CREDIBILITY. (B) WE REQUEST DOLLAR FIGURE PER TECHNICIAN COVERING
                            JANUARY-MARCH PERIOD WHICH WE MAY PASS TO GOI. IF THIS NOT AVAILABLE IN

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to inform you of the status of initial
                            planning to provide increased technical assistance support to Iran and
                            to seek approval for continued planning actions.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that this assistance requirement dates from the visit by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to Iran in May of
                            1972. In talks with the Shah on 30-31 May, the President made
                            commitments (Tab A) for U.S. support of Iran, including the assigning of
                            an increased number of U.S. military technicians to work with the
                            Iranian Services. In response to a White House request in this regard,
                            we advised on 5 July 1972 that requirements would be obtained from the
                            Embassy and MAAG in Iran preliminary to country-to-country negotiations
                            on uniformed teams (Tab B). This proposed action was approved by White
                            House Memorandum of 25 July 1972 (Tab C). Subsequently, coordinated
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/State guidance was furnished
                            (Tab D) for in-country collaboration with the Iranians.</p>
                        <p>As a result of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>/Iranian discussions,
                            the skills and numbers of personnel were initially defined. In these
                            discussions, the initial Iranian request was reduced from approximately
                            2,000 to 1,000, within which spaces were identified that were
                            appropriate for filling with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            civilians. Following Washington review of the initial <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> proposed list of requirements by
                                <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and the services, a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/State team visited Tehran 27 November-3
                            December 1972, to validate projected requirements. Particular attention
                            was given to the development of logistic support needs and costs, full
                            pricing data, and policy guidelines for deployment of technical
                            personnel as Technical Assistance Field Teams (TAFTs). Memorandum of
                            team visit is at Tab E. Based on discussions between <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/State Team, the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the Ambassador, the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> again refined the lists of personnel
                            requirements. These lists were received 15 December by <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and service staffs and are undergoing
                            further review at this time.</p>

                        <p>Of the strengths shown above, the U.S. Army total at (a) includes 155
                            positions which are validated for either military or <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> civilian fill, depending on
                            availability of skills; 88 additional positions are planned for fill by
                            DA civilians vice military. Further, the strengths at (b) are subject to
                            reduction by approximately 230, if a satisfactory civilian contract can
                            be negotiated for an Iranian Army aviation support activity at Esfahan.
                            While virtually any of the <gloss target="#t_TAFT1">TAFT</gloss>
                            positions could be filled by a civilian possessing the necessary skill
                            and experience, in-country and Washington planning to date has followed
                            the Shah's stated preference for "bluesuiters,” particularly in control
                            and supervisory positions. Under any civilian/military mix, pricing
                            would be carefully derived to insure full U.S. compensation for direct
                            and indirect costs of the technicians deployment and activities in Iran.
                            We are working closely with <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and DSAA
                            Comptrollers in this regard.</p>
                        <p>We do not know what number of uniformed military technicians the
                            President has in mind in the "blue suiter" approach. The Shah has,
                            however, established his negotiating position that the President's
                            agreement permits "any number that is needed in Iran”; a statement which
                            has not been contradicted by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. It
                            is useful to note that prior to the President's visit the Shah indicated
                            a desire for "a few hundred" U.S. military technicians (Tab F). While we
                            will obviously respond to the President's desires, we have serious
                            reservations about the very large number of uniformed personnel
                            currently proposed, which would be additive to the 605 U.S. military
                            personnel now in- country in 18 separate organizations (Tab G). We also
                            are concerned about the morale and retention problems related to the
                            unaccompanied and/or isolated tours proposed for more than half the
                            personnel. An early definition of this commitment is required in order
                            that we may continue our planning and take the long lead-time steps
                            necessary to insure an orderly deployment of both the support and
                            technical personnel. Relative to the magnitude of the President's
                            commitment, your guidance is requested on the alternatives outlined
                            below.</p>

                        <p>1. SECRETARY'S STATEMENT MADE MOST TEL AVIV MORNING PAPERS DESPITE LATE
                            HOUR OF RELEASE ISRAELI TIME AND WAS LEAD ITEM ON KOL ISRAEL NEWSCASTS
                            MORNING JANUARY WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS EXPRESSION OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CONCERN FOR PLIGHT OF IRAQI JEWRY WILL
                            HAVE EFFECT OF DAMPENING AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION
                            VOICED HERE OVER ALLEGED WORLD INDIFFERENCE TO HANGINGS. CHARGE OF WORLD
                            QUOTE HYPOCRISY UNQUOTE IN TURNING DEAF EAR TO PERSECUTIONS OF JEWS IN
                            ARAB COUNTRIES IS ONE OF MAIN THEMES IN STATEMENTS BY PM ESHKOL AND
                            OTHER SPEAKERS IN KNESSET JANUARY 27 (TEL AVIV 322) AND IS HEAVILY
                            STRESSED IN TODAY'S EDITORIALS. POSITION TAKEN PUBLICLY BY FRENCH (AND
                            WHICH ACCORDING LONDON 678 BRITISH ALSO PLAN TAKE) THAT MATTER IS
                            INTERNAL IRAQI AFFAIR NATURALLY RECALLS TO ISRAELI MIND HESITATION OF
                            POWERS TO TAKE OPEN STAND AGAINST PERSECUTIONS OF JEWRY IN ARAB LANDS
                            HERETOFORE.</p>
                        <p>2. OUR HOPE IS THAT GOI WILL CONCENTRATE AT THIS STAGE ON MOBILIZING
                            WORLD OPINION AND GOOD OFFICES OF FOREIGN <pb n="2" xml:id="d245-02" facs="d245-02"/>GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT FURTHER EXECUTIONS. THIS
                            MAKES DIRECT MILITARY ACTION SEEM FAIRLY UNLIKELY AT THE MOMENT. WE OF
                            COURSE CANNOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY ENTIRELY, HOWEVER, AS PAST EXPERIENCE
                            UNDERSCORES UNPREDICTABILITY OF ISRAELI MILITARY STRIKES. IN PRESENT
                            INSTANCE IDF WOULD NOT HAVE TO LOOK FAR AFIELD TO FIND AN IRAQI TARGET.
                            ISRAEL AUTHORITIES MUST REALIZE HOWEVER THAT IN VIEW OF MASS HYSTERIA
                            WHICH APPARENTLY PREVAILS AT THIS MOMENT IN BAGHDAD ANY IDF ACTION
                            AGAINST IRAQ COULD PROVOKE NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL EXECUTIONS BUT ALSO
                            POSSIBLY MASS POGROM OF THOSE JEWS LEFT IN IRAQ.</p>
                        <p>3. WHATEVER OTHER CONSIDERATIONS <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MAY
                            BRING INTO LINE ISRAELI ACTIONS WILL WITHOUT ANY DOUBT BE INFLUENCED BY
                            EXTENT WORLD SUPPORT FOR (OR INDIFFERENCE TO) EFFORTS TO PREVENT FURTHER
                            EXECUTIONS. BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT BOTH ON POLITICAL AND HUMANITARIAN
                            GROUNDS FOR US TO FOLLOW UP SECRETARY'S STATEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL STEPS
                            TO HEAD OFF MORE BLOODSHED. WE RECOGNIZE DANGER THAT PUBLIC DECLARATIONS
                            MAY MERELY DRAW STIFF IRAQI RESPONSE (AS IN CASE OF UNSYG'S STATEMENT)
                            AND POSSIBLY FURTHER HARDEN IRAQI POSITION. PERHAPS DEPARTMENT COULD
                            EXPLORE POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING BEHIND SCENES INDIAN AND OTHER NEUTRAL
                            POWER INTERVENTION WITH IRAQI AND OTHER ARAB GOVTS, STRESSING DEPLORABLE
                            EFFECT OF EXECUTIONS ON WORLD OPINION AND SERIOUS DAMAGE THEY DO TO ARAB
                            IMAGE.</p>
                        <p>4. ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH WHICH OCCURS TO US IS PROPOSAL FOR EXCHANGE OF
                            FEDAYEEN PRISONERS HELD BY ISRAELIS AGAINST DDZIS EDHNCUI JEWISH SPIES.
                            A SIMILAR PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY ITALIANS PROVED TO BE KEY TO SOLUTION
                            OF LAST SUMMER'S CRISIS OVER HIJACKING OF EL AL PLANE. WE REALIZE
                            CURRENT SITUATION IS DIFFERENT IN MANY RESPECTS AND SUCH AN EXCHANGE
                            WOULD POSE MANY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS FOR BOTH ISRAELIS AND IRAQIS. HOWEVER
                            IF PUT FORWARD WITH SKILL AND DETERMINATION BY A PARTY RECOGNIZED AS
                            FRIENDLY BY IRAQIS AND AT LEAST RELATIVELY NEUTRAL BY ISRAELIS IT MIGHT
                            HAVE CHANCE OF SUCCESS.</p>

                        <p> QTE I have been instructed by my Government to draw to your attention
                            the following statement issued by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName> on January 27, 1969,
                            when he learned of the public execution of 14 persons convicted for
                            espionage in Iraq:</p>
                        <p> INNER QTE (Text as in Para 3 of State 13133) END INNER QTE.</p>
                        <p> QTE The Government of the United States recognizes the legal right of
                            any government to bring to trial and administer justice to any of its
                            citizens. However, <pb n="2" xml:id="d246-02" facs="d246-02"/>the manner
                            in which these executions and the trials that preceded them were
                            conducted scarcely conforms to normally accepted standards of respect
                            for human rights and human dignity or to the obligations in this regard
                            that the United Nations Charter imposes upon all members. Moreover, the
                            spectacular way in which they were carried out seems to have been
                            designed to arouse emotions and to intensify the very explosive
                            atmosphere of suspicion and hostility in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p> QTE The United States hopes that the world-wide revulsion aroused by the
                            reports of these trials and executions will induce those responsible to
                            carry out their solemn Charter obligations to promote INNER QTE
                            universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental
                            freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or
                            religion END INNER QTE. Repetition of the recent tragic events would be
                            bound to make more difficult efforts within and outside the United
                            Nations toward the goals <pb n="3" xml:id="d246-03" facs="d246-03"/>of

                        <p> QTE I respectfully request that this letter be circulated as a Security
                            Council document. END QTE </p>

                            the Indians have over the past several weeks made diplomatic

                            <item>Arthur Goldberg's Suggestion for U.S. Initiatives to Seek
                                Immigration of Iraq's Jews - ACTION MEMORANDUM</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Arthur Goldberg has written you suggesting that we attempt to influence
                            the Government of Iraq to permit its Jews to emigrate (TAB A). He
                            suggests that the United States signify its readiness, either privately
                            or publicly, to admit these Jews into this Country.</p>
                        <p>We believe this idea should be pursued. It reflects the highest American
                            humanitarian tradition, and if successful it would remove a serious
                            irritant from the Middle Eastern scene. Even if it failed, the impact on
                            world opinion would be very favorable and the President's action when it
                            became known, would be widely acclaimed at home.</p>
                        <p>The Jewish community in Iraq, which was once large and prosperous, has
                            now dwindled to some 2,500 harassed individuals. There is some slight
                            possibility that Iraq would agree to divest itself of these people, if
                            suitable inducements in cash or kind were offered, and if negotiations
                            were carried on through a proper intermediary and in secret. Israel
                            would probably be prepared to consider some form of compensation for
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Iran would appear to be the most appropriate intermediary. Iraq is
                            anxious to maintain correct relations with Iran because the latter has
                            the capability of assisting the Iraqi Kurds in their continuing
                            insurrection.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d248-02" facs="d248-02"/>
                        <p>The Iraqis would no doubt demand as one condition of any arrangement that
                            none of the refugees be permitted to go to Israel. As the attached
                            memorandum (TAB B) from the Legal Adviser indicates, the United States
                            would be able to admit them here. Certain other countries would no doubt
                            be willing to receive some of them, if we decided that the group should
                            be dispersed.</p>
                        <p>Iranian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> is
                            leaving Washington February 3 for Switzerland, where he will consult
                            with the Shah, the only Iranian who can make a decision in a matter of
                            this importance. If the President should decide that we should take
                            action along the lines suggested by Justice Goldberg, <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> could raise this sensitive
                            question in a direct and discreet manner.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that this operation would adversely affect our efforts
                            to free the two Americans now held in Iraq.</p>
                        <p>At the appropriate time, we would wish to do some selective consultations
                            with Congress.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you seek Presidential authorization to permit us to pursue this
                            proposal with representatives of Iran and Israel. A draft memorandum is
                            attached (TAB C).</p>
                        <p>I have also prepared a brief interim reply from you to Arthur Goldberg

                        <p>Arthur Goldberg has written to me suggesting that we attempt to influence
                            the Government of Iraq to permit its Jews to emigrate, and that we
                            signify our readiness either privately or publicly to permit them to
                            enter this country. The number of individuals involved approximates
                            2,500.</p>
                        <p>I believe such a step would be in the humanitarian tradition of the
                            United States, and that when it became known it would have a highly
                            favorable impact both here and abroad regardless of the outcome. Secret
                            approaches could be made through the Government of Iran, since we have
                            no relations with Iraq. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, Iraqi
                            Jews could be admitted to the United States as refugees, or in the
                            parole of the Attorney General.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you authorize me to pursue this matter promptly, working
                            discreetly through the Government of Iran.</p>

                        <p>Belgium has represented our interests in Iraq since 1967. Because of
                            limitations imposed by the Iraqi government, there are no American
                            personnel in Baghdad to assist the Belgian staff. Iraq's chaotic
                            domestic political situation and the Iraqi tendency to equate the United
                            States and Israel render Belgian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName>'s task extremely delicate and demanding. For
                            example, for some time Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> has been attempting to forestall the Government
                            of Iraq's desire to purchase, or perhaps even expropriate, our property
                            in Baghdad by simply maintaining that he still has no instructions. In
                            December several American citizens were arrested, including Paul Bail
                            and his wife and son, apparently because the family possessed a short
                            wave radio. After a series of demarches, Mr. Bail was finally freed on
                            Wednesday, February 5 and rejoined his wife who had previously been
                            released in the custody of the Belgian Embassy.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Iraqi government has recently launched an intensive campaign to rally
                            public support behind it by playing up the subversive and military
                            threat from Israel. Integral parts of this effort are the spy trials and
                            executions in Baghdad and Iraqi emphasis on the danger of a major
                            Israeli attack. This paper examines briefly the charges that have been
                            raised and the situation of the Iraqi Jewish community. The paper also
                            reviews the deterioration of the Ba'thi regime since its return to power
                            last summer and analyzes the internal political crisis which has led the
                            regime to engage in the current spy hunt and to adopt an increasingly
                            provocative stance toward Israel.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>The current spy hunt in Baghdad and Iraqi predictions of an Israeli
                            attack on Iraq's forces in Jordan are largely motivated by the Ba'thi
                            regime's extreme insecurity and its fear of imminent overthrow. The
                            Ba'this are seeking to exploit genuine Iraqi apprehension of Israel's
                            subversive activities within the country for the purpose of mobilizing
                            popular support for the regime and discrediting all opposition elements
                            as agents of Israel. More important, the Ba'this hope to dramatize an
                            Israeli threat sufficiently to unify the Iraqi army behind the regime,
                            whose vulnerability to a coup is increased by internal factional
                            disputes.</p>
                        <p>Of the fourteen persons hanged as spies in Baghdad on 27 January, nine
                            were Iraqi Jews, and fears have been expressed for the safety of the
                            remaining Jewish community in Iraq. Israel has hinted that it may take
                            drastic action,</p>

                            February 11, 1969. <pb n="2" xml:id="d251-02" facs="d251-02"/>should
                            further harm befall the Iraqi Jews. The Iraqi regime, for its part,
                            seems almost to be wishing for Israeli action, either against Iraq's
                            troops in Jordan or against Iraq itself, to demonstrate that the alleged
                            threat from Israel is real.</p>
                        <p>The Ba'th party in Iraq has disappointed early hopes that its rule would
                            be an improvement over the Arif government which it ousted in July 1968.
                            During their seven months in power, the Ba'this have discredited
                            themselves by inept leadership, factionalism, duplicity, and
                            repression—and in the process have alienated virtually every significant
                            political and ethnic grouping in Iraq. In their effort to extend their
                            control over the Iraqi army, the Ba'this have replaced many senior
                            officers, thereby antagonizing others, and the threat exists of a
                            military reaction such as put an end to the 1963 Ba'thi regime. The
                            deteriorating internal security situation has been marked by reports of
                            attempted coups and by arbitrary arrests and random acts of terror by
                            Ba'thi security gangs, which often seem to act on their own authority.
                            There has also been a rising current of anti-Americanism and a frantic
                            search for scapegoats. In December 1968, soon after an Israeli reprisal
                            against Iraqi positions in Jordan, the drumbeating and spy hunting began
                            in earnest. While the Iraqis may have been momentarily checked by
                            unfavorable international, and Arab, reaction to the recent hangings,
                            the survival of the regime is at stake, and the campaign can be expected
                            to continue. Given its narrow political base, dissatisfaction in the
                            army, and the general instability of the situation in Iraq, the present
                            tactics are unlikely to save the Ba'th government for long— unless there
                            is indeed a major Israeli attack.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Shaky Ba'this Attempting to Mobilize Support</p>
                        <p>The Iraqi government is engaged in a faltering regime's classic ploy of
                            psychological mobilization against an external threat. It asserts that
                            Israel, abetted by its mainstay, the US, is the source of Iraq's current
                            difficulties and that Israel and the US are conspiring to bring about
                            the downfall of the revolutionary regime. To be effective, such a
                            conspiratorial thesis must be supported by at least some evidence, which
                            the Iraqis have attempted to produce and publicize through the spy
                            trials. Though Israel may well have covert assets in Iraq, the Iraqi
                            Jews, with their movements restricted and under constant surveillance,
                            would make poor recruits for any Israeli espionage or sabotage net.
                            Nonetheless, in the recent trials they and others have served as
                            credible scapegoats to dramatize Iraq's struggle against sinister
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Underlying the trials is the insecurity of the regime and its frustration
                            at being unable to develop widespread backing or to achieve decisive
                            control. Nothing has worked for the Ba'this—conciliation, terror, or
                            packing the civil administration, army, and security forces with Ba'th
                            party members, all have been unsuccessful. The regime is still
                            unpopular, weak, and internally divided. Even more unsettling to the
                            Ba'this, who were thrown out by the military in 1963, is uncertainty
                            about the attitude of the army, raising the specter of another military
                            coup, perhaps, as in 1963, with the connivance of disgruntled members of
                            their own regime.</p>
                        <p>By extending the alleged Israeli conspiracy to take in various dissident
                            elements in the country, the regime seeks to portray domestic opposition
                            as treason to the Arab cause and to justify its own repressive measures
                            as needed protection for the country. The Ba'this have evidently also
                            concluded that their own internal factionalism and the potential
                            dissaffection of the army can only be overcome within the framework of a
                            confrontation with Israel—with Iraq in the vanguard. Iraqi drumbeating
                            in Jordan and show trials in Baghdad both highlight Iraq's "exposed
                            position" and the necessity of all Iraqis to rally behind the
                            government. To prove their point, the Ba'this seem to be almost
                            deliberately inviting a major Israeli response.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Show Trials in Baghdad</p>
                        <p>On January 27, 1969, fourteen Iraqi citizens, including nine Jews, two
                            Christians, and three Moslems, were hanged in Baghdad as Israeli spies.
                            They had been convicted by a three-man revolutionary tribunal whose
                            president announced on January 28 that another espionage trial would
                            follow, in which the defendants would be charged with spying for the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The new trial may have been
                            delayed by the international outcry which greeted the results of the
                            first trial. Not only were the hangings deplored throughout the West,
                            they were received with pained silence and even some criticism in the
                            Arab countries. Cairo's semi-official newspaper al-Ahram chided the
                            Iraqis for the untimeliness of the executions and for the carnival
                            atmosphere surrounding them. The best that most Arab comnentators could
                            find to say was that the Iraqis were entitled to deal with their own
                            citizens and internal affairs as they saw fit. Israeli sources assert
                            that in the next trial there will be 35 defendants, of which 13 are
                            Jews, and that this group will be charged with spying for Israel, as
                            well as with sabotage and with organizing the defection of the Iraqi
                            pilot who flew <pb n="4" xml:id="d251-04" facs="d251-04"/>his MIG-21 to
                            Israel in 1966. Probably in response to the unfavorable world reaction,
                            Iraqi President al-<persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> has told
                            an interviewer that all those in the next group to be tried are Iraqi
                            Moslems. Moreover, about two dozen Iraqi Jews arrested prior to the
                            Ba'thi regime's takeover in July 1968 reportedly have just been released
                            from prison. This apparent amnesty, however, is not known to have been
                            extended to those arrested in Ba'thi security roundups since July 1968
                            or during the current spy scare.</p>
                        <p>Over 60 Iraqis are believed to be awaiting trial on various charges. The
                            two most prominent individuals among them are Dr. Abd al-Rahman
                            al-Bazzaz, a highly respected former diplomat who served as Premier in
                            1966-67, who has been a rallying point for Iraqi moderates, and Major
                            General Abd al-Aziz al-Ugaily, a somewhat apolitical retired officer of
                            strong personality and great prestige among the Iraqi military, who has
                            been repeatedly mentioned as a potential President or Premier and who
                            served as Defense Minister in the 1966 al-Bazzaz Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>The essence of the government's case can be gathered from confessions
                            made by two of the defendants in the recent spy trial and broadcast over
                            Baghdad radio and television on December 14. The first of these
                            statements described an alleged Israeli espionage network that gathered
                            information on the Iraqi military and conducted sabotage training for
                            Jewish youths. The persons named in this confession were among those
                            executed on January 27. The second confession vaguely linked the Israeli
                            spy ring to an elaborate clandestine plotting group which included
                            members of the pre-1958 regime, members of the Iraqi Christian and
                            Jewish communities, wealthy Iraqi businessmen resident in Beirut,
                            Kurdish rebel leader MULLA MUSTAPHA BARZANI's Beirut representative, and
                            Lebanese Christian politicians such as ex-President Camille Chamoun and
                            Henry Farun. The organization was to furnish military and political
                            information on Iraq to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and
                            "certain neighboring states,” who were backing the group. The Kurdish
                            rebellion was to be reactivated to tie down the Iraqi army and prevent
                            it from doing its part against Israel. The group's objectives allegedly
                            were to overthrow the Ba'thi regime, abolish socialism, make peace with
                            Israel, and form a government of Arabs and Kurds which would be
                            supported by <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> members "headed by
                            the United States.” General al-Uqaily was to have been Defense Minister
                            in the new regime, and Dr. al-Bazzaz was said to have been aware of the
                            plan and to have supported it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Concern for the Iraqi Jews</p>
                        <p>Israeli and world reaction to the recent executions has centered on the
                            fact that nine of those hanged were Iraqi Jews. Fears have been
                            expressed about the fate of the remaining Iraqi Jewish community—once
                            totalling over 100,000 persons, but now reduced, mainly by emigration to
                            Israel, to about 3000. The Jewish community dates its beginnings in Iraq
                            from the Babylonian Captivity, and its remaining members are believed to
                            feel no allegiance to Israel. Some have complained that they might have
                            continued to lead a good life in Iraq, had it not <pb n="5" xml:id="d251-05" facs="d251-05"/>been for antagonisms generated by
                            Israel's emergence as a state. Nevertheless, Israel's claims to be the
                            homeland of Jews everywhere has had the effect of turning the remaining
                            Iraqi Jewish community, in the eyes of the local authorities, into a
                            potential fifth column, and the Arabs' feeling of humiliation at
                            Israel's hands has also been taken out on the local Jews. The Iraqi
                            Jewish community thus has for some years led an increasingly
                            circumscribed existence, with restrictions imposed upon its members'
                            property rights and freedom of movement, and they have been subject to
                            greater harassment since the June 1967 war.</p>
                        <p>Israeli Premier Eshkol, in denouncing the executions, told the Israeli
                            Parliament that nothing stands between the Jewish communities and
                            annihilation but "Israel and her strength.” In an interview over Baghdad
                            Radio after the hangings, Baghdad's Grand Rabbi Sasson Khaddouri denied
                            that the trials had been aimed at the Jews and stated that the
                            world-wide outcry on this basis against Iraq was "unjust,” that "Iraqi
                            Jews, like people of other religions, enjoy complete freedom to carry
                            out their religious rites and normal work.” Rabbi Khaddouri's carefully
                            phrased statement was doubtless intended to offset such remarks as
                            Eshkol's, which would confirm the Iraqis in their view that the local
                            Jews were instruments of Israel. Indeed the Iraqi Jews feared that any
                            intervention on their behalf by Israel might unleash a pogrom in
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Ba'thi Regime</p>
                        <p>The Ba'thi regime in Baghdad, which came to power through a coup d'etat,
                            sees itself beset by plotters on every side. Its fears are no doubt
                            justified because it has progressively alienated virtually every other
                            significant political and ethnic grouping in Iraq. Moreover, the Ba'this
                            are threatened by internal schism and the possibility of a coup attempt
                            by one of their own factions against another. During their seven months
                            of power, the Ba'this have been so preoccupied with trying to shore up
                            their position that governmental decision-making has been at a relative
                            standstill, and it is unclear who speaks with authority for the regime.
                            The Ba'th has set up an extensive internal security apparatus as an
                            instrument of party control, but this apparatus seems to be operating
                            semi-independently, an its unruly and violent actions have only served
                            to discredit the regime. More important, despite a determined effort to
                            fill key military posts with at least nominal Ba'this, the regime is
                            unsure of the loyalty of the army. Ba'this still brood over the fact
                            that the last Ba'thi government in Iraq, in 1963, was unseated after
                            nine months by the Iraqi military (including some nominally Ba'thi
                            officers like <persName corresp="#p_THAAG1">Harden Tikriti</persName>)
                            because of the excesses of the radical elements of the regime.</p>
                        <p>The Ba'th returned to power in Iraq on July 17, 1968, when the so-called
                            Right-Wing Ba'thi group, made up of some of the more moderate members of
                            the 1963 Ba'thi regime, joined with several young officers in a
                            bloodless coup against the Arif government. Within two weeks, however,
                            on July 30, the Ba'this ousted their less politically experienced
                            military colleagues from power and assumed full control. <pb n="6" xml:id="d251-06" facs="d251-06"/>At first the re-constituted, by now
                            wholly Ba'thi regime sought to broaden its narrow political base. It
                            entered into contacts with Kurdish rebel leader MULLA MUSTAPHA BARZANI,
                            it called for a coalition of "progressive forces" under Ba'thi
                            leadership, and released many political prisoners, including Communists,
                            as a token of good faith. Meanwhile, to offset their numerical weakness,
                            the Ba'this set out to appoint Ba'th party personnel to as many key
                            administrative and internal security posts as possible. The regime also
                            recalled to active service many Ba'thi officers who had been eliminated
                            from the army when the Ba'th was overthrown in 1963.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ba'thi Factionalism</p>
                        <p>A basic policy difference soon emerged over the question of how to
                            consolidate the regime. The more moderate faction urged cooperation with
                            non Ba'thi elements, especially among the military; the leader of this
                            group was Deputy Premier and Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_THAAG1">Harden Tikriti</persName>, who was believed to
                            have close ties with non-Ba'thi officers. A hard-line faction, led by
                            Interior Minister Saleh Ammash, called for excluding non-party elements
                            from key posts—especially in the military and internal security forces.
                            The Ammash group warned that the Ba'th had collapsed before because it
                            had equivocated on this point. A third prominent figure in the Ba'thi
                            leadership, Party Secretary General Saddam Tikriti, evidently endorsed
                            the hard-line approach, but seemed to have a personal following of his
                            own. President Ahmed Hassan al-<persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> did not enter the factional strife. He was believed
                            to incline more to the moderate approach, but seemed mainly concerned
                            with his own survival in office.</p>
                        <p>Potential allies of Harden Tikriti's moderate faction are two fellow
                            members of the ruling Revolution Command Council (which also includes
                            President al-<persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> and Saleh
                            Ammash)—Brigadier Sa'dun Ghaidan, now the commander of the Baghdad
                            Garrison, and Lieutenant General Hammad Shihab Tikriti, who recently was
                            made Iraqi Chief of Staff. These two were members of the young officer
                            group which cooperated with the Ba'this in Arif's overthrow; they
                            evidently soon became Ba'this by convenience and assisted in the
                            elimination of their non-Ba'thi colleagues from the regime. The validity
                            of their Ba'thi credentials, however, remains in question.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ba'thi Troubles with the Kurds</p>
                        <p>The five year Kurdish rebellion, led by <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah Mustapha Barzani</persName>, had subsided following a
                            cease-fire agreement arranged in 1966 under the Premiership of Dr. Abd
                            al-Rahman al-Bazzaz. The Iraqi government failed to implement the
                            agreement's provisions, however, and a renewal of hostilities
                            threatened. The Ba'this established contacts with Barzani in August 1968
                            in an apparent effort to reach a settlement. This effort was soon
                            nullified by a Ba'thi decision to support the "progressive" rival
                            Kurdish group of Jalal Talabani in a rather crude divide-and-rule
                            campaign designed to undermine Barzani, who reacted strongly to the
                            regime's duplicity. In a series of skirmishes, Barzani's numerically
                            superior forces inflicted losses on Talabani's followers, despite
                            Talabani's indirect support from the Iraqi army. Hostilities seem to
                            have been suspended by winter weather, but the Kurds expect the struggle
                            to be renewed on a larger scale in the spring.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Plots Thicken</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, rumors of plots have proliferated. In late September, the
                            regime claimed to have foiled a coup attempt by a combination of
                            Nasserists and Left-Wing or Syrian-oriented Ba'this, reportedly
                            encouraged by Damascus. Several persons were arrested, but there was
                            speculation that, whatever the dimensions of the actual plot, the regime
                            had used it as an excuse to round up a number of potential dissidents.
                            Among those jailed was a former Agriculture Minister, retired Major
                            General Abd al-Hadi al-Rawi.</p>
                        <p>October and November were marked by a growing number of beatings,
                            shootings, and arbitrary arrests carried out by members of the Ba'thi
                            security forces, who often seemed to be operating independently of
                            government control. The Chairman of the local Coca-Cola bottling company
                            was killed during interrogation by security men. A former Iraqi Foreign
                            Minister and Ambassador to Washington, Dr Nast al-Hani, was abducted and
                            murdered one night, reportedly by members of the security forces. Some
                            observers felt that the murder of al-Hani, a leading moderate, might
                            have been intended as a warning to other Iraqi moderates, who had turned
                            out in force at the Baghdad airport a few days earlier to welcome the
                            return of former Premier al-Bazzaz from a long stay in Beirut.</p>
                        <p>Despite the apparent effort by the regime to woo the dominant faction of
                            the Iraqi Communist Party, communist leaders were outraged when security
                            men reportedly fired on a demonstration previously authorized by the
                            government on the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, and several
                            demonstrators were killed or wounded. In another such episode, striking
                            communist workers were shot down at a Baghdad factory.</p>
                        <p>On December 11 reports reached Beirut that the Iraqi regime had put down
                            a coup attempt by officers associated with the long-defunct monarchy. On
                            December 27 the Iraqis reshuffled several top military posts, including
                            that of Chief of Staff. Non-Ba'thi incumbents were dismissed and
                            replaced by men considered more loyal to the regime. The regime
                            broadcast telegrams of support from key military units, but the event
                            bore all the hallmarks of a narrowly averted military coup.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Anti-American Campaign</p>
                        <p>The regime had already begun a campaign of harassment of American
                            educational institutions in Iraq. It expelled the American faculty
                            members of the Jesuit al-Hikma University and American personnel of the
                            American Philanthropic Society in Northern Iraq, a Protestant group
                            which had run a girls' school in Baghdad for many years, In December,
                            the anti-American campaign intensified, and other hitherto untouched
                            elements of the resident American community became targets. <pb n="8" xml:id="d251-08" facs="d251-08"/>An American technician and his
                            wife, on assignment with the Iraq Petroleum Company, were arrested and
                            kept under detention for several weeks on suspicion of espionage. Their
                            release was finally obtained by considerable US diplomatic pressure
                            through third countries. In January, several American wives of Iraqi
                            citizens, plus the American wife of a British <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> official, were detained without explanation. In
                            mid-January the American workers at an oil refinery were ordered to
                            leave the country without an explanation being given for their
                            expulsion. Throughout this period, a steady outflow of government
                            propaganda has pictured the US, in alliance with Israel, as the
                            relentless foe of Iraqi and Arab aspirations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discovery of a Fifth Column—Iraq in the Front
                            Lines</p>
                        <p>On December 4 the Israeli Air Force attacked Iraqi positions in northern
                            Jordan in retaliation for Iraqi artillery fire on Israeli settlements in
                            the Jordan valley. The Iraqis offered little effective defense and
                            suffered a number of casualties. This was the first time Iraq had
                            received a major Israeli blow since the June 1967 war, and the reaction
                            was electric. In the resulting pandemonium, an Iraqi soldier was
                            mysteriously shot in Baghdad. Also on December 4 a train was allegedly
                            attacked and robbed in northern Iraq by the Kurds. The Iraqi regime
                            chose to discern a pattern in these events. On December 5 President
                                al-<persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> addressed a mass
                            meeting in Baghdad and charged that while Iraq was facing the enemy on
                            the Arab-Israel front, a fifth column of agents of Israel and the US was
                            striking from behind. The two confessions, broadcast on December 14,
                            provided the theme. In early January, rumors began to sweep the Arab
                            countries predicting an imminent Israeli assault, probably aimed at the
                            Iraqi troops in Jordan. These rumors seemed to originate with the Iraqis
                            who were also the only ones to take them very seriously. Although the
                            attack has not yet materialized, the Iraqi regime seems almost to be
                            trying to provoke one—whether in response to its bluster in Jordan or to
                            the trials in Baghdad—as proof that Iraq is now Israel's principal
                            target and adversary.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>The next set of spy trials in Baghdad can be expected to develop further
                            the theme of a beleaguered Iraq, striving at home and abroad against the
                            Israeli/Imperialist menace. Although the Iraqis may have been somewhat
                            taken aback by the mildly unfavorable Arab reaction to the recent
                            executions, they will not be deterred in launching further trials by
                            concern for what Israel might do. An Israeli blow against the Iraqi
                            troops in Jordan would demonstrate only that Iraq was in the front lines
                            and that the threat from Israel was not imagined. (It should be noted
                            that the Iraqi troops in Jordan may be in a sense expendable in that
                            they have often been described as a convenient dumping ground for
                            military elements that the Iraqi regime does not trust to have at home.)
                            On the other hand, an Israeli action directed against Iraq might unleash
                            a pogrom there and would certainly be pointed to by the regime as proof
                            that the local Jews were in fact creatures of Israel. In either
                            instance, Israeli action would confirm Iraqi fears and tend to rally the
                            country behind the regime. <pb n="9" xml:id="d251-09" facs="d251-09"/>Although the present campaign of psychological mobilization may buy
                            the Ba'this a little time, their long range prospects will not be
                            improved. Like their rivals in Syria, whom they increasingly resemble,
                            the Ba'this in Iraq may totter on in defiance of gravity somewhat
                            longer. However, their inadequacies and internal flaws remain and their
                            collapse is inevitable—as a result either of factional infighting or a
                            military coup.</p>
                        <p>A successor regime is unlikely to be much more lasting or secure,
                            however. As long as factional intrigue and demagoguery remain the rule
                            in Iraq and the military is the final arbiter of power, such regimes
                            will rise and fall quickly, keeping the political scene in continuous
                            turmoil.</p>

                                Disputed North Rumaila Oilfield</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Iraq National Oil Company (INOC), an Iraqi governmental agency,
                            reportedly has sent formal invitations to thirteen (unspecified)
                            companies to submit tenders for preparing (on a turnkey basis) the North
                            Rumaila oilfield for production. Such an action by INOC would end
                            speculation on the nature of the oil policy of the Baathist regime in
                            Iraq. It would appear to be identical with that of the previous Arif
                            government. This paper examines the new action and its implications.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>The overthrow of the Iraqi government headed by 'Abd al-Rahman 'Arif
                            raised some hope in Western circles that Iraq's long-standing disputes
                            with the Western-owned Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) might be amicably settled. However, the new regime of
                            Ahmed Hasan Bakr has now reportedly taken steps which indicate that its
                            oil policy will be essentially the same as that of its predecessor. This
                            would mean that, whatever else might happen, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> will not get back the concession areas that the Iraqi
                            Government unilaterally took from it in 1961, the most important of
                            which was the known oilfield called North Rumaila.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> government has stated
                            that it will honor the commitments of the previous regime to the French
                            government-owned oil company <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>,
                            which had entered into a contract with INOC, the Iraq National Oil
                            Company, to explore for and produce oil in certain areas still claimed
                            by <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. The new government's <pb n="2" xml:id="d252-02" facs="d252-02"/>call for bids for the preparation
                            of North Rumaila for production indicates that, like the previous
                            government, it has decided to have INOC handle the development of that
                            field itself—by hiring whatever skills it may need, rather than by
                            turning over the field in toto, either under a managerial contract or by
                            concession, to a foreign oil company.</p>
                        <p>Before the change of government (and of INOC's management), INOC had held
                            discussions with several companies on just such an in-toto contract but
                            was dissatisfied with the net return it was offered by the companies.
                            Whether its own method of development of the field will yield as much as
                            it might have received from a foreign oil company is highly
                            questionable. Moreover, it will now have no built-in sales agreement for
                            the oil, a usual feature of in-toto contracts, and <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has indicated that it will use whatever
                            means are available to block any sales attempted by INOC.</p>
                        <p>It remains to be seen what <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> actually
                            can or will do in this respect. An attempt, particularly a successful
                            attempt, to block Iraqi exports of “<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s" oil could mean that in spite of the resultant probable
                            loss to Iraq, the government would nationalize <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s remaining holdings—its producing fields. On the other
                            hand, the major shareholders of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            (British Petroleum, Shell, Esso, Mobil, and the Compagnie Francaise des
                            Petroles) have important oil concessions in other countries that might
                            be endangered if <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> does nothing about
                            Iraqi exports of oil from expropriated concession areas. The governments
                            of these other countries might decide that if Iraq could expropriate and
                            not be penalized, they could do the same. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> hopes that Iraq can be persuaded to pay some
                            compensation for North Rumaila (and the other areas as well), which
                            would more or less legitimize the takeover. Otherwise, the company's
                            alternatives are not very attractive.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Background in Brief</p>
                        <p>The Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) and its
                            affiliates, the Basrah Petroleum Company (BPC) and the Mosul Petroleum
                            Company (MPC)(*) formerly held (and in their own view still hold) oil
                            concession, rights over most of Iraq. In 1961 the Iraqi Government
                            unilaterally rescinded these rights except in the limited areas where
                            the companies were already producing oil. The choicest of the areas
                            taken from the companies was one known as North Rumaila, where an
                            oilfield, which is an extension of the South Rumaila field already under
                            production by BPC, had been located and on which work had begun,
                            including the drilling of productive wells. The field had not, however,
                            been developed to the point of tying the wells in with BPC's existing
                            collection system or of constructing a new system. For many years after
                            1961, succeeding Iraqi governmental regimes had been unable to come to
                            any final decision on what to do with the concession areas taken back
                            from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and its affiliates.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (*) These three companies have the same shareholders in the

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Oil Policy and Actions of the 'Arif
                            Regime</p>
                        <p>Finally in 1967, under the 'Arif regime, the preempted areas were
                            definitively assigned to the governmental oil company INOC, which was
                            empowered to develop them itself or in conjunction with others but not
                            under a concession type of agreement. INOC entered into a contract
                            agreement with the French governmental company <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss> (Entreprise de Recherches et d'Activites Petrolieres),
                            under which <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss> would explore for and
                            produce oil in certain limited areas in southern Iraq for INOC's account
                            and would be permitted to purchase at an attractive price a portion of
                            the oil it might produce. The North Rumaila field was not included in
                            this agreement. Negotiations were also undertaken with a Yugoslav
                            company leading reportedly toward an <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>-type contract for another small area in southern Iraq
                            (not North Rumaila), but no agreement had been signed by the time the
                            regime was ousted. On North Rumaila itself, there were negotiations with
                            several foreign companies, but INOC finally announced that the offers
                            made by these companies were not sufficiently attractive and INOC would
                            develop the field itself.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> INOC Plans for North Rumaila</p>
                        <p>The general outline of INOC's plans called for a first phase of
                            development which would take about two years and cost six million Iraqi
                            dinars ($16.8 million). This stage would result in an annual production
                            of five million <pb n="4" xml:id="d252-04" facs="d252-04"/>tons of oil.
                            The profits from oil sales would be utilized to expand production in the
                            second phase to eighteen million tons a year. The oil would be marketed
                            through long-term contracts with independent refiners, and INOC claimed
                            to have a number of contract offers. Since neither INOC nor any other
                            Iraqi company or organization was capable of handling the development of
                            a new oilfield, there was speculation that it might be done with the aid
                            of Soviet or Eastern European technicians and equipment or by hiring
                            various specialist companies to undertake different parts of the job. In
                            fact, some well-drilling companies operating in the Persian Gulf area
                            were approached but turned down the opportunity because they were
                            reluctant to get on the wrong side of the powerful shareholders of
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Discussions were also held with
                            an Italian consulting engineering firm (Techint) and with the National
                            Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) over the possibility of their providing
                            assistance in developing the field. Finally, the commercial attaches of
                            various foreign embassies in Baghdad in late April 1968 received a
                            letter from the then Chairman of INOC announcing that INOC would soon be
                            inviting suppliers and contractors to tender, on a turnkey basis, for
                            projects involved in the development of North Rumaila. The attaches were
                            informed that if any companies or organizations of their countries
                            should be interested in tendering, INOC would be pleased to discuss the
                            subject with then.</p>
                        <p>The letter also outlined the work to be done. The first phase—to develop
                            an export capacity of five million tons of oil a year—was to consist of
                            work-over and completion of five wells, installation of the necessary
                            production and field facilities, construction of 130 kilometers of
                            16-inch pipeline, and improvement of terminal and loading facilities.
                            The "five wells" are presumably those already in existence-drilled by
                            BPC before the Iraqi Government excluded the company from the North
                            Rumaila area. The terminal and leading facilities are also in existence,
                            although they may need some reworking and updating. In order to avoid
                            another confrontation and some sticky questions of valuation, BPC has
                            offered to turn over to INOC its old terminal facilities at the port of
                            Al Faw (Fao) near the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab, now unused except in
                            emergencies, since BPC has a newer deep-water terminal offshore at Khor
                            al-Amaya. The second phase—to raise export capacity to eighteen million
                            tons a year—was to consist of the drilling and equipping of twenty
                            wells, installation of the required production and field facilities, 150
                            kilometers of 32-inch pipeline, and an offshore loading terminal with
                            submerged pipelines. It was intended that all contracts be awarded on a
                            turnkey basis; however, "other suitable alternatives [would] also be
                            considered.” Presumably, a company with the necessary qualifications
                            could bid on more than one, perhaps all, of the stages of each
                            phase.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Oil Policy of the New Regime</p>
                        <p>After the change of regimes in Iraq in July 1968, the new (Bakr)

                            and other observers who considered it too favorable to <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>. As for North Rumaila, the first
                            indication of the new government's approach was a tentative inquiry as
                            to whether BPC would undertake a contract to produce and deliver certain
                            quantities of North Rumaila oil through its own facilities <pb n="5" xml:id="d252-05" facs="d252-05"/>to Al Faw for INOC's account. The
                            Government did not follow up this idea, and it would now appear that the
                            new regime has adopted more or less in toto the plans of the old regime.
                            The thirteen companies to which invitations to bid have reportedly been
                            sent are probably those which indicated their interest in response to
                            the letter or letters sent out by the former regime. They are believed
                            to include firms (or state agencies) in Eastern Europe, in some Western
                            European countries, and in Japan, but not in the US or Britain. No new
                            disclosures have yet been made to indicate what arrangements the new
                            regime contemplates for financing the development of North Rumaila and
                            for marketing the oil but presumably they too are more or less the same
                            as those the old regime had in mind. The cost of the first phase of
                            development, although it may turn out to be substantially greater than
                            the original estimate of about $17 million, should not be beyond the
                            resources of the Iraqi Government, particularly since the successful
                            contractor will probably have to provide, or assist in finding, at least
                            partial medium- or long-term financing for the project. Some contracting
                            companies or organizations might well be willing to take payment in oil,
                            when it is available. Even if first-phase development costs should tun
                            as high as $25 million, this amount would represent little more than
                            half a year's output of oil at the five-million-ton rate.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Profitability of North Rumaila Under INOC
                            Management</p>
                        <p>Reportedly, when the development of North Rumaila under an <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>-type contract was being negotiated by
                            the previous government, the highest offer made by any interested
                            company would have netted INOC $1.12 per barrel of oil. Although INOC
                            did not publicly reveal the offers that were received, it did announce
                            that they were not good enough and gave an estimate of what it could
                            expect to realize by going ahead on its own. Net return was estimated at
                            $1.20 a barrel, assuming a posted price of $1.76 a barrel, a discount of
                            40 cents (since posted prices now bear little relation to realized
                            prices), and production costs of 16 cents a barrel. INOC may yet be
                            sorry the $1.12 offer was not accepted. In the first place, the posted
                            price at the crude oil terminal of Khor al-Amaya for crude with an
                                <gloss target="#t_API1">API</gloss> gravity of 34.0-34.9 degrees is
                            $1.70, not $1.76. Oil from the main pay zone of the North Rumaila field
                            is reportedly of 34.5° API gravity and from the other two known lesser
                            pay zones is 33° and 27° API. If INOC chooses to shut off the subsidiary
                            pay zones and draw only from the main zone, the posted price would still
                            be only $1.70. With a discount of 40 cents a barrel and production costs
                            of 16 cents, the net profit would be reduced to $1.14 a barrel. INOC
                            could, of course, reduce its discount to something less than 40 cents.
                            With Persian Gulf realized prices continuing to slide downhill, and
                            considering the risks a purchaser would run in contracting with the
                            less-than-reliable Iraqis while incurring the displeasure of not only
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s shareholders but probably many
                            other oil producers as well, INOC could well find itself compelled to
                            offer more than a 40-cent discount. Moreover, the 16-cent production
                            cost assumed by INOC is presumably based on BPC's costs for the South
                            Rumaila and Zubair fields. It will be somewhat surprising if
                            inexperienced and inefficient INOC, even with outside technical
                            assistance, can keep <pb n="6" xml:id="d252-06" facs="d252-06"/>its unit
                            costs on a relatively small volume of production down to the level
                            attained by the experienced BPC on a considerably larger volume.</p>
                        <p>It is true that INOC's initial capital costs will be low-with no
                            exploration necessary, with the initial wells already drilled, and with
                            the terminal facilities already in place—but presumably the second phase
                            of development, involving full capital costs, will begin as soon as the
                            first phase is completed. Even when the second phase is completed, the
                            expected production of 18 million tons a year will approximately equal
                            BPC's 1964 output, in which year BPC's costs were over 19 cents a barrel
                            (not including payments to the government). With a 40-cent discount and
                            costs of 19 cents a barrel, INOC's net return even on its second-phase
                            production would be one cent less than the highest offer by an outside
                            company, and there is reason to believe that INOC will be extremely
                            fortunate to do that well. However, whether or not INOC makes the profit
                            it hopes to make, it will undoubtedly make a profit, provided it can
                            sell the oil. Inefficient as it may be, its production costs can hardly
                            be expected to rise to the point of eliminating all profit, even if it
                            finds that it must offer a more substantial price discount on its sales
                            than it had expected to give.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Can INOC Sell Its Oil?</p>
                        <p>It is probable that INOC could dispose somewhere of at least the
                            first-phase production of five million tons a year from North Rumaila.
                            One fairly large refinery could take it all, although a refinery with a
                            capacity of five million tons might be reluctant to tie itself to a
                            long-term contract with one possibly erratic supplier and would probably
                            need more than one grade of crude. How much success <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> or its shareholders would have in any
                            attempts to prevent consummation of sales through legal actions or
                            commercial pressures is questionable. It is unlikely that they could
                            close all doors, even in free-world countries, let alone in Eastern
                            Europe. The French Government, for instance, has obviously chosen to
                            ignore <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s claims to its former
                            concession areas in Iraq, since <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>
                            has entered into an oil production contract with INOC for certain
                                ex-<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> territories. In fact, <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss> may be one of the thirteen companies
                            INOC has invited to bid on the development of North Rumaila. The French
                            Government is aware that its regulatory powers give it a life-and-death
                            hold over the very substantial refining and marketing interests of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> shareholders in France. Any
                            attempt to prevent <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss> from lifting
                            the oil it may find in Iraq or, for that matter, from developing North
                            Rumaila and buying the oil from INOC, would almost certainly provoke
                            French Government retaliation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What Will <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> Be
                            Able To Do?</p>
                        <p>It remains to be seen what <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> can or
                            will do when INOC or its contractors begin to export oil from Iraq. When
                            the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's Iranian holdings were nationalized in
                            1951, the company, assisted by the other major oil producers (and by
                            Iranian ineptitude as well) was able to prevent more than <pb n="7" xml:id="d252-07" facs="d252-07"/>token sales by Iran, most of which
                            were subsequently immobilized by litigation. However, the major oil
                            companies at that time controlled ninety percent or more of the
                            available market and controlled or were able to influence most of the
                            available tanker transport. This is no longer true to the same extent,
                            especially now that Eastern European countries are looking for crude
                            from other than Soviet sources. There would seem to be relatively little
                            IPC could do either by legal action or commercial pressure against the
                            Eastern European countries or in fact against a number of the
                            less-developed countries in the free world, unless for instance, the
                            tankers carrying the "misappropriated" oil were to put in at a port
                            where it would be possible to take legal action to attach their cargoes.
                            Pressure brought to bear upon tanker owners to refuse to charter to INOC
                            or its oil purchasers would presumably have no effect upon Communist
                            country tankers, and some free-world owners willing to take a risk could
                            probably be found, especially as within a couple of years the tanker
                            market is likely to be glutted again. Moreover, Anglo-Iranian was free
                            to go all out against Iran since it had nothing left to lose there.
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has a good deal more to lose in
                            Iraq, and while the Iraqis would themselves undoubtedly take a heavy
                            loss by nationalizing <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s present
                            producing fields, their emotional response to "imperialist pressures"
                            might well persuade them to do it at whatever cost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Other Side of the Coin</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> does nothing to
                            prevent the lifting of "its" oil by INOC, <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>, or other oil purchasers, or if it makes the attempt
                            and is notably unsuccessful, other producing countries in which <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s shareholders have important interests
                            might consider that the door was open for them to do what Iraq has done.
                            The Iranian Government, for instance, has already threatened to take
                            over a producing field from the Iranian Oil Consortium. The Iranians
                            appear to be taking considerable interest in the outcome of Iraq's
                            venture into the partial unilateral abrogation of its concession
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">When Does the Crunch Come?</p>
                        <p>The question of preventing Iraqi sales of oil will probably not arise in
                            the immediate future. INOC, or at least its previous management, had
                            estimated the time required for the first-stage development of North
                            Rumaila at about two years, to which must be added the time it will take
                            to come to agreement with a company (or state agency) over the details
                            and the price of the job. At present, the Iraqi Government seems
                            incapable of making final decisions on anything, let alone a sensitive
                            and complex subject like oil development. <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>, which has drilled one dry hole in Iraq, might take
                            somewhat less time than INOC to begin exporting if it finds oil but
                            probably not much less than two years. It may be noted that <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has taken no legal action to prevent
                                <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss> from exploring and drilling
                            for oil in areas still claimed by <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>.
                            Legal action in Iraq would presumably have been useless, but it might
                            have been possible for <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> or some of
                            its shareholders to proceed against <gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss> in France. However, any such move, certainly if it
                            were successful, would have invited retaliation by the French
                            Government. Whether <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> can take legal
                            action against companies <pb n="8" xml:id="d252-08" facs="d252-08"/>that
                            night undertake the development of North Rumaila for INOC would depend
                            upon their country of origin. If the "company" were an Eastern European
                            state agency, it seems improbable that anything could be done, and if it
                            were French, it night be impolitic to do anything.</p>
                        <p>If there then appears to be no prior action that is useful or desirable,
                            In has two or three years before it must finally decide whether or not
                            to go all out to block, or attempt to block, Iraqi exports of oil.
                            Presumably, IPC is devoutly hoping that something will happen in the
                            meantime to obviate the decision—e.g., a settlement of some sort that
                            will at least partially compensate <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            for its loss of concessionary rights and make it appear that Iraq did
                            not get off-scot-free with its unilateral abrogation of those rights. In
                            fact, Iraq will not have got off scot-free even if it is able to sell
                            oil with no difficulty. It has sacrificed hundreds of millions of
                            dollars in potential revenue from the increased production that might
                            have been expected during the seven years or so that have already passed
                            since <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> was precluded from further
                            exploration and the development of new fields. However, this thought
                            might have little effect upon governmental officials of other producing
                            countries, who might believe that they would not be afflicted by the
                            same indecision as the Iraqis and could immediately increase their
                            country's total production by a similar abrogation of existing
                            concession rights.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s choices in this matter, assuming
                            no settlement with the Iraqi Government, are not attractive. If the

                            properties in Iraq. If the company does nothing or, even worse, if it
                            tries to block the sales and does not succeed, its shareholders'
                            properties in other countries say be endangered. It will seem, at least
                            to the less discerning, that abrogation of concessions incurs no
                            penalty. Although <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> is not renowned
                            for flexibility and appears at present to be determined to take action
                            if there is no settlement of its dispute with the Iraqi Government, it
                            remains to be seen what it will and can do when the time for action
                            arrives.</p>

                        <p>Your Meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName>
                            in Brussels</p>
                        <p>During your meeting in Brussels with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Marcel Dupret</persName>, the following topics are
                            very likely to come up:</p>
                        <p>Protection of US Interests in Iraq - You might express to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> our profound
                            appreciation for his outstanding defense of US interests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Paul T. Bail - In particular, you might express our
                            appreciation for his handling of the Bail case. This case was a
                            tremendous burden on him both before he secured their release and in the
                            period afterward when he was obliged to have them as house guests.
                            Dupret may complain about our making a statement to the press while Mr.
                            Bail was still in jail. If so, you may wish to point out to him that the
                            press had already learned of Bail's imprisonment and that we were
                            obliged to answer a question raised at the noon press briefing. Time
                            factors prevented our clearing this in advance with Dupret.</p>
                        <p>Threat to Embassy Properties - You may wish to reiterate to Dupret the
                            fact we have no intention of selling the Embassy property to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. At the same time we do not wish to
                            refuse outright for fear it would precipitate seizure of the Embassy. We
                            fully appreciate the difficult position this puts <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> in and we regret it very much,
                            but we see no reasonable alternative. In this connection, reports I have
                            received from various sources indicate that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is in the process of taking over a number of buildings
                            in the area of the Presidential Palace. Even the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> headquarters, which you will recall are several blocks
                            away, have been threatened.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d254-02" facs="d254-02"/>
                        <p>American Officer on <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName>'s Staff
                            - Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> on several
                            occasions in the past has asked that we assign a third secretary to the
                            U.S. Interests Section of the Belgian Embassy as is provided for by our
                            agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. We have refused
                            and we still do not wish to send an officer. One reason is that he would
                            be so completely circumscribed by Iraqi security that he would be able
                            to perform no useful function other than housekeeping chores in the
                            Embassy. This, in our opinion, does not justify the problems involved in
                            trying to support and maintain communications with a lower ranking
                            officer in Baghdad. Also, given the capriciousness of the Iraqis, he
                            would be subject to being declared persona non grata on the least
                            pretext.</p>
                        <p>Prospects for Resumption of Relations - You may wish to tell Dupret that
                            our view from Washington is that the prospects for resumption of
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> are as remote as
                            ever. The Iraqi Government is obviously hostile to the United States and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has made it abundantly clear
                            that it does not wish to resume relations. We do not intend to take the
                            initiative, but we would be happy to consider the question should the
                            Iraqi Government indicate an interest. You might add for Dupret's
                            background that under the present deteriorating conditions in Iraq we
                            are not particularly eager to resume relations. If and when relations
                            are resumed, we would have very few conditions and the main ones would
                            be (1) that the Iraqis agree in principle to compensate us for damage to
                            the Embassy and the Consulate in Basra, (2) that the boycott of American
                            goods be rescinded and (3) that overflights of US civil aircraft be
                            permitted.</p>
                        <p>Basra Consulate - We have no intention of reopening our Consulate in
                            Basra, and we therefore hope to sell the land and buildings. Under the
                            present conditions in Iraq it is doubtful that there are many buyers,
                            but we would be pleased to consider any offers. FYI FBO's asking price
                            is $1 million but this, of course, is subject to negotiations. Book
                            value of the property is about $500,000. End FYI.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d254-03" facs="d254-03"/>
                        <p>Security Situation - You might tell Dupret that our assessment is that
                            the security situation in Iraq has deteriorated sharply over the last
                            few months. It is not entirely clear to us who is in control in the
                            country. For this reason we still have an outstanding instruction to all
                            posts to advise Americans contemplating travel to Iraq that we do not
                            think they should go there unless they have compelling reasons to do so.
                            You may wish to invite Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> to comment on the situation in Iraq.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You asked me last night to review what we have done so far on the tragic
                            question of the Iraqi Jews. Here wrap-up on the past as well as on our
                            reactions to the WILLIAMS-Scott Resolution.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. What have we done publicly?</p>
                        <p>Publicly, we have condemned the executions and public hanging of bodies.
                            The Secretary made a statement, Yost addressed a letter to <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant, and McCloskey has made at least two
                            public statements to this effect. We have been reluctant to say more
                            publicly because (1) the Iraqi government is very hostile to us and any
                            overt evidence of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest might be
                            used as an excuse to persecute the Jews further and (2) as a practical
                            matter, we have no influence with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and cannot hope to persuade the Iraqis to change their
                            handling of what they regard as entirely a domestic matter.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. What have we done privately</p>
                        <p>We have confidentially asked the French Government to intervene. To date,
                            the French have not reported any success. Starting in the fall of 1967
                            we asked the Spanish to The Spanish Ambassador in Baghdad made a number
                            of approaches at various levels in the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. He was finally told in no uncertain terms to stay out
                            of Iraqi domestic affairs. Following the executions in January, the
                            Spanish Government, on its own initiative, asked the Egyptian Government
                            to intervene. We have no report on the outcome of this endeavor.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d255-02" facs="d255-02"/>
                        <p>We have asked Ralph Bunche to have <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant
                            appeal to the Iraqis. <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant has done so,
                            but we have no indication that the Iraqis ever replied. We have also
                            asked the assistance of the International Committee for the Red Cross
                            and that of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commission for
                            Refugees. Neither of these organizations appears to have any influence
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I tried my best to get the Indians (who represent the Iraqis here)
                            involved in this, on humanitarian grounds, and Banerjee promised to
                            help. It appears, though, that they never really tried and my impression
                            is that they would rather stay out of this. They did try to help on the
                            Bail case and made a rather tough demarche in Baghdad.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. What else could be done — diplomatical with
                            other Arab or other governments?</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, there is little that can be done diplomatically. The Iraqi
                            Government is so torn by internal dissension and political rivalry that
                            it is basically impervious to world opinion. Very few nations have any
                            influence whatsoever with Iraq. The Fench and Spanish have marginal
                            influence and we have used them. Other nations with influence—such as
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Communist China—would
                            hardly be receptive to our request for intervention. Pakistan has some
                            influence, but it is so limited that it is doubtful that it would risk
                            what little influence it has on such a dubious venture. Thus, until
                            there is a change in government, which could occur at any time, there is
                            little that can be done.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Our attitude toward the WILLIAMS-Scott
                            Resolution; i.e. should we endorse or keep quiet?</p>
                        <p>As noted above, official <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest in
                            the Jews might only further prejudice them. While we should keep quiet,
                            we could and probably should tell Senators WILLIAMS and Scott what we
                            have done and why we are reluctant to do anything more.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Should we make a public statement welcoming
                            the Iraqi Jews, and reaffirming that our immigration laws permit them to
                            enter?</p>
                        <p>Again, it is the public aspect that is troublesome. We have had a deluge
                            of Congressional correspondence on this subject, and in all cases we
                            have been able to report that under existing legislation we can take the
                            Iraqi Jews as refugees. Many other nations have indicted a willingness
                            to do the same. We could reiterate this to Senators WILLIAMS and Scott.
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d255-03" facs="d255-03"/>The only real problem is
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will not permit the Jews to
                            depart. All other potential problems, such as transport, resettlement,
                            etc., can be handled with ease once the first hurdle is overcome.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you telephone Senators WILLIAMS and Scott to express
                            understanding of their action and to explain what we have done and why
                            we would be reluctant to take a strong supportive public role. You might
                            say something to Ambassador Lucet about this matter at some appropriate
                            time. So long as the French have some capital in the Arab world, they
                            might have some influence if they should wish to spend some of it.</p>

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> said that there
                            was no question about the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s strong
                            desire to acquire the Embassy property for security reasons. In his
                            opinion there was no anti-American feeling involved: the government
                            planned to convert the entire area between the main Karadat Mariam road
                            and the Tigris River and between the two bridges into an official
                            compound in which all government activities would be concentrated. It
                            was proceeding with expropriations to accomplish this (see attached
                            map).</p>
                        <p>In addition, it planned an inner security area for the Palace. To
                            accomplish this, a dog-leg around the curve in Mansour Street would be
                            built so that the entire point of land formed by the curve of the river
                            could be sealed off and protected. The most vulnerable side of the
                            Palace complex was that of the American Embassy compound which
                            adjoined.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> said that in the
                            turbulent atmosphere that is likely to prevail in Iraq, the Embassy is
                            badly located insofar as its own security is concerned. During the
                            attack on the Palace in the Fall of 1968, he had watched from across the
                            river and seen the firing around and over the Embassy buildings: one
                            shell had fallen in the garden of the Residence.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, the Ambassador thought the U.S.G. had three
                            options. First, it could continue to disregard the request and try to
                            put it off for as long as possible. In this case, he thought the
                            government would begin to harass American citizens and interests. If we
                            took this position, <pb n="2" xml:id="d256-02" facs="d256-02"/>we should
                            develop some contingency plans to mount counter pressures. He thought we
                            probably wanted less from Iraq than the Iraqis wanted from us. He
                            thought we might consider such things as ousting the Iraqi Interests
                            Section from Washington, making it difficult for Iraqis to get into the
                            U. S. for technical and academic training, restricting exports of
                            essential spares for the American-equipped sector of the Iraqi economy,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>A second option was to agree to the Iraqi request to send a team of
                            officials to Baghdad to negotiate a settlement of the question. He
                            advised against this unless we had reached a decision to sell.</p>
                        <p>The third option was to authorize the Belgian Embassy to negotiate with
                            the Government of Iraq to get a formal note requesting purchase of the
                            Embassy property and affirming an oral commitment given him by the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            would not confiscate or nationalize the property but would resolve the
                            question through negotiations. We should, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DM5">Dupret</persName> thought, agree to turn over the
                            property only after the Government of Iraq had made available a
                            replacement in the form of equivalent property and buildings constructed
                            to our specifications.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that on my return to Washington I would put the
                            problem to my colleagues and forward a recommendation for approval at
                            higher levels. I agreed with him that some answer had to be made to the
                            Iraqis.</p>
                        <p>On a related matter, the Ambassador said the Iraqi guards who occupied
                            the date grove between the Embassy and the Palace had begun to raise the
                            height of the wall of the compound, apparently as part of a general
                            effort to improve security. Although a raised wall would have the
                            advantage of cutting off the view of soldiers who thronged to the roofs
                            of shacks next door to look at the girls in the Embassy pool, he had
                            protested to the Foreign Ministry on the basis of failure to get
                            permission of the owner and the work was stopped. At his behest, the
                            Foreign Ministry had given him a note officially requesting him to seek
                            U.S.G. approval for raising the wall.</p>

                            involve any expense for the U.S.G. and that it would be of similar
                            construction to the existing wall, I thought we could give approval.

                            <lb/> Chairman<lb/> Committee on Foreign Affairs<lb/> House of
                            Representatives<lb/> Washington, D.C. 20515</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on House Resolutions
                            226 and 227 on the subject of the recent executions in Iraq.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State announced publicly on January 27 that the
                            executions in Iraq were, on humanitarian grounds, a matter of deep
                            concern to the United States and that they presented a spectacle that
                            was repugnant to the conscience of the world, On behalf of this
                            Government Ambassador Yost sent a letter on January 29 to the President
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council in which he
                            said that, although the United States recognizes the right of any
                            government to administer justice to any of its citizens, the manner in
                            which the Government of Iraq conducted the trials and executions
                            scarcely conform to accepted standards of human rights and human
                            dignity. He also stated that the spectacular nature of these trials and
                            hangings seemed designed arouse emotions and intensify the explosive
                            situation in the Middle East, and that their repetition would make more
                            difficult the search for peace in that area of the world.</p>
                        <p>Since seven additional persons —all Moslems— have been executed in
                            Baghdad under circumstances similar to those attending the executions of
                            January 27. (For your information, only eleven of the fourteen executed
                            on <pb n="2" xml:id="d257-02" facs="d257-02"/>January 27 were hanged in
                            Baghdad the other three executions took Place in Basra. Although none of
                            the executions was actually carried out in public, the bodies were later
                            displayed for several hours on gibbets in the central squares of both
                            cities.)</p>
                        <p>While we are, therefore, fully sympathetic to the concern that prompted
                            the resolutions, we do not believe it would be advisable from a
                            practical standpoint for the United States to seek a Security Council
                            meeting for the purpose of preserving the human rights of the people of
                            Iraq. Even if it should do so, we doubt that Council consideration would
                            be likely to influence the Government of Iraq in the direction of better
                            observance of human rights. Indeed, Security Council discussions of the
                            subject, with the harsh words and hardened positions that sometimes
                            characterize them, can have a negative effect on the condition and
                            prospects of the people of Iraq, especially those in minority
                            status.</p>
                        <p>As a practical matter, the only means that could help improve the
                            situation would be those that obtain the cooperation of the Government
                            of Iraq. Since the United States has no representation in that country,
                            and in view of the intensity of anti-American feeling on the part of
                            official circles there, we have acted in the belief that initiatives
                            toward alleviating the plight of minority groups should best be
                            undertaken by third parties. Accordingly, we have cooperated actively in
                            this regard <pb n="3" xml:id="d257-03" facs="d257-03"/>with friendly
                            governments, voluntary agencies and international organizations. We will
                            continue to do so, in the conviction that the interests of those Iraqis
                            deprived of their human rights are better served by such quiet and
                            persistent efforts than by apublic approach that could worsen their
                            plight.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of the Budget advises that from the standpoint of the
                            Administration's program there is no objection to the submission of this
                            report.</p>

                        <p>The Assyrian gentlemen called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> at their request. Mr. Yonan introduced Messrs.
                            Isma'il and Andrews stating that they had recently been in Kurdistan and
                            had some information which they wished to share with us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews said that he and Mr. Isma'il had gone to Iran in early April
                            1969. Through the intercession of the Assyrian representative in Majlis,
                            they were able to obtain permission— apparently from the Shah himself—to
                            visit Mullah <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mustafa Barzani</persName> in
                            Kurdistan. A primary purpose of their visit was to ascertain the
                            condition of Assyrians in Kurdish territory. The Iranian armed forces
                            obligingly provided a helicopter to take them into Kurdistan. They
                            arrived there April 20 and departed April 23.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d258-02" facs="d258-02"/>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews said they had long talks with <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName> every evening. The <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah</persName> gave them a letter addressed to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. The letter, a
                            copy of which is attached, will be officially delivered next week by
                            them in the company of the Kurdish representative in Washington, Shafiq
                            Qazzaz. They permitted us in confidence to make a copy of the letter for
                            our own information. <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH
                                MUSTAFA</persName> had specifically asked Messrs. Andrews and
                            Ismatil to convey a message to the American Government. That is, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah</persName> wants us to know that
                            he is under pressure from his followers to unleash attacks on the Kirkuk
                            oil facilities. The Kurds will give serious consideration to this in the
                            future. The rationale is that the oil earns income for the Iraqi
                            Government which in turn is used to buy arms to attack the Kurds. In
                            reply to a specific inquiry from Mr. Baas, Mr. Andrews said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName> was not
                            demanding anything from us in return for agreement not to attack the
                            Kirkuk facilities. <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName>
                            merely wanted us to be informed. Mr. Andrews said that, of course,
                            Barzani looks for support from any quarter. He added that the <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah</persName> said he would like to see
                            Kurdistan become the 51st state.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the threat to the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            facilities at Kirkuk, Andrews and Isma'il seemed to be unaware of the
                            March 1969 attack on the facilities. (This is puzzling, since the Kurds
                            have publicly taken credit for the attack.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews said that the Assyrians are fighting the Iraqis alongside the
                            Kurds. There is apparently complete confidence between the Kurds and the
                            Assyrians and some integration of their fighting forces. In this
                            connection, Mr. Andrews said that the Iranian Government had assured him
                            of Iranian assistance to the Assyrians in their confrontation with the
                            Iraqis. In Tehran he had also gotten in touch with the Israelis. The
                            Israelis also assured him that they would be pleased to provide
                            Assyrians with arms. Mr. Andrews added that the Israelis are supplying
                            the Kurds with arms while the Iranians provide them <pb n="3" xml:id="d258-03" facs="d258-03"/>with food and other supplies.
                            Iranian support for the Kurds, Mr. Andrews noted, tends to vary in
                            direct proportion to tensions between the Iranian and Iraqi Governments.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName> had complained
                            to Mr. Andrews that when there is rapprochement between the Iraqis and
                            the Iranians, aid to the Kurds becomes a mere trickle. At times like the
                            present, the Kurds are well supplied by the Iranians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews reported that the Kurds enjoyed high morale and were
                            determined to carry on their war with the Government of Iraq. The
                            Iranians, the Israelis and the Kurds all agreed that even if <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName> were to die, the Kurds
                            were united enough in their confrontation with the Iraqis that they
                            would carry on the fight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews noted in passing that Jalal Talabani's forces are
                            ineffectual. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said that
                            we had heard about two months ago a rumor that Talabani had been killed
                            in a clash with the Barzani forces. Mr. Andrews said most emphatically
                            that Talabani is still alive. He said that at about the time we
                            understood that he had been killed, Talabani and a band of supporters
                            attempted to ambush Barzani and a group of his followers. The ambush
                            failed, and some 60 Talabani followers were killed. Both Talabani and
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> escaped unscathed.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>, Mr. Andrews said there are no negotiations
                            between Barzani and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews alluded to the possibility of US assistance to the Kurds and
                            Assyrians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> informed
                            the gentlemen that following the February 1964 truce between the Kurds
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, the US Government had
                            instituted a Title II program in northern Iraq to provide relief to
                            needy Kurds. This program had been terminated by the break in relations
                            between the United States and Iraq. In the absence of relations there is
                            little we can do to provide relief to needy minorities in that country.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> went on to say that we
                            are very sympathetic with all the minorities including the Kurds, <pb n="4" xml:id="d258-04" facs="d258-04"/>the Assyrians, the Jews, the
                            Chaldeans, and others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews said that he would get in touch with Shafiq Qazzaz and would
                            then be back in touch with Mr. Baas to arrange for an appointment to
                            deliver <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName>'s letter
                            to the Secretary. Mr. Andrews said he stands ready to be helpful in any
                            way possible and asked that we feel free to call on him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> thanked him and said we are
                            happy to have this new channel of communication.</p>

                            <lb/>Secretary of State of the United States of America</p>
                        <p>Greetings and respects.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency, you are aware of the fact that the people of Kurdistan
                            of Iraq have been for more than seven and a half years the victims of a
                            racial war waged against them by the dictators in Baghdad, who seized
                            power through bloody military coups.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the threat which this war has aimed at the existence and
                            legitimate aspirations of our people, both Kurds and Assyrians, it has
                            brought disaster and affliction upon all its victims, deprived the
                            people of Kurdistan, particularly the Assyrians and the Kurds, of
                            education and health [needs], and rendered tens of thousands of them
                            refugees. All these[calamities] have been inflicted upon us only because
                            we have claimed the basic and legitimate human and national rights, to
                            which we, like any other people, are entitled.</p>
                        <p>On more than one occasion, our people have appealed to the people and
                            Government of the United States of America for assistance in their
                            tribulation and inclusion in <pb n="6" xml:id="d258-06" facs="d258-06"/>your country's aid, in all fields, to many of the underdeveloped
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>As we reiterate our appeal to the people and government of the United
                            States through Your Excellency, we hope that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>'s administration may
                            usher in more propitious times for our cause, and that this appeal may
                            meet a receptive ear on your part and gain the necessary sympathy and
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Any serious step you may take towards this end will ensure for your
                            country the generous gratitude and support of our people, as well as
                            prove the best application of the policy of the United States, whose
                            objective is to serve humanity and stand by small nations subjected to
                            distress and suffering.</p>
                        <p>The delegation consisting of Shafiq Qazzaz, Zia Malak Ismail, and Sam
                            Andrews is authorized to speak on my behalf and to set forth in detail
                            the various aspects of our case. I am hopeful that the delegation will
                            enjoy the favor of an audience with you.</p>
                        <closer>Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.<lb/>

                                The conversation took place at the Department of State. According to
                                a memorandum of conversation, another delegation led by Sam Andrews
                                returned to the Department on January 30 to plead the
                                Kurdish-Assyrian case. <persName>Rodger</persName>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> responded that “while
                                the US does not have a significant national interest in the
                                situation in Iraq, the Iranian and Israeli governments apparently
                                do. We are not suggesting in any way that the Assyrians turn to them
                                for help, but it would be surprising if their apparent interest
                                would not encourage them to provide the support that is desired.”

                            <item>Mr. Bryan P. Baas, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>/ARN </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. Qazzaz stated that the principal purpose of his visit was to deliver
                            a letter from <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah Mustafa
                                Barzani</persName> to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName>. The letter appeals to the United
                            States to provide assistance to the Kurds and the Assyrians in their
                            struggle with the Iraqi Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> accepted the letter and assured the gentlemen
                            that it would be brought to the Secretary's attention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews and Mr. Isma'il related approximately the same story they had
                            given to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> on May 29
                            (see Memorandum of Conversation of that date). Mr. Qazzaz added a new
                            dimension to the problem by emphasizing that the Kurds felt compelled to
                            take decisive action against the Iraqi Government. He said it is more
                            imperative now than at any time in the past eight years that the Kurds
                            attack the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> oil installations and
                            interrupt the flow of oil. He noted that oil income is vital to the
                            Iraqi economy. If this income is denied the GOT, the economy will suffer
                            a severe blow and the government itself will be weakened to its very
                            foundation. The GOT would lack money to purchase arms and its war effort
                            would be severely impaired.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d259-02" facs="d259-02"/>
                        <p> W. Qazzaz asked for assistance from the United States Government. He was
                            not very specific, but he said the Kurds needed money to buy arms and
                            other supplies. He alluded to the sufferings of the Kurds in the north,
                            malnutrition among the children and lack of medical supplies. He said
                            that if the Kurds were provided with essential commodities they could
                            handle the Iraqis by themselves and would not need further help. He said
                            25,000 Kurds are now under arms. In response to a question about Iranian
                            and Israeli assistance, he acknowledged help from these sources but said
                            it was insufficient. Much later in the conversation, when it became
                            apparent that no US assistance was forthcoming, Mr. Qazzaz noted that if
                            the Kurds succeeded in gaining limited autonomy or independence, they
                            would not forget who had refused them aid when they needed it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> told the visitors quite
                            explicitly that the United States Government does not get into this type
                            of clandestine operation. Mr. Yonan alluded to the landings of the
                            Marines in Lebanon in 1958. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> pointed out that times have changed and that the
                            attitudes of the American public and American Government are quite
                            different on the subject of foreign adventures. The gentlemen apparently
                            understood quite clearly that clandestine assistance from the United
                            States was not forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> asked Mr. Qazzaz about
                            assistance for needy Kurds from international organizations. Mr. Qazzaz
                            said that the JCRC had provided some help to the Kurds through the
                            Iranian Red Crescent. He said that the American Red Cross had not been
                            helpful and he felt that that door was entirely closed to help from that
                            source.</p>
                        <p>Considering the Kurdish question from a humanitarian viewpoint, Mr.
                            Qazzaz said that the Kurds had made an appeal to <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant to have their problem brought before the Human
                            Rights Commission. Apparently, nothing resulted from this effort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> asked Mr. Qazzaz what
                            the Kurds have in mind doing with the assistance they are requesting.
                            Mr. Qazzaz said that the Kurds would like to cause the downfall of the
                            present Iraqi regime and have it replaced by a government that would be
                            more cooperative with the Kurds. He was not clear as to how this could
                            be brought about. He Insisted, however, that the Kurds would never
                            cooperate with an Iraqi Government that would not recognize Kurdish
                            rights. He also said that although the Kurds have not been demanding
                            independence — only limited autonomy and cultural integrity — he could
                            not vouch for their demands in another five or ten years. In other
                            words, the Kurds are completely fed up. They have absolutely no trust in
                            the Iraqi Arabs and they are becoming less inclined toward
                            compromise.</p>

                        <p>The Assyrian visitors stated that the Assyrians in Kurdish areas have
                            joined the Kurds in their rebellion against the Iraqi Government.
                            Assyrians fight side by side with the Kurds, and one of Idris Barzani's
                            bodyguards is an Assyrian: (Idris is Mullah's son and is a field
                            commander of the Kurdish forces.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> noted that Assyrian participation in the
                            insurgency entails a number of risks for the Assyrian community as a
                            whole in Iraq, which is more exposed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> assured the gentlemen
                            that the United States is sympathetic toward the sufferings of the Kurds
                            and the Assyrians. We do not however support an independent
                            Kurdish/Assyrian state, and we are not prepared to support this
                            objective either overtly or covertly. He added that the United States
                            has many interests in the area and had to take those interests into
                            consideration also. In conclusion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> said that he thought that this had been a useful
                            exchange and said he would be pleased to talk to the gentlemen again at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>As the gentlemen were leaving, Dr. Perley took Mr. Baas aside and said
                            that he really wouldn't look with favor upon an independent Kurdish
                            state because he knew that the Muslim Kurds at that point would
                            immediately turn on the Christian Assyrians.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Jaber reviewed the current state of affairs in Iraq emphasizing the
                            widespread unrest and resistance to the Baath regime. He noted that the
                            army is at war with the Kurds in the north, that there have been
                            anti-government demonstrations by the Shi'a in the south, that Iraqi
                            troops are stationed in Jordan and Syria and that the GOI has needlessly
                            provoked Iran. Disenchantment with the regime is general through the
                            country. Although there are many army officers and high-ranking
                            government officials that support the Baath regime, they are not
                            doctrinaire Baathis but are merely opportunists who would easily be
                            swayed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jaber expounded the theory that all Iraqi revolutions have been the
                            embodiment of popular sentiment. Going back to July 1958, he stated that
                            the revolution was truly popular and was supported by 99% of the people.
                            In February 1963, the Iraq populace had become thoroughly fed up with
                            Qassim and naturally welcomed the change in government. In November of
                            the same year the Iraqis were thoroughly disgusted with the Baath and
                            the thugs in the National Guard and were fully behind Abdul Salem's
                            revolution. The same situation, he said, obtains at present. The Iraqi
                            people have had their fill of the Baath regime and would quickly rally
                            behind a revolution. He feels the Baath is very insecure <pb n="2" xml:id="d260-02" facs="d260-02"/>and it would take very little to
                            bring it down. He noted in this connection that the majority of the
                            troops in the army are Shi'a, whereas the officers are Sunni, and he
                            suggested this could be an element in bringing about a revolution. Mr.
                            Baas asked whether the Shi'a troops would respond to an appeal from
                            Muhsin al-Hakim to mutiny against the Sunni officers. Mr. Jaber (who is
                            Shi'a) said that he really didn't know (1) if Hakim could be persuaded
                            to issue such an order or (2) if the troops would comply. The Shi'a
                            nevertheless are firmly opposed to the current regime and could be
                            counted upon to support a revolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jaber asked what support a new Iraqi Government could expect from the
                            United States if it were moderate, rightist and pro-West. (Mr. Jaber did
                            not ask at any time about assistance in bringing about the overthrow of
                            the Baath.) Mr. Jaber went on to explain that what he had in mind was
                            financial assistance to permit the new regime to establish itself
                            solidly. He noted that at the time of takeover by a new group, the
                            Treasury would probably be bare.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> told Mr. Jeber that if
                            a moderate group took over in Iraq and wanted U.S. recognition and
                            establishment of diplomatic relations, we would probably respond
                            promptly and positively. He noted, however, and Mr. Jaber agreed, that
                            prompt recognition by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would not
                            necessarily be helpful to a new regime attempting to establish itself.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> went on to explain
                            that there are some very real obstacles to the assistance of the type
                            envisaged. For one thing, in the absence of diplomatic relations there
                            are legislative prohibitions to providing assistance, and the only
                            possibility that occurred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> offhand was CCC credit. Even if relations were
                            established, it would be exceedingly difficult to obtain Congressional
                            authorisation for any type of aid program. With diplomatic relations
                            such things as Export-Import Bank credits and PL-480 would be
                            possibilities that could be explored. Mr. Jaber understood that prompt
                            material U.S. assistance was net something that could be counted
                            upon.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d260-03" facs="d260-03"/>
                        <p>Mr. Jaber said that he was proceeding to Beirut on the evening of July
                            17. He indicated that his trip was prompted by a cable he received a few
                            days ago. Although Mr. Jaber did not state the purpose of his trip to
                            Beirut, he left the distinct impression that it was concerned with a
                            conspiracy to unseat the Baath in Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the conversation, the possibility of commercial
                            financing for a new government was considered. It was noted that a
                            number of U.S. banks have a very real interest in doing business in Iraq
                            and have in the past been anxious to extend loans because of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s excellent repayment record. Also,
                            there are quarterly payments from the Iraq Petroleum Company. Mr. Jaber
                            indicated that he would give further consideration to private,
                            commercial sources of funding. He also indicated that he would be in
                            touch with us in the future.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>During the last few weeks rumors have circulated in Beirut to the effect
                            that Teymour Bakhtiar, former head of the Iranian intelligence service
                            who broke with the Shah and was exiled in 1961, is now in Baghdad
                            organizing an anti-Shah movement. Last April, when Iran abrogated its
                            1937 treaty with Iraq concerning navigation on the Shatt al Arab river,
                            Bakhtiar, who had only recently been released from prison in Lebanon,
                            sent messages to Iraqi President AHMAD HASAN AL <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> expressing his support of Iraq.
                            Baghdad press and radio at the time publicized a statement, allegedly
                            from Bakhtiar, urging the Iranian people to rise against the Shah. It
                            was also reported that Bakhtiar had asked for permission to reside in
                            Baghdad. Though there has never been any official indication from
                            Baghdad whether Bakhtiar's request was granted, reports from Tehran have
                            alleged he is in Baghdad and directing a group known as the "Movement
                            for the Liberation of Arabistan.”</p>
                        <p>On September 11 the pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> weekly as
                            Sayyad carried a long interview with Bakhtiar. Though the article did
                            not state where the interview had occurred, another article in the same
                            issue indicated that the interviewer, reporter Talal Salman, has
                            recently been in Iraq. The essence of the interview is as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d261-02" facs="d261-02"/>
                        <p>Bakhtiar believes Iran is on the brink of revolution. He accuses Iranian
                            authorities of deliberately provoking the crisis with Iraq over the
                            Shatt al Arab boundary to divert rising popular discontent with the
                            Shah. Since there had been no problem with Iraq over the Shatt al Arab
                            for more than thirty years, the timing of the present crisis shows that
                            the Shah has become the "ally of Israel and American imperialism”, which
                            are anxious to have Iraq withdraw her forces from the eastern front
                            against Israel. Bakhtiar described himself as leader of the "Iranian
                            Movement Abroad" against the Shah and, citing the example of Lenin,
                            said, "We must now struggle from abroad because we cannot enter
                            Iran.”</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: If in fact Bakhtiar is in Baghdad leading an anti-Shah movement,
                            it might represent Iraq's response to reports alleging an increase in
                            Iranian support of Kurdish leader Mulla Mustafa Barzanl. (The Beirut
                            press has on several occasions quoted the official Iraq News Agency to
                            the effect that Iranians have been infiltrating into northern Iraq to
                            join Mulla Mustafa forces. On September 13, Radio Baghdad claimed that
                            thirty Iranians had been killed and fourteen captured while trying to
                            infiltrate into northern Iraq.) It is hard to know how much in these
                            reports is fact, and how much fantasy. It would seem unlikely that
                            Bakhtiar would forsake the pleasures of living in Switzerland for ill
                            task of trying to organize, an anti-Shah movement, or that Bakhtiar
                            would join the Arabistan movement.</p>

                                two are in league. Sa'd spoke with great conviction and feeling that

                        <p>(In response to a telephonic request from Mr. Robert Anderson, I agreed
                            to meet with Mr. Obeidi for lunch to hear what he had to say about his
                            recent trip to the Middle East.)</p>
                        <p> Obeidi stated that the overthrow of the current Bathist regime in Iraq
                            by Iraqi emigres working with the Kurds and the Iranians, which had been
                            scheduled for the last week in August, had foundered on Iranian
                            stupidity and obstinacy. He claimed that the Iranians had put all their
                            money on one horse, a Colonel Mohamad Ali Sa'id, Commander of the Tenth
                            Armored Brigade, which defends Baghdad. The Iranians had offered Sa'id
                            L30,000 for his participation in the coup effort and had lapsed into the
                            complacent belief that he was the key to the whole operation.
                            Fortunately, according to Obeidi, the Deputy Commander of Sa'id's
                            Division got word to the Iraqi emigres plotting from London that Sa'id
                            was really playing a double game. He had informed the Iraqi regime of
                            the Iranian offer and, in return for a higher Bathist stipend, had
                            agreed to play the role of double agent. What Sa'id was supposed to do
                            was to entice the Iranian negotiators to Baghdad (presumably incognito)
                            for their next session, instead of meeting them at the border.
                            Presumably, once in Baghdad they would have been nabbed red-handed.
                            Obeidi said that the information concerning Sa'id's duplicity had forced
                            the Iraqi plotters to suspend the operation immediately. In this way <pb n="2" xml:id="d262-02" facs="d262-02"/>they had succeeded in
                            protecting their contacts in Iraq—whose identities would have been
                            surfaced to Sa'id in time. Obeidi claimed that the Iranians still are
                            not convinced that Sa'id is a double agent.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi listed other grievances which the Iraqi plotters had against
                            Iran, including Iran's failure to give Barzani enough arms or money. He
                            said that when Barzani was in Tehran recently the Iranians had given him
                            L50,000, an amount which Obeidi said was hardly enough to spark a
                            successful campaign from Kurdistan. Also, he claimed, the Iranians were
                            dragging their feet with regard to providing adequate arms. Barzani
                            needs, for example, anti-tank guns if he is to be effective against the
                            Iraqi military forces.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi expressed the view that even without the support of the Baghdad
                            garrison a successful revolt could be launched. When queried as to what
                            the revolters could do against the Iraqi Air Force, Obeidi said that the
                            plan had been to seize Kirkuk, Mosul and Habbiyeh simultaneously and
                            thus neutralize the Iraqi Air Force. Obeidi claimed that the Commander
                            of the Iraqi troops in Kurdistan is not a Ba'thist and is prepared to
                            join in the revolt once assured that the chances of success are
                            excellent. General Sa'id, on the other hand, is a Ba'thist with good
                            Ba'thist contacts. Nevertheless, Obeidi thought that if Sa'id could be
                            offered enough money (maybe L200,000) his mercenary propensities would
                            override his ideological affinities.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi said that al-Rawi, one of the key Iraqi emigres involved in the
                            plot, is now very discouraged and is being wooed by the Iraqi Ba'thists.
                            According to Obeidi, the Ba'thists are offering him money and an
                            ambassadorial position. He said that others in the plot, including the
                            Iraqi Ambassadors in Tripoli and Madrid, have endeavored to submit their
                            resignations to the Iraqi Government but these resignations have been
                            refused. Obeidi said that the reason for this was that the Iraqi
                            Government knows of their anti-regime activities and feels that it can
                            keep better tab on them, as well as inhibit their dissident activities,
                            by keeping them on as ambassadors. He alleged that some of the plotters
                            are now considering cooperating with the Syrian Ba'thists in the
                            latter's current efforts to overthrow the Baghdad Government.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d262-03" facs="d262-03"/>
                        <p> Obeidi expressed the understanding that Saudi Arabia had put some money
                            into the pot through Iran but he had some doubts as to whether this
                            money had ever gotten to Barzani. He said he feared the Iranian
                            officials are pocketing money destined for the Iraqi Kurdish rebellion.
                            He characterized the Iranians operating in the coup endeavor as being of
                            very low caliber. He wondered whether the Shah was aware of how poorly
                            the Iranians had handled the operation, since the Shah had once told an
                            Iraqi emigre-plotter that the group could rely on Iran's full support.
                            Obeidi said he was casting around for an effective way of bringing
                            directly to the Shah's attention the concern of the Iraqi emigres
                            regarding the botched Iranian effort.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi said that there are five different Iraqi emigre groups plotting
                            together and that each group claims to have well-placed contacts in
                            Iraq. The key problem is orchestrating the operation. He deplored the
                            fact that Salah Jabr, who had recently left the United States for London
                            and Tehran to help in the coup effort, had claimed that he had been in
                            contact with U. S. Government officials and had implied that he had
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support. Obeidi said that he had
                            called Jabr aside at one point and reprimanded him for making such
                            claims, whether true or not. He emphasized that making known any
                            identification with the USG would not be helpful. (I told Obeidi that we
                            also had been concerned at reports that had filtered back to us of
                            Jabr's claims to having <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support.
                            Obeidi evidently had not believed them.)</p>
                        <p> Obeidi said that one immediate problem facing some of the Iraqi emigres
                            is a home base. One result of the recent patching-up of Lebanese-Iraqi
                            differences had been a Lebanese undertaking to expel from Beirut certain
                            leading Iraqi emigre politicians. These included several of his friends,
                            who would have increasing difficulty in obtaining passports. He wondered
                            what we could do to help out. I indicated that they could apply for
                            immigration to the U.S., perhaps on the basis that they might be able to
                            qualify as bona fide political refugees. However, they would then have
                            to serve out their residence requirements and become American citizens.
                            When I wondered why the emigres could not obtain Iranian passports,
                            Obeidi said that the Iranians used the passports as a club. They
                            validated them for only six months and sought quid pro quos in return
                            for renewing the passports.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d262-04" facs="d262-04"/>
                        <p> Obeidi expressed concern that the momentum which had been generated last
                            summer for the coup effort was gradually slowing down and he thought
                            that after two or three months it would be difficult to sustain the
                            cooperation of the different groups. He expressed the view that unless
                            the Shah and perhaps King Faisal throw their full support behind the
                            coup effort and reverse the trend, they too would eventually go the way
                            of the other conservative regimes. Obeidi said that he thought that
                            Kuwait would be next on the list. He said that because the Kuwaiti
                            regime is afraid of Iraq, however, no support could be expected from
                            that quarter.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi asked if the United States Government could be of any assistance.
                            I replied emphatically in the negative. I said that I would be happy to
                            listen to what he had to say but obviously the United States Government
                            could not become involved. He wondered whether I could give him any
                            advice at all. He noted that the Shah was coming to the United States
                            and wondered whether this might not present an opportunity for a USG
                            official to talk to the Shah about the plight of the plotters. I said
                            that it would not be appropriate for us to do so but that Obeidi through
                            his American business or other contacts was free to try to establish
                            communication with the Shah.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi claimed that he was on the periphery of the plotting efforts
                            since "he is a businessman and not a politician" and that his job is
                            essentially as a go-between.</p>
                        <p> Obeidi also had some other comments to make. He said he had learned from
                            his colleague, the Iraqi Ambassador in Libya—who he said, is not in
                            sympathy with the regime, that the Iraqi Ba'thists have the inside track
                            in Libya. NASSER has been frozen out. As for internal politics in Iraq,
                            he expressed the view that Sadam Takriti is the strong man. He cast
                            aspersions at the British, alleging that they support the Baghdad
                            regime. I sought to disabuse him of this notion.</p>

                        <p>1. Department notes contradiction between Saab Jabr's expression of need
                            for assurances from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and reports from
                            intelligence sources that he has already assured his fellow conspirators
                            that he has <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> backing. Jabr's
                            assertion in paragraph 3 reftel that he would advise his group abandon
                            effort overthrow regime lacks credibility inasmuch as this group's coup
                            plans were never dependent on expression of support from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. It apparent that cohesion among
                            conspirators has broken down, and it also apparent that group's
                            cooperation with Iranian Government and with Kurds leaves much to be
                            desired. Jabr gives impression of desperately casting about to gain
                            support to put coup d'etat back on track. <pb n="2" xml:id="d264-02" facs="d264-02"/> FYI. Jabr intimated to Department Officer in
                            September 1969 that he expects be Foreign Minister if new government
                            formed. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>2. In any event, Jabr has already been informed in Washington that any
                            new moderate government in Baghdad could expect the same consideration
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would show to any other
                            friendly government. Jabr was also informed, as example, of routine,
                            non-political economic assistance available, such as Commodity Credit
                            Corporation and Export-Import Bank credits. He was given no assurances
                            in this respect but merely reminded of existence such programs and of
                            possible availability upon application after new government formed.</p>
                        <p>3. Upon Jabr's return to Beirut December 12, Embassy Officer McAndrew may
                            reply to his specific questions <pb n="3" xml:id="d264-03" facs="d264-03"/>as follows:</p>
                        <p>(a) We would assume that if a change of government were to take place in
                            Baghdad, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> would disburse quarterly
                            payment check to appropriate, new beneficiary. In the meantime,
                            Department does not propose suggest <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            make payment to anyone other than existing Iraqi Government, since
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has contractual obligation make
                            payment to Government. FYI. We have already received threat to pipeline
                            directly from Barzani headquarters. Pipeline extremely vulnerable and
                            there little preventive action that can be taken should Kurds find it in
                            their interest to stop oil flow. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>(b) We cannot consider provision of emergency supplies to coup plotters,
                            nor can we make advance commitment. As Jabr knows, we have had relief
                            programs <pb n="4" xml:id="d264-04" facs="d264-04"/>in Iraq in past, but
                            until new government formed and until new circumstances assessed, it
                            premature consider such program.</p>
                        <p>(c) Department unable provide Jabr with names of individuals with whom
                            his group might cooperate in staging coup d'etat or with whom they might
                            deal after successful coup. We assume Jabr's group has capability of
                            obtaining and evaluating such information.</p>
                        <p>(d) In summary, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> unable to become
                            involved in plotting against current Iraqi regime nor in making advance
                            commitments. Should new government prove to be moderate and friendly,
                            however, we would be prepared to consider prompt resumption of
                            diplomatic relations and would certainly be disposed to cooperate within
                            the limits of existing legislation and our overall policy. <pb n="5" xml:id="d264-05" facs="d264-05"/>In this connection, you may wish to

                        <p>1. INFORMATION ON EVENTS IN IRAQ NOW AVAILABLE TO FONOFF IS SIMILAR TO
                            REPORTS APPEARING LONDON PRESS DATELINED BEIRUT. FONOFF AND PRESS
                            DETAILS APPEAR BELOW. FONOFF IRAQ DESK (HINCHCLIFFE) TELLS US THAT IT
                            FAIRLY CLEAR THAT IRAQIS HAVE KNOWN ABOUT PLOT FOR SOME TIME AND
                            DELIBERATELY WAITED UNTIL LAST MINUTE TO NAB PARTICIPANTS. FURTHERMORE,
                            HINCHCLIFFE SAYS, FONOFF IS REASONABLY SATISFIED IRANIANS WERE INDEED
                            BEHIND ATTEMPT: RELATIVE RESTRAINT OF IRANIAN REACTION TO DATE MAY
                            REFLECT THEIR UNCERTAINTY OVER BEST RESPONSE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
                        <p>2. FONOFF'S LATEST FIGURES ON NUMBER OF PLOTTERS EXECUTED IS 41 WITH
                            UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF OTHERS JAILED FOR VARIOUS TERMS. WORD FROM
                            BAGHDAD INDICATES THAT IRANIAN AMBASSADOR AND FOUR OF HIS STAFF WERE
                            GIVEN BRUSQUE TREATMENT IN EXPULSION EXERCISE. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
                            BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES HAVE NOT RPT <pb n="2" xml:id="d265-02" facs="d265-02"/>NOT BEEN SEVERED AND, AT THIS MOMENT, FONOFF DOUBTS
                            FULL DIPLOMATIC RUPTURE WILL COME. PRESS REPORTS HERE SPEAK OF TROOP
                            MOVEMENTS BY BOTH COUNTRIES ON EITHER SIDE OF SHATT AL ARAB BUT FONOFF
                            HAS NO CONFIRMATION.</p>
                        <p>3. FONOFF INFORMATION INDICATES THAT IRAQI REGIME HAS IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT
                            IN PLOT FAIRLY WELL DOCUMENTED AND THAT BAGHDAD INTENDS TO EXPLOIT ITS
                            "EVIDENCE" TO MAXIMIZE EMBARRASSMENT FOR IRAN. HINCHCLIFFE NOTES THAT
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> WAS MENTIONED DURING FIRST FEW
                            HOURS AFTER COUP ATTEMPT WAS BROKEN BUT HAS NOT BEEN SPOKEN OF SINCE.
                            HOWEVER, BAGHDAD RADIO CONTINUED TO LINK CIA WITH IRANIANS AS
                            PERPETRATORS OF ATTEMPT.</p>
                        <p>4. ONLY PRESS COMMENT TO DATE APPEARED IN TODAY'S TIMES WHICH TREATS PLOT
                            AS SIMPLY ANOTHER INEVITABLE CONSPIRACY AGAINST SMALL GROUP WHO HOLD
                            POWER IN BAGHDAD. MORE SUCH PLOTS WILL COME SINCE THIS IS ONLY WAY TO
                            CHANGE REGIME WHICH IS "INCOMPETENT AND BLOODTHIRSTY.” TALLY OF
                            EXECUTIONS OF PAST TWO DAYS IS HIGH EVEN BY IRAQI STANDARDS. "SO THE
                            REVOLUTION EATS ITS CHILDREN, AND A GREAT MANY OTHER UNFORTUNATES AS
                            WELL.” ACCUSATIONS AND ACTION AGAINST IRAN ARE NEW ELEMENT IN THIS
                            LATEST TERROR, PAPER SAYS. REAL TRUTH IS DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER: "ALL THAT
                            IS CERTAIN IS THAT ONCE AGAIN THE MEN IN BAGHDAD HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES
                            TO BE MEN OF BLOOD.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. I QUERIED DEPUTY FONMIN KHALATBARI THIS MORNING ABOUT IRAQ SITUATION
                            AND IRAQ-IRAN RELATIONS. HE REPLIED SITUATION "CONFUSED" AND IT NOT
                            CLEAR WHETHER THERE IS ONE OR MORE GROUPS IN IRAQ INVOLVED IN REPORTED
                            COUP.</p>
                        <p>2. HE SAID IRAQIS HAD NOT OBSERVED DIPLOMATIC NORMS IN TREATMENT OF
                            IRANIAN DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL IN BAGHDAD IN THAT THEY FIRST THREW
                            MILITARY CORDON AROUND EMBASSY AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAD LOCKED IRANIAN
                            AMBASSADOR AND OTHER IRANIANS IN SMALL ROOM AT BAGHDAD AIRPORT HOLDING
                            THEM THERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE DEPARTURE. FURTHERMORE WHEN IRANIAN
                            CHARGE HAD RETURNED TO EMBASSY FOLLOWING HIS AMBASSADOR'S FORCED
                            DEPARTURE HIS CAR HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GUN POINT OUTSIDE-EMBASSY AND
                            THOROUGHLY SEARCHED, ETC.</p>
                        <p>3. KHALABARI SAID WORD OF THIS TREATMENT STIRRED UP CONSIDERABLE ANGER
                            AMONG DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN IRAN <pb n="2" xml:id="d266-02" facs="d266-02"/>AND TEHRAN AIRPORT OFFICIALS HAD WANTED TO LOCK
                            IRAQI AMBASSADOR IN SMALL ROOM GIVING HIM SIMILAR TREATMENT TO THAT OF
                            IRANIAN AMBASSADOR IN BAGHDAD. THIS FONMIN HAD FIRMLY RESISTED AND HAD
                            INSISTED THAT IRAQ AMBASSADOR AND FOUR MEMBERS OF EMBASSY WHO WERE ASKED
                            TO LEAVE BE GIVEN FACILITIES OF VIP ROOM AND TREATED AS FRIENDLY
                            DIPLOMATS. (EXTENSIVE FILMED COVERAGE OF DEPARTURE EXPELLED IRAQI
                            DIPLOMATS ON IRANIAN TV SHOWED VIP WAITING ROOM ATMOSPHERE AND EXCHANGES
                            BETWEEN DIPLOMATS, OFFICIALS AND GUESTS WAS RELAXED, FRIENDLY AND GOOD
                            HUMORED. CONTRARY TO IRAQI CHARGES OF MISTREATMENT IMPRESSION GIVEN BY
                            COVERAGE WAS ONE OF COURTESY AND WARM FAREWELLS ON BOTH SIDES, INCLUDING
                            EMBRACE BETWEEN IRAQI AMBASSADOR AND PRESIDING IRANIAN FONMIN
                            OFFICIALS.) HE ADDED THAT WHEREAS IRAQIS HAD PNG'D IRAN AMBASSADOR AND
                            FOUR COLLEAGUES, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAD ONLY ASKED
                            EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF IRAQI DIPLOMATS TO LEAVE IRAN WITHOUT PNG.</p>
                        <p>4. KHALATBARI SAID THAT WHILE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WANTED
                            TO REACT IN MODERATE AND BALANCED WAY TO IRAQ, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> FACED VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO STRIKE PROPER BALANCE
                            FOR TWO REASONS: IF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DID NOTHING (A)
                            IRAQIS MIGHT INTERPRET THIS AS WEAKNESS AND PROCEED TO EVEN GREATER
                            PROVOCATION: (B) IRANIAN PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE VERY CRITICAL OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> FOR NOT RETALIATING IN KIND.
                            NONETHELESS IRAN WOULD TRY TO STRIKE PROPER BALANCE AND FONMIN FAVORED
                            MODERATION. SPEAKING PERSONALLY I SAID MODERATION WOULD SEEM TO SERVE
                            IRAN'S INTEREST BECAUSE WHEN CONTRASTED WITH IRAQ EXTREMES IT WOULD
                            BENEFIT IRAN'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. KHALATBARI AGREED BUT SAID IT WAS
                            ALL VERY DIFFICULT.</p>
                        <p>5. I ALSO ASKED WHETHER THERE WERE ANY IRAQI MIITARY MOVEMENTS WHICH GAVE
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> CONCERN. HE REPLIED THAT WHILE
                            HE UNDERSTOOD THERE HAD BEEN SOME DEPLOYMENTS, THERE HAD BEEN NONE OF
                            WHICH HE HAD HEARD THAT WERE CAUSE FOR CONCERN AND THIS WAS
                            UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE WITH KURDS AND POTENTIALLY DISSIDENT ELEMENTS
                            WITHIN IRAQ, IRAQI GOVT PROBABLY HAD ITS HANDS FULL.</p>
                        <p>6. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING PRESENT BAGHDAD REIGN OF TERROR AND BLOODBATH
                            PROBABLY DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE EXISTING OPPOSITION LEADERS AND TO
                            INTIMIDATE ANYONE WHO OPPOSED <pb n="3" xml:id="d266-03" facs="d266-03"/>EXISTING REGIME. WHETHER IN FACT IT WOULD INTIMIDATE MAJORITY OF
                            IRAQIS WHO HE SAID OPPOSED PRESENT REGIME OR WHETHER THEY WOULD FEAR
                            THAT THEY MIGHT BE NEXT ON LIST AND WOULD REACT AGAINST PRESENT REGIME,
                            ONLY TIME COULD TELL.</p>

                        <p>1. IDRISS BARZANI, SON OF KURDISH REBEL LEADER MULLAH MUSTAFA <pb n="2" xml:id="d267-02" facs="d267-02"/>BARZANI, ARRIVED IN TEHRAN, IRAN,
                            ON 4 MARCH IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE IRANIAN NATIONAL SECURITY
                            AND INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (SAVAK) THAT HE COME FOR DISCUSSIONS
                            CONCERNING THE FUTURE OF THE KURDISH REVOLUTION. ON 4 AND 5 MARCH
                            BARZANI, SAMI SANJARI, AND ANIR QASIMI MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
                            GOVERMENT OF ISRAEL. THE ISRAELIS PUSHED HARD FOR RESUMPTION OF
                            HOSTILITIES IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND PROMISED THE KURDS THAT THEY WOULD
                            SUPPLY ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS AND LIGHT ARTILLERY (SIC). IDRISS BARZANI
                            REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF ARMORED CARS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL
                            CARRIERS. THE ISRAELIS ALSO AGREED TO SUPPLY THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. IN
                            SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS, THE ISRAELIS SAID THAT MULLAH MUSTAFA BARZANI
                            SHOULD MAKE AN EFFORT TO CAPTURE AT LEAST TWO IRAQI TANKS. USING THIS
                            CAPTURE AS COVER, THE ISRAELIS PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD SUPPLY, VIA
                            IRAN, ADDITIONAL TANKS WITH CREWS. IDRISS BARZANI SAID THAT HE PREFERRED
                            TO HAVE ALL KURDISH CREWS FOR ANY TANKS AND REQUESTED THAT KURDS BE
                            TRAINED IN THE OPERATION OF TANKS. THE ISRAELIS READILY CONSENTED TO
                            THIS REQUEST.</p>
                        <p>2. ON 6 MARCH BARZANI MET WITH GENERAL NEMATOLLAH NASSERI, CHIEF OF
                            SAVAK. NASSERI DISCUSSED IRANIAN PLANS FOR FURTHER AID TO <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">MULLAH MUSTAFA</persName> BARZANI AND IRANIAN
                            CONCERN OVER BARZANI‘S NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IRAQI REGIME. NASSERI SAID
                            THAT IRAN WAS FULLY BEHIND THE ISRAELI PLAN TO RENEW THE FIGHTING IN
                            NORTHERN IRAQ, AND IDRISS SHOULD CAREFULLY NOTE WHAT THE ISRAELIS WERE
                            SUGGESTING. IDRISS BARZANI WAS TO MEET WITH <pb n="3" xml:id="d267-03" facs="d267-03"/>NASSERI AGAIN ON 7 MARCH TO DISCUSS FURTHER THE
                            ISRAELI PROPOSALS.</p>
                        <p>3. DURING THE PAST MONTH IRANIAN AND ISRAELI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO
                            BARZANI HAS BEEN 1,200,000 IRAQI DINARS (U.S. DOLLARS 3,360,000).</p>

                        <p>1. You may draw from following in your talk with Alam and during any
                            further discussions with any ranking officials you may have concerning
                            events in Iraq and the possibility of Soviet collusion there.</p>
                        <p>2. While agreeing that just announced Iraqi/Kurdish settlement looks more
                            binding than anything developed heretofore, we question whether it will
                            hold for any substantial length of time. Careful reading of Fifteen
                            Point Settlement Declaration appears leave unanswered critical question
                            of what degree of autonomy Kurdish province will in fact enjoy. As this
                            is doubtless key element of any lasting agreement believe implementation
                            will uncover serious if not fatal flaws. Even should active hostilities
                            not be resumed in these circumstances <pb n="2" xml:id="d268-02" facs="d268-02"/>believe possibility will be latent cause for Baghdad
                            concern for some time to come. Doubt therefore that Iraqi government
                            will feel free for long to make significant shift in its attention and
                            resources away from Kurds to Iran and Persian Gulf area. Furthermore,
                            any easement on this score might well see troops being redeployed in
                            Jordan and Syria rather than southern Iraq.</p>
                        <p>3. We agree Soviets have been encouraging Iraqi/Kurdish settlement but it
                            less clear what effect this actually had in bringing about current
                            settlement. Soviet attitude toward Kurds has fluctuated and generally
                            been subordinated to other Soviet policy considerations in the area. No
                            doubt their important investment in the Baghdad Government was seen as
                            being vitiated somewhat by internal strife and that an Iraqi/Kurdish
                            settlement was clearly to be preferred.</p>
                        <p>4. While it is likely Soviets are interested in developing a position of
                            influence among the Kurds we doubt this is an asset <pb n="3" xml:id="d268-03" facs="d268-03"/>they would wish to employ in the
                            immediate future. We particularly skeptical that they would attempt to
                            promote a "Kurdish corridor" at this time. To do so would obviously
                            raise grave questions among Soviet Arab friends as to what their true
                            intentions were since they would be witnessing the detachment of an
                            important province from an Arab state. Further it seems unlikely that
                            the Soviets would want to risk damaging their carefully nurtured
                            relations with Iran and Turkey by embarking on a plan such as foreseen
                            para 4(e) reftel which would presumably elicit strong reaction from both
                            those countries.</p>
                        <p>5. We of course agree with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> general
                            premise that this is an important development which merits most careful
                            and continuing attention. We appreciate concern this gives <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and welcome any further views it may

                        <p>1. During Secretary's discussion on Middle East with Israeli FonMin
                            DirGen Rafael April 10, latter asserted Soviets had played decisive role
                            in Iraq-Kurdish agreement. According Rafael, Iraqis were extremely
                            reluctant to settle Kurdish problem but Soviets insisted, indicating
                            they wanted peace in proximity df <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s borders. Iraqi negotiators had literally asked Kurds to
                            state their terms for agreement and then signed without further
                            discussion.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d269-02" facs="d269-02"/>
                        <p>2. Rafael volunteered the same comments on subject during conversation
                            April 10 with DepAsst Sec Swank (septel), offering this alleged Soviet
                            action with Iraq as illustration of powerful influence Rafael thinks
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could bring to bear in Cairo
                            if so disposed. (Latter point also made by inference in conversation
                            with Secretary.) Rafael added Israeli info, which he called totally
                            reliable, indicates Soviets put into balance (A) further Soviet arms
                            assistance to Iraq, (B) Soviet oil cooperation with Iraq, and (C)
                            probably also promises of Soviet support for bigger Iraqi role in
                            Persian Gulf affairs.</p>
                        <p>3. Rafael expanded his thesis in Swank conversation to suggest that
                            Moscow has traditionally alternated its Middle East attention between
                            penetration into Red Sea as gateway to East Africa and into Persian Gulf
                            as avenue to South Asia, and when stymied in one direction, shifts back
                            to other. Rafael asserted Soviets in 1950s had not calculated potential
                            setbacks to their efforts in <pb n="3" xml:id="d269-03" facs="d269-03"/>Egypt or enormous investments required. Said that Israel as early as
                            1966 anticipated Soviet shift of interest to Gulf; he said so himself to
                            Secretary Rusk and urged US fill British vacuum, but was told US would
                            not take on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> commitments east of Suez.
                            Rafael predicted to Swank that Soviet pressures which produced
                            Iraqi-Kurdish agreement were only first manifestation of new Soviet
                            drive for influence in Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>4. COMMENT: We realize Israelis have good sources on Kurdish matters but
                            believe Rafael has exaggerated Soviet role in recent Iraqi-Kurdish
                            agreement. Addressees' views would be welcome.</p>

                        <p>During an impromptu social encounter June 28, Mike Gardiner, Deputy Chief
                            Representative of the Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) in Baghdad (protect), told the reporting officer in
                            "strictest confidence" that <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> for the
                            first time in five years had faint hopes of resolving several of its
                            most difficult outstanding problems with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. The primary reason for this new optimism is the
                            desperate financial plight of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>According to Gardiner, the Soviet Union is putting heavy pressure on the
                            GOI to pay the overdue installments on past Soviet loans for the
                            construction of various industrial projects. (Gardiner mentioned a
                            figure of 35 million pounds sterling.) The government does not have the
                            necessary cash and the Soviet Union allegedly has threatened to withdraw
                            its support of some current projects, including development of the
                            Mishraq sulfur deposits (a Polish project) and construction of the new
                            $62.5 million Basra refinery (a Czech project). Alternatively, it would
                            be willing to negotiate a debt moratorium if the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would take into the government several persons it would
                            designate.</p>
                        <p>The Baathi rulers in Baghdad fear acceptance of such conditions would
                            irrevocably compromise their hegemony in Iraq and lead to formation of a
                            government totally subservient to Soviet will. They see this development
                            as the logical next step after their surrender to Soviet pressure for an
                            unwelcome settlement with the Kurds.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d270-02" facs="d270-02"/>
                        <p> Gardiner believes the Soviet objective is to create a secure base in
                            Iraq for penetration into the Gulf and eventual subversive moves against
                            Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. To avoid this development, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> believes the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may now be willing to settle outstanding problems in
                            exchange for a "generous" cash consideration. Gardiner asked that this
                            subject be held very closely so as not to jeopardize the sensitive
                            negotiations now taking place.</p>
                        <p>On another subject, Gardiner stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had recently sentenced a number of Iraqis for various
                            alleged subversive activities. He mentioned specifically former Defense
                            Minister 'Abd al <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Aziz al</persName>
                            'Uqayly, sentenced to death, and his brother Ghanim al 'Uqayly,
                            sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for his association with Lutfi
                            'Ubaydi and former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Anderson in
                            connection with negotiations over the Mishraq sulfur scheme.</p>
                        <p>Comment: The austerity theme highlighting recent Iraqi budgetary
                            statements and static Iraqi oil revenues foreseen at <gloss target="#t_ID1">ID</gloss> 170 million are probably not unrelated to
                            Gardiner's comments. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> payment of at
                            least $150 million in settlement of the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> royalty expensing formula of 1964/65, which Iraq never
                            has accepted, and subsequent higher annual payments to Iraq would indeed
                            help the Iraqi revenue picture. One must view Gardiner's opinions with
                            some caution, however, as they no doubt reflect the hopeful views of his
                            superior, C. (Cocky) E. Hahn, chief <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            representative in Iraq, Hahn is well known as a very persistent
                            negotiator and his relations with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>/London headquarters dictate a hopeful tone in his reports
                            to London. V-P Henry Moses and Robert Barnes of Mobil/New York noted
                            this aspect of Hahn's operations in Iraq during their recent passage
                            (June 12-16) through Beirut, On the other hand, Moses also noted that
                            recent changes in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s top-level
                            management could mean a more aggressive and flexible approach to
                            resolution of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s long-standing
                            problems in Iraq. Another point concerning the Iraqi financial picture
                            was recently brought to our attention by the Beirut-based representative
                            of Morgan Guaranty bank, He was very puzzled by the $60 million drop in
                            Iraqi foreign exchange and gold holdings in the period December
                            1969-January 1970, as indicated in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            financial statistics. We could not recall any sudden payment that would
                            have accounted for a drop of this magnitude and a check of
                            Iraqi-watchers in Beirut produced no concrete information on the reason
                            for the drop. <pb n="3" xml:id="d270-03" facs="d270-03"/>Our Iraqi
                            contacts also have had little information of the results of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> action taken against the 'Uqayly
                            brothers; to our knowledge, this is the first reliable information we
                            have had concerning their fate, Ghanim's Beirut-based partner, Tariq
                            Shafiq, is currently in the United States; we suspect Aramco,

                        <p rend="center">IRAQ-PERSIAN GULF: IRAQ LOOKS AT THE GULF</p>
                        <p>The planned withdrawal of the British from the Persian Gulf region by the
                            end of 1971 provides Iraq with an opportunity to expand its present role
                            in Gulf politics. This expanded role, however, may be restricted by
                            Iraqi preoccupation with the Israeli problem. The recent easing of
                            tensions between Iraq and its Kurdish minority has, on the other hand,
                            enabled the government to turn its attention to the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Increased activities noted. Iraq has greatly increased its activities in
                            the Gulf during the past two years, including numerous Tikriti visited
                            Kuwait and the nine Gulf amirates and several Gulf exchanges of official
                            visits. In April 1969 Iraqi Vice President HARDAN leaders visited Iraq
                            in that year. <persName>Tikriti</persName> visited Kuwait again in 1970.
                            Both the Crown Prince and the Ruler of Bahrain have made several visits
                            to Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>Iraq has also endeavored to establish branches of Iraqi banks, insurance
                            companies and trade offices, and to obtain airline landing rights in
                            various Gulf states. In Bahrain, a new Iraqi trade office, a branch of
                            the Iraqi Rafidain Bank, and an office of the Iraqi Insurance Company
                            have all been opened in the past year.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d271-02" facs="d271-02"/>
                        <p>Of greater potential significance, the Iraqi government is attempting to
                            strengthen its ties with radical elements in the Arab Gulf states, and
                            possibly in Iran as well. For example, the radical Ba'thist party
                            faction that dominates the Iraqi government has set up a commercial
                            center in Kuwait that appears to be the control center for Iraqi
                            subversion in the Gulf. In Kuwait, the Iraqi Embassy has pressured young
                            Iraqi residents to return to Iraq for training in subversive activities,
                            and Iraqi agents have been recruiting Bahrainis and Omanis for similar
                            training in Iraq. Iraq has also attempted, without notable success, to
                            encourage subversive elements in Iran's Arab-speaking province of
                            Khuzistan through the formation of the Arabistan Liberation

                        <p>Iraq - Iran: Mutual competition and antipathy. Iraq views Iran as the
                            principal source of competition for leadership in the Gulf in the wake
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> withdrawal, and the major
                            opponent to the spread of Iraqi radicalism in the Gulf. Of particular
                            concern to Iraq are Iran's intentions to establish hegemony in the Gulf
                            after the British withdrawal. Iranian predominance would be opposed by
                            Iraq not only on political and ideological grounds—Iranian conservatism
                            vs. Iraqi radicalism—but also on nationalistic grounds—Arabism vs.
                            Iranianism. Iranian nationalism is in conflict with the Arab concept of
                            the "Arab nature of the Gulf,” a recurring theme in Iraqi propaganda.
                            Iraq has attempted to exploit the fears of the smaller Arab Gulf states
                            about Iranian intentions in the Gulf. For instance, Iraq has made an
                            issue <pb n="3" xml:id="d271-03" facs="d271-03"/>of the disputed
                            sovereignty over the Tunbs and Abu Musa, small islands in the Gulf that
                            are claimed by Iran and by two Gulf shaykhdoms, and has stated publicly
                            that it would oppose the transfer of these islands to Iran. It has also
                            privately attempted to persuade the two Arab shaykhs involved not to
                            give up their claims.</p>
                        <p>Iran's friendly relations with Israel and the transit of Iranian oil
                            through the Israeli pipeline are a further source of Iraqi hostility to
                            Iran. A key element in Iraqi strategy in influencing the Gulf Arab
                            rulers is a campaign of intimidation against Arab leaders who
                            collaborate with a friend of Israel.</p>
                        <p>Iraq-Saudi Arabia: The major Arab competition. Iraq's attempt to play a
                            major role in the Gulf also places it in competition with Saudi Arabia.
                            Like the Shah, the conservative Saudi regime is strongly opposed to the
                            spread of Arab radicalism in the lower Gulf. Even though, as an Arab
                            state, it is suspicious of Iranian intentions in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia
                            is willing to cooperate with Iran to keep radicalism out of the Gulf.
                            If, however, the issue developed into one of Arabism vs. Iranian
                            hegemony, it would be difficult for the Arab shaykhdoms and for Saudi
                            Arabia to refrain from a forthright stance against Iranian
                            "imperialism.”</p>
                        <p>Iraq-Kuwait: Target of special attention. When the Ba'thists came to
                            power in 1963 Iraq agreed to drop its claim to Kuwait and to demarcate
                            the Iraq-Kuwait border. Iraq, however, has not carried through on border
                            demarcation, and it has continued to use the threat of pressing <pb n="4" xml:id="d271-04" facs="d271-04"/>its claim to intimidate the
                            Kuwaiti regime. In May 1970 Iraq cautioned Kuwait against becoming too
                            cooperative with Iran or concerting with Iran and Saudi Arabia on the
                            issue of the Tunbs and Abu Musa. Duly intimidated, the Kuwait government
                            ordered two Kuwaiti newspapers to publish a series of articles
                            derogatory to Iran and Saudi Arabia, thereby souring Kuwaiti relations
                            with the two most powerful states in the area. Despite increased
                            pressure, however, it remains unlikely that Iraq would attempt to back
                            up its efforts with force as this would prompt Kuwait to appeal for help
                            from the conservative Arab regimes, the other Arab Gulf leaders.</p>
                        <p>Caution: The Iraqi watchword. Iraq will probably move carefully in
                            developing its policy toward the Gulf States. On the one hand, it will
                            probably continue to woo the present traditional leaders of the states
                            through diplomatic and economic means. On the other hand, it will
                            continue to use political intimidation to influence the rulers if the
                            Carrot does not work. At the same time it can be expected to important,
                            this pro-Iraqi majority among the Ba'thists is likely to give
                            Iraqi-oriented elements a significant role in Bahraini politics after
                            the British withdraw from the Gulf.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d271-05" facs="d271-05"/>
                        <p>If the new British Government ultimately decides to delay the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s departure from the Gulf, the Iraqis can
                            be expected to launch a strong anti-British, anti-imperialist campaign
                            to encourage the ruling shaykhs to pressure the British to leave as
                            rapidly as possible. The US, as the alleged leader of "western
                            imperialism,” will also be a major target of this "anti" campaign. In
                            addition, Iraq could step up its subversive activities aimed primarily
                            at the British and pro-British Arab governments. In the meantime, given
                            the uncertainties about British intentions, Iraq will probably continue
                            to pursue a cautious "wait and see" policy. Once the British depart,
                            however, Iraqi activity can be expected to accelerate considerably,
                            reflecting Iraqi confidence that it can exert a major influence on
                            future Gulf politics.</p>

                        <p>1. What little information we have re current Iraqi visit to Moscow (see
                            para 4 reftel) indicates trip's original purpose was Iraqi desire to
                            discuss Soviet loans to Iraq involving, among other things, Iraqi effort
                            to revise or extend installment payments on loans which reportedly total
                            $60 million. In this connection we have heard reports of Iraqi financial
                            difficulties obliging them at one stage to approach Libyans for
                            assistance. Libyans allegedly turned them down.</p>
                        <p>2. We also had earlier unconfirmed reports of Iraqi intention to seek
                            more arms including perhaps aircraft.</p>
                        <p>3. In any event, we believe it quite likely Soviets <pb n="2" xml:id="d272-02" facs="d272-02"/>will seize opportunity to pressure
                            Iraqis to change their current anti-NASSER stand. Supporting this view
                            was Soviet press attack in Pravda on Iraq which appeared on August 1
                            expressing Soviet displeasure over current opposition to NASSER's
                            acceptance of US peace initiative. In addition during lackluster August
                            5 luncheon in honor of Iraqi Delegation, Mazurov, First Vice-Chairman of
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Council of Ministers made
                            pointed statement of Soviet support for "attainment of just political
                            settlement of M.E. conflict.” Finally, unconfirmed Beirut report says
                            that Iraq has recently received request from Soviets for repayment of
                            Iraqi debts and threatening to suspend aid and shipment of spare
                            parts.</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: We doubt Soviets will have much luck with unpredictable and
                            uncontrollable Iraqis who appear to have painted themselves into
                            isolated anti-NASSER corner. <pb n="3" xml:id="d272-03" facs="d272-03"/>Playing important role in Iraqi thinking is long standing Ba'athi
                            antipathy to NASSER compounded by traditional Mesopotamian suspicion of

                            THE PALESTINE PROBLEM HAS BECOME ANOTHER BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE
                            BPI AND THE KURDS. INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE PEACE PROPOSALS, AS THE
                            IRAQI GOVERNMENT HAD DIRECTED, AL-TAAKHI, THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE BARZANI
                            KURDS,SUPPORTED THAT COURSE OF ACTION.</p>
                        <p>3. THE BARZANIS, ANTICIPATING A SHOWDOWN WITH THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT, ARE
                            STRENGTHENING THEIR FORCES AND LINING UP POTENTIAL ALLIES. THEY ARE
                            ATTEMPTING TO FACTIONALIZE THE JALAL AL-TALABANI FORCES BY ATTRACTING
                            THOSE WHO ACCEPT <persName>BARZANI</persName>'S LEADERSHIP, AND
                            ATTACKING THOSE WHO WAIVER. THEY HAVE SENT EMISSARIES TO LONDON TO
                            CONVINCE IBRAHIM AHMAD, TALABANI'S COLLEAGUE, TO JOIN THEIR RANKS. THEY
                            HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNIST

                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> OF IRAQI DELEGATION HEADED BY
                            SADDAM <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">HUSSEIN TIKRITI</persName>, INDICATES
                            SOVIETS FAILED TO PERSUADE IRAQIS TO MODIFY THEIR TOUGH ANTI-NASSER
                            STAND, AND THAT TWO SIDES CONTINUE TO DISAGREE OVER HOW TO DEAL WITH ME
                            SITUATION. COMMUNIQUE CONTAINS NO MENTION OF AGREEMENT ON ADDITIONAL
                            SOVIET AID TO IRAQ, NOTING ONLY THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE AGREED TO CONTINUE
                            TALKS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT IN RESPONSE TO IRAQI REFUSAL TO ADOPT MORE
                            MODERATE LINE ON ME, SOVIETS MAY HAVE TAKEN TOUGH BARGAINING STANCE ON
                            AID QUESTION AND MAY EVEN HAVE TURNED DOWN IRAQI REQUESTS FOR <pb n="2" xml:id="d274-02" facs="d274-02"/>EXTENSION OF LOAN PAYMENTS.</p>
                        <p>2. DEPTH OF DISAGREEMENT IS MOST STRIKING IN TREATMENT OF ME, ON WHICH
                            COMMUNIQUE SAYS ONLY THAT SIDES "EXCHANGED VIEWS ON SITUATION.” THIS IS
                            STANDARD SOVIET COMMUNIQUE LANGUAGE FOR LACK OF ANY AGREEMENT. TOTAL
                            ABSENCE OF COMMENT ON ME SITUATION STRIKES US AS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING.
                            EVEN ASSUMING FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT OVER SITUATION, TWO SIDES MIGHT
                            HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO COME UP WITH SOME STANDARD LANGUAGE CONDEMING
                            ISRAELI AGRESSION. EXTENT OF DIFFERENCES IS ALSO SHOWN BY FACT SOVIETS
                            CHOSE TO OMIT ANY REFERENCE TO "SUPPORT FOR ARAB STATES AND PEOPLES.”
                            ONLY RELATED AREA ON WHICH SOME AGREEMENT WAS POSSIBLE IS PERSIAN GULF,
                            WHICH RATES PARAGRAPH EMPHASIZING NECESSITY OF LIQUIDATING IMPERIALIST
                            PRESENCE IN REGION.</p>
                        <p>3. CHARACTERIZATION OF ATMOSPHERE OF "OPENNESS AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING"
                            IS DEFINITELY ON COOL SIDE AND COVERS WIDELY DIFFERING VIEWPOINTS. OTHER
                            NOTICEABLY RESTRAINED STATEMENTS INCLUDE EXPRESSION OF "SATISFACTION"
                            WITH STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES AND CHARACTERIZATION OF
                            MEETINGS AS "USEFUL.” ALTHOUGH TIKRITI HAD OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED MEETING
                            WITH <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">KOSYGIN</persName> ON AUGUST 11,
                            COMMUNIQUE POINTEDLY FAILS TO MENTION THIS, IN LISTING MAZUROV AND
                            PONOMAREV AS HAVING LED SOVIET SIDE.</p>
                        <p>4. WHILE WE WOULD EXPECT IRAQIS TO HAVE SOUGHT ADDITIONAL AID FROM
                            SOVIETS, COMMUNIQUE GIVES NO HINT THAT SOVIETS MADE ANY NEW COMMITMENT.
                            IN PHRASING THAT APPEARS INTENDED TO REFER MAINLY TO PAST ASSISTANCE,
                            IRAQI SIDE EXPRESSES GRATITUDE FOR SOVIET ASSISTANCE IN "DEVELOPING
                            ECONOMY, TRAINING NATIONAL CADRES AND STRENGTHENING DEFENSE CAPACITY" OF
                            IRAQ. HOWEVER, COMMUNIQUE CONTAINS NO CLEAR INDICATION THAT SOVIETS WILL
                            CONTINUE SUPPLY AID, SAYING ONLY THAT SIDES AGREED TO CONTINUE TALKS "TO
                            CONCLUDE AGREEMENTS ON NUMBER OF CONCRETE MATTERS.”</p>
                        <p>5. PERHAPS TO MAKE UP FOR LACK OF ANY DISCUSSION OF ME SITUATION,
                            PORTIONS OF COMMUNIQUE DEALING WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ISSUES CONTAINS
                            UNUSUALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF WINDOW DRESSING. TREATMENT OF A NUMBER OF
                            ISSUES—DENUNCIATION OF US AGRESSION IN SEA, ABOLITION OF COLONIALISM,

                        <p>1. THE SOVIETS BEGAN CRITICIZING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ ABOUT JANUARY
                            1970, TALKING POINTEDLY ABOUT THE "BA'TH GOVERNMENT.” IN MARCH THE
                            CHARGE', IN EXPLAINING SOVIET CONCERN WITH INTERNAL IRAQI DEVELOPMENTS,
                            SAID THAT, AFTER ALL, THE SOVIET KURDS CONSIDER MULLAH MUSTAFA BARZANI
                            TO BE THE "KING OF THE KURDS.” BY JUNE THE CHARGE' WAS USING THE TERM
                            "NATIONAL SOCIALISM" TO CHARACTERIZE THE BA'TH REGIME. IN JULY THE
                            SOVIET AMBASSADOR SAID THAT DESPITE THE MILITARY AID GIVEN TO IRAQ SINCE
                            1963, IRAQ HAS NOT EVEN STARTED PAYING INTEREST ON THE WEAPONS THEY HAVE
                            RECEIVED. ACCORDING TO THE SOVIET <pb n="2" xml:id="d275-02" facs="d275-02"/>AMBASSADOR, THE SOVIETS WOULD BE WILLING TO SETTLE
                            FOR EVEN A TOKEN OF IRAQI SINCERITY, SUCH AS A CONCESSION ON THE IDEA OF
                            A NATIONAL FRONT.</p>
                        <p>2. THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOVIET DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT
                            OF IRAQ. THE MILITARY ATTACHE SAID THE SOVIETS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IN
                            SOUTHERN IRAQ A REFINERY TO SERVE AS A SOVIET REFUELING BASE (SIC).
                            ACCORDING TO THE SOVIET ATTACHE, BASRA IS INADEQUATE FOR SUCH A PURPOSE.
                            (SOURCE COMMENT: THE SUB-SOURCE SAID HE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THINGS

                            IN COMMUNICATIONS HAS MADE THE SOVIETS NERVOUS, AND THE BA'TH REGIME
                            OBVIOUSLY IS IN BETTER CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY THAN EVER BEFORE. MORE

                        <p>1. MUHAMMAD JA'FAR AL-NUMAYRI, A SHI'A MUSLIM FROM BASRAH, IRAQ, WHO
                            CLAIMS HE IS A FORMER IRAQI MINISTER, IS INVOLVED IN AN ANTI-COMMUNIST
                            COUP PLOT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ, WHICH IS LED BY THE SHI'A
                            MUSLIMS, AND IS TO BE ATTEMPTED ABOUT MID-SEPTEMBER. AL-NUMAYRI HAS BEEN
                            WORKING IN ABU DHABI AND DUBAI. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: AL-NUMAYRI IS
                            PROBABLY IDENTICAL WITH ONE MUHAMMAD AL-NUMAYRI WHO WAS REPORTED <pb n="2" xml:id="d276-02" facs="d276-02"/>BY FBIS ON 22 JANUARY 1970 AS
                            HAVING RECEIVED A DEATH SENTENCE IN ABSENTIA BECAUSE OF HIS INVOLVEMENT
                            IN THE 22 JANUARY 1970 ABORTIVE COUP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ. WE
                            HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION ON ALNUMAYRI AND ARE NOT ABLE TO VERIFY THAT
                            HE IS A FORMER MINISTER.)</p>
                        <p>2. ACCORDING TO AL-NUMAYRI, THE SHI'A IS FED UP WITH THE BA'TH REGIME'S
                            DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM. AL-NUMAYRI SAID HE HAS SUPPORT FROM SHAYKH
                            ZAYID OF ABU DHABI; TARIQ BIN TAYMUR OF OMAN; IMAM MUSA AL-SADR, SHI'A
                            LEADER OF LEBANON; AND THE AGHA KHAN, LEADER OF THE SHI'A ISMA'ILIS.
                            AL-NUMAYRI IS WORKING WITH THE "ISMA'ILI OFFICE" IN BEIRUT. IT IS
                            PLANNED TO ATTEMPT THE COUP IN MID-SEPTEMBER BECAUSE THE IRAQI REGIME IS
                            SHAKEN BY INTERNAL DISPUTES, AND THE REGIME WOULD NOT KNOW WHO IS
                            STRIKING AT THIS TIME, I.E., THE UAR, IRAN, KUWAIT, OR SAUDI ARABIA.</p>
                        <p>3. AL-NUMAYRI, WHO WAS IN POSSESSION OF IRAQI AND ABU DHABI PASSPORTS AND
                            A BUSINESS CARD FROM BAGHDAD, SAID THAT INCLUDED IN THE PLOTTING GROUP
                            ARE FORMER MINISTERS, RELIGIOUS LEADERS, ENGINEERS, AND MILITARY
                            OFFICERS. ONE OF THOSE INVOLVED IS MAHMUD HASAN JUMA', A FORMER IRAQI
                            MINISTER, WHO IS AN ADVISOR TO SHAYKH ZAYID OF ABU DHABI AND JUMA' IS
                            COORDINATING ABU DHABI AND OMANI AID TO THE PLOTTERS. THESE GULF <pb n="3" xml:id="d276-03" facs="d276-03"/>LEADERS WANT TO COUNTER THE
                            ACTIVITIES OF THE IRAQI REGIME IN THE PERSIAN GULF. AL-NUMAYRI PLANS TO
                            STAY IN BEIRUT UNTIL 1 SEPTEMBER, THEN HE PLANS TO GO TO KUWAIT AND
                            ENTER IRAQ FROM KUWAIT.</p>
                        <p>4. AL-NUMAYRI DOES NOT PLAN TO INFORM SAUDI ARABIAN OR IRANIAN OFFICIALS,
                            BUT HE DOES PLAN TO INFORM THE KUWAITIS "SOON.” HE PLANS TO SEE THE
                            KUWAITI RULER IN BEIRUT. AL-NUMAYRI ALSO IS IN TOUCH WITH KURDISH LEADER
                            MULLAH MUSTAFAAL-BARZANI. AL-NUMAYRI SAID HE IS WILLING TO COOPERATE
                            WITH FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER 'ABD-AL-RAZZAQ NAYIF, BUT ONLY AT THE LAST
                            MINUTE, BECAUSE NAYIF IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY (SIC). (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT:
                            NAYIF HELPED THE BA'THIS GAIN POWER IN MID-1968 AND WAS EXILED TWO WEEKS
                            LATER BY THE BA'TH REGIME.)</p>
                        <p>5. AL-NUMAYRI CONTACTED A SYRIAN ARMS DEALER ON URGENT BASIS ON 28 AUGUST
                            BECAUSE OF AL-NUMAYRI'S NEED FOR EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THE ARMS DEALER HAD
                            IN A WAREHOUSE. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE SOURCE DID NOT SAY WHETHER HE
                            HAD PROVIDED THE EXPLOSIVES.)</p>

                        <p>The body of this airgram is an Embassy translation of a report on the
                            Jewish community in Iraq. The report was prepared by the Belgian Embassy
                            in Baghdad and passed to us by the Belgian Foreign Office. The Foreign
                            Office cautioned that the Belgian Embassy in Iraq should not be cited as
                            the source of this report.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary:</p>
                        <p>Slow improvement in the condition of Iraqi Jews with some reappearing in
                            the economic sector. University reppens its doors to Jewish students.
                            Authorities have renounced the use of certain harrassment. Emigration
                            remains forbidden but clandestine departures are made easier by the aid
                            of people living in Kurdish territory. The regime is probably tending
                            towards a normalization but is fearful of reactions of extremists. End
                            Summary</p>
                        <p>The last report which I sent to you on the question of the Israeli
                            community in Iraq was dated June 4, 1969. It was noted in that report
                            that the legal condition of the Jewish community had been improving.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, in the spring of last year, the authorities revoked
                            certain discriminatory ordinances put into effect by the Ministry of the
                            Interior in 1963. These ordinances covered the rights of Iraqi Jews to
                            travel, to engage in financial activities and to undertake contractual
                            relations. If since then, this legal adjustment has <pb n="2" xml:id="d277-02" facs="d277-02"/>remained largely a dead letter, the
                            real lot of Iraqis of the Jewish confession has none the less in a
                            general fashion slowly improved. In the business world, for example,
                            their ostracism is no longer complete. Certain Jews are discreetly
                            reappearing in business firms which employ them. They are also
                            reappearing at the head of firms still owned by Jews. In these latter
                            cases, the Jews operate for the most part behind Arab frontmen. The
                            Embassies are noticing that it is no longer exceptional that their
                            commercial services are dealing with Jews employed by Iraqi firms.</p>
                        <p>Higher education is no longer inaccessible to them. At the beginning of
                            the new academic year, the university alone received 20 Jewish students.
                            In principle, all the faculties are open to them with the exception
                            perhaps of the medical faculty where they are encountering difficulties
                            in enrolling. It seems that the authorities believe there is too large a
                            proportion of Jewish doctors in the medical corps of Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Vexations, which darkened their existence, are tending to disappear. The
                            use of the telephone has been, in principal, returned to them. Their
                            movements within the country are coming under less control. Police
                            surveillance has been relaxed and the general atmosphere tends towards a
                            detente.</p>
                        <p>On one point, however, the regime remains intractable: emigration. But in
                            this field as well, unexpected horizons recently have opened. If legal
                            departure from the country remains forbidden, clandestine movement has
                            become more practicable than at any time since the Baathists took power.
                            As a matter of fact, the pacification of the Kurds has opened in the
                            North of the country a zone where the frontier is wide open. This zone
                            has been quickly exploited. It seems that as soon as hostilities between
                            the Montagnards (Kurds) and the Government in Baghdad ended,
                            philanthropic associations approached <persName>Barzani</persName> and
                            set up in Kurdistan an organization for passing Jews across the Iranian
                            frontier.</p>
                        <p>To this time, some 250 Jews have used this organization to leave Iraq.
                            Met and cared for at the Iranian frontier by a charitable organization
                            based in Tehran, they have been for the most part sent on to Canada or
                            Denmark where special arrangements for their immigration have been made
                            available to them.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of September, however, about 100 Jews, who too
                            confidently departed more or less grouped together, attracted the
                            attention of the police. They were arrested at Irbil; all their
                            possessions were confiscated; <pb n="3" xml:id="d277-03" facs="d277-03"/>and they were beaten and thrown into jail. They, were, however,
                            quickly released and do not seem to have been bothered further by the
                            police.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the era of overt harrassment is finished and that we are
                            moving towards a new equilibrium permitting the two communities to live
                            together. Moreover, as a matter of principle, if it were not for the
                            political conditions which prevail, the Baathists could not be hostile
                            to the Jewish community. The Baath ideology postulates tolerance in
                            questions of religion and race, and in Iraq itself its policies are
                            aimed at rallying the support of the minorities.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the regime has learned to measure the force of world opinion
                            and knows that this force is sensitized to the lot of the Jews remaining
                            in Arab lands. Perhaps the Government has given thought to offering an
                            example in Iraq itself of the harmonious cohabitation which could come
                            into being between Jews and Arabs - a harmony which should one day reign
                            in a liberated Palestine toward which all of its political efforts are
                            aimed.</p>
                        <p>At this moment, however, a complete normalization of the lot of the Jews
                            is not possible since this would risk once again attracting the thunder
                            bolts of the extremists.</p>

                            OF HIS "MILITARY AND CIVILAIN POSITIONS.” HARDAN, WHO WAS ON OFFICIAL
                            MISSION TO SPAIN WHEN DECISION TAKEN, HAD WHAT LOCAL PRESS TERMED
                            "STORMY SESSION" WITH REPS FROM IRAQI EMBASSY WHEN HE TRANSITED BEIRUT
                            LAST NIGHT. REPORTEDLY EMBASSY OFFICIALS ADVISED HIM NOT RETURN BAGHDAD,
                            BUT TO NO AVAIL.</p>
                        <p>2. THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO OFFICIAL EXPLANATION OF HARDAN'S DISMISSAL,
                            WE HAD BEEN HEARING RUMORS RECENTLY OF DEEP TROUBLE WITHIN RULING BAATH
                            PARTY LEADERSHIP OVER THE FAILURE OF IRAQI TROOPS IN JORDAN TO INTERVENE

                            APPARENTLY PLAYED DECISIVE ROLE IN KEEPING IRAQI FORCES FROM

                            DISPOSAL. IN BEIRUT, MICHEL AFLAQ, FOUNDER OF BAATH PARTY, STRONGLY
                            CRITICIZED <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> FOR REMAINING ALOOF AND

                            PARTY. DURING FIGHTING, ARAFAT SENT TELEGRAM TO PRESIDENT AHMAD HASAN AL
                            BAKR SAYING "HISTORY WILL NOT FORGIVE THOSE WHO FAILED SUPPORT FEDAYEEN
                            BEING MASSACRED BY JORDAN ARMY.”</p>
                        <p>3. THERE HAS LONG BEEN SCHISM BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN WINGS OF
                            RULING BAATH PARTY IN BAGHDAD. HARDAN, FORMER HEAD IRAQI AIR FORCE, HAS
                            APPARENTLY ENJOYED BAKR'S SUPPORT. HOWEVER, IRAQ'S FAILURE TO
                            PARTICIPATE IN JORDAN CIVIL WAR GAVE STRONGMAN SADDAM HUSAYN AT TIKRITI,

                            OBSERVERS HERE BELIEVE BAKR OPTED MAKE HARDAN SCAPEGOAT RATHER THAN GET
                            INTO OPEN CONFLICT WITH CIVILIAN WING OF PARTY. QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER
                            BAKR CAN RETAIN NOMINAL LEADERSHIP OF PARTY AND GOVERNMENT OR WHETHER
                            SADDAM WILL REPLACE HIM. THOUGH BETTING HERE ABOUT EVEN, WE INCLINED
                            FEEL SADDAM'S PENCHANT FOR ANONYMITY WILL KEEP HIM FROM OVERTLY ASSUMING

                            INCLUDE VISIT TO BANDAR ABBAS IN DECEMBER 1970 BY SOV RESEARCH VESSEL
                            CARRYING HELICOPTER, VISIT WHICH WE HAVE JUST LEARNED OF FROM IIN). IT
                            DEMONSTRATES ONCE AGAIN SOVIET DETERMINATION TO INCREASE ITS NAVAL
                            PRESENCE IN VITALLY IMPORTANT PERSIAN GULF ON WHICH JAPAN AND EUROPE
                            NATO DEPEND SO VERY HEAVILY FOR THEIR ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO IS
                            FURTHER PROOF OF SOVIET DECISION (WHICH WE HAVE REPORTED FOR SOME
                            MONTHS) TO DEVELOP NAVAL FACILITY AT UMM QASR, NOMINALLY FOR IRAQ BUT
                            ALSO FOR NAVY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A STEADILY EXPANDING SOVIET PRESENCE
                            NOT ONLY IN INDIAN OCEAN AND ARABIAN SEA, BUT ALSO IN GULF.</p>
                        <p>3. SUCH A SOVIET NAVAL PRESENCE IN GULF COULD, OF COURSE, BE VERY
                            IMPORTANT POLITICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO RADICAL ARAB STATES
                            (PARTICULARLY IRAQ, SOUTHERN YEMEN AND SYRIA) WHEN THEY LAUNCH THEIR
                            MAJOR "NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT" OFFENSIVES AGAINST MODERATE ARAB GULF
                            STATES. QUALIFIED OBSERVERS HERE BELIEVE THIS OFFENSIVE WILL CERTAINLY
                            OCCUR SOMETIME IN 1972, FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL OF MOST OF BRITAIN'S
                            PRESENT MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT IN GULF, SO SOVIET EFFORTS TO COMPLETE
                            AND COMMISSION UMM QASR ARE UNDERSTANDABLE.</p>

                        <p>1. FOR KATHMANDU: Would appreciate Embassy passing to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKS1">Sadruddin Agha Khan</persName>, who
                            understood currently to be visiting NEPAL, following information before
                            his departure for Dacca on March 6. Prince is understood to be planning
                            visit to Baghdad around March 15 possibly before returning to
                            Geneva.</p>
                        <p>2. Department has received several reports during recent weeks of arrests
                            in Baghdad in late December 1970 and early January 1971 of Jewish
                            physicians and pharmacists. Principal source of these reports is
                            American citizen Tawfic Raby, an employee of U. S. Bureau of Standards.
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d280-02" facs="d280-02"/> Raby's brother, Dr.
                            Albert Raby, a physician, is one of thos reportedly arrested. According
                            earlier reports Albert Raby had been released from jail but recent
                            message from US Interests Section of Belgian Embassy in Baghdad
                            indicates he still under arrest.</p>
                        <p>3. According Tawfic Raby's latest information situation of Jews in
                            Baghdad has become "extremely bad.” Help is said to be urgently needed.
                            Reports that some arrested Jewish physicians and pharmacists had been
                            released have turned out to be false, according most recent report.
                            Moreover, around 20 other persons of Jewish faith in Baghdad have been
                            under arrest since early January or late December. This is a separate
                            category from the physicians and pharmacists. Iraqi authorities have
                            given none of arrestees any hint as to reasons behind arrests and few if
                            any of them have been questioned by incarcerating authorities.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d280-03" facs="d280-03"/>
                        <p>4. Names are unavailable of non-physician and non- pharmacist category of
                            arrestees. However, physicians and pharmacists include in addition to
                            five members of the Hakim family, Haskell Nakkar, Daoud Bassoon, Haroun
                            Shemie, Haskell Shohet and his wife Muzli Shohet and Tawfic's brother,
                            Dr. Albert Raby. Tawfic had earlier feared having names of arrestees
                            mentioned to Iraqi authorities on grounds that this might make their
                            situation worse. However, in view of latest reports indicating a
                            worsening situation, he believes an inquiry by High Commissioner about
                            specific persons might be helpful.</p>
                        <p>5. Department hopes that while visiting Baghdad, High Commissioner will
                            inquire into foregoing arrests and express his concern over welfare of
                            these affected. If he could also urge their release from jail and while
                            High Commissioner is still physically present in Baghdad, we believe <pb n="4" xml:id="d280-04" facs="d280-04"/>Iraqis might well respond
                            favorably.</p>
                        <p>6. FOR DACCA: In event Embassy Kathmandu was unable bring foregoing to
                            attention Prince Sadruddin during his Nepal stay, would appreciate your
                            passing information on to him during his scheduled stopover in Dacca
                            from March 6 to March 8.</p>
                        <p>7. FOR BRUSSELS: Please pass foregoing to REPIR Baghdad for
                            information.</p>

                        <p>During a recent call on Michel Sassine, Deputy Speaker of the Lebanese
                            Parliament and companion of Prime Minister Saeb Salem on the latter's
                            six-day official visit to Iraq February 14-21, 1971, he made the
                            following comments on the situation in Iraq:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Regime</p>
                        <p> Sassine believes the present government of <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">Ahmed Hasan al Bakr</persName> is becoming increasingly confident
                            of its ability to remain in power. In conversations with Iraqi
                            dignitaries, Salam and Sassine both had the impression Vice President
                            Salih Mandi '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> is emerging
                            as <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName>'s right hand man and the
                            regime's strongman (qabaday). The former qabaday, Saddam Husayn at
                                <persName>Tikriti</persName>, who played a leading role in bringing
                            about the March 11, 1970 settlement with Kurdish leader Mulla Mustafa
                            Barzani, was conspicuous for his absence at all official gatherings
                            throughout Salam's visit. Sassine noted that Saddam's name was never
                            even mentioned during the six- day visit. (The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> representative in Lebanon gave a <pb n="2" xml:id="d281-02" facs="d281-02"/>similar assessment of the current
                            Iraqi regime to the DCM recently. He said that <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> officials in Baghdad have been able to develop a good
                            relationship with '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName>, whose
                            star seems to be ascending.)</p>
                        <p> Sassine believes the emergence of '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> will enhance the authority of the relatively more
                            pragmatic military wing of the pan-Arab leadership of the Baath Party.
                            Sassine was also favorably impressed with Foreign Minister 'Abd Karim
                            Shaykhali whom he found to be an intelligent, articulate, and effective
                            civilian collaborator with both '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName>.</p>

                        <p> Sassine was particularly impressed by the current regime's almost
                            fanatic "anti-communism.” Iraqi officials told him that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has been quietly encouraging Numeiry's
                            campaign against the Communist Party in the Sudan. '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> and Shaykhali told Sassine that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is at the same time anxious to
                            improve its ties with the West, especially the U.K., to counter-balance
                            the Soviet position in the country. For example, the GOI is now trying
                            to obtain a number of British professors for the faculty of Baghdad
                            University. It would also like to have greater Western European and even
                            American participation in certain industrial development projects. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has not been pleased with the
                            quality of Sovie Bloc project assistance, many of the factories and
                            other installations having turned out to be duds. (The Westinghouse
                            representative in Baghdad, one of the few remaining Americans still
                            working in Iraq, also commented to the reporting officer this week that
                            the Director General of the Ministry of Industry had been "picking his
                            brain" to solve some of the basic technical problems which have arisen
                            in various industrial development projects throughout the country. He
                            mentioned particularly the chemical fertilizer plant at Abu al Khasib,
                            the paper factory at Hartha, the new refinery at Basra, the sulphur
                            extraction plant at Kirkuk, the cane-sugar factory at Majr al Kabir, and
                            the woolen textile mill at Kut.)</p>
                        <p> Sassine added, however, that he detected no indication that the regime's
                            hostility to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy vis-a-vis the
                            Middle East is any less bitter.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iraq-Arab Relations</p>
                        <p> Sassine believes the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is anxious to
                            improve relations with Syria, Lebanon, and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in order to end its relative isolation from these
                            "natural allies.” While Iraq remains as adamantly opposed to a peaceful
                            settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict as ever, it nevertheless wishes
                            to appease the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Sassine believes
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> might even modify the
                            present government to include some non-Baathi elements, perhaps along
                            the lines of the coalition put together by Hafiz al Asad in Syria.
                                '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName>, in conversation with
                            Salam, encouraged Lebanon to exercise its traditional role of Arab
                            mediator and to use its good offices with Sadat to facilitate an
                            Egyptian-Iraqi rapprochement. Sassine also anticipates an improvement in
                            Lebanese-Iraqi relations and that Iraqi tourists will return to Lebanon
                            in large numbers this summer.</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: Sassine's remarks add to the mounting evidence that the present
                            government in Baghdad is continuing to consolidate its position. As for
                            the relative positions of “<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName>
                            and Saddam at <persName>Tikriti</persName>, available information is
                            contradictory. CAS for example, has reported that '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> have put aside their longstanding differences in
                            order more effectively to counter the stronger position of Saddam after
                            the downfall of former Vice President HARDAN at Tikriti in October. On
                            the other hand, some of our press contacts who have been following
                            closely the situation in Iraq tell us they are convinced Saddam's
                            position is virtually unassailable. They also see the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria working behind the scenes in
                            an effort to bring about changes in Baghdad to align Iraq more closely
                            with the mainstream of Arab politics. One observer, for example,
                            challenged the thesis that '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName>'s position relative to Saddam's has improved,
                            noting wryly that '<persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> now
                            makes news only on the sports page (he is head of Iraq's Olympic
                            Preparatory Committee).</p>
                        <p>While it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the conflicting
                            evidence available, we are inclined toward the view that the present
                            government in Baghdad is likely to be around for some time. While some
                            changes in the cast of characters cannot be ruled out, we suspect they
                            are likely to be more cosmetic than meaningful. <pb n="4" xml:id="d281-04" facs="d281-04"/>As far as the Jarring peace mission
                            is concerned, we are confident that the Arab governments directly
                            involved in conflict with Israel will have little difficulty in
                            convincing the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to go along if a
                            settlement is obtained.</p>

                        <p>1. We continue to receive reports that number (now 42) of Jews have bean
                            arrested in Baghdad allegedly for participation in attempts to leave
                            Iraq by clandestine means. In addition, our sources here state that
                            there are strong rumors the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> plans to
                            put these people on trial in the near future.</p>
                        <p>2. Until now we have been waiting for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner for Refugees to undertake a visit to
                            Baghdad re plight of Jews before embarking on any <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> effort on their behalf. High
                            Commissioner was reportedly expected in Baghdad this week, but we have
                            no confirmation his arrival, although <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> reports his meeting with Iraqi President on March 16.

                        <p>3. In addition, Embassy should also raise subject of alleged arrests and
                            possible trial of Jews with Belgian Foreign Ministry, inquiring whether
                            Belgians would be prepared to make approach to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on our behalf. If GOB agreeable, such an approach could
                            be based on increasing appeals for information re condition Iraqi family
                            members by American citizens of the Jewish faith. In this regard, you
                            might also suggest to Belgian Foreign Ministry possibility of
                            coordinating such an approach with Dutch, whose Ambassador in Baghdad,
                            according to Belgian Ambassador there, has reliable information re

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Over last six to eight months we have received reliable reports of
                            arrests of Iraqi Jews, including several prominent doctors and other
                            community leaders. Reason for these arrests is alleged involvement these
                            persons in efforts leave Iraq clandestinely. Current reports place the
                            number of arrested at 42. In addition, more recently there are
                            indications that Iraqi regime may be planning trials of all or some of
                            those arrested. Because of the state of our relations with Iraq,
                            representation on behalf of Iraqi Jews by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not likely to be helpful. Nevertheless, we have asked
                            the Belgians who represent us in Baghdad to express our concern for
                            imprisoned relatives of American citizens. <pb n="2" xml:id="d284-02" facs="d284-02"/>We believe, however, that on humanitarian grounds,
                            other governments might be in position to make more effective case with
                            the Iraqi regime on behalf of these unfortunates. In this regard, we
                            understand that the Israeli Government has already approached the
                            British, Dutch and French. While we realize that these efforts may
                            achieve little and might even backfire, we believe that in view of the
                            recent reports of possible trials some action must be taken to alert the
                            Iraqi government to negative effect such trials or severe punishment
                            would have on world opinion.</p>
                        <p>2. Action posts are requested to inform their host governments of the
                            above information and request that they consider (a) making inquiries re
                            the safety of Iraqi Jews currently being held (names of those known to
                            be held being sent separately); (b) expressing concern over recent
                            reports that these persons may be put on trial in the <pb n="3" xml:id="d284-03" facs="d284-03"/>near future; (c) advising Iraqi
                            government of the negative effect such trials, if held, would have on
                            world opinion, and; (d) authorizing their respective <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Missions take up matter with SecGen.</p>
                        <p>3. FYI. We are making an informal approach through Ambassador Finger at

                        <p>1. Oil companies have offered Iraq and Saudi Arabia higher price for oil
                            exported by pipeline from Eastern Mediterranean terminals which is
                            comparable to new price reached in negotiations with Libya, after
                            adjustments for transportation, gravity, and sulphur content. Iraq has
                            rejected offer and demanded additional 20 cent premium for the special
                            qualities of its oil, and reinvestment commitment by companies in
                            desulphurization installations in Iraq. Companies believe they cannot
                            accept Iraqi demands which would leave them open to demands for further
                            upward price adjustments elsewhere.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d285-02" facs="d285-02"/>
                        <p>2. Saudi Arabian Petroleum Minister Yamani has told companies that at
                            Tripoli meeting April 9-10, Iraqi Oil Minister Hammadi tried to get
                            Libyan and Saudi support for Iraqi position. According to Yamani,
                            Hammadi asked Libyans not to "leapfrog" and make further demands from
                            the companies if Iraq received premium. Outcome of meeting was not
                            revealed, but Yamani said there was some friction between Libyans and
                            Iraqis as each claimed to be the most militant in dealing with
                            companies. Hammadi said he would take his case before <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> if companies did not give in to Iraqi
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>3. Yamani has given companies choice of signing agreement now with Saudi
                            Arabia on terms offered by the companies provided they do not give Iraq
                            more favorable terms, or not signing agreement now in which case he will
                            use his influence with Iraqi to make reasonable common settlement.
                            Companies are leaning toward signing now with Saudi Arabia. Companies
                            have also given thought to making sharing agreement <pb n="3" xml:id="d285-03" facs="d285-03"/>with <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> in case Iraq oil production is shut down, but have
                            decided against such a move for time being.</p>
                        <p>4. Syria has told IPC that since companies have given short haul premium
                            to Libya, companies should also increase transit fees for pipelines
                            crossing Syria delivering shorthaul crude to Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>5. Meanwhile Iranian Finance Minister AMUZEGAR told Consortium General
                            Manager VAN REEVEN that Shah was "displeased" with size of price
                            increase given Libya by companies. AMUZEGAR said companies had "paid too
                            much in Libya" and that Iranian posted price was now 10 to 19 cents too
                            low. He also said 10 cent low and sulphur premium given Libya was too
                            high and "side payment" to Libya (instead of retroactive price increase)
                            was "objectionable.” However no specific demands for higher prices were
                            made by Iranians. Van Reevan told Amuzegar Iran should take heart since
                            Libya pricing was pricing its crude out of the European market.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d285-04" facs="d285-04"/>
                        <p>6. Having given low sulphur premium to Libyans, companies now expect that
                            Abu Dhabi and Oman will demand premium for their low sulphur crudes. Abu
                            Dhabi exports crude with 0.8 percent sulphur (1.9 percent in derived
                            fuel oil) and Oman exports crude with 1.2 percent sulphur (1.8 percent
                            in derived fuel oil). This is a lower sulphur content than other Persian
                            Gulf crudes, but higher than Libyan crude which contains less than 0.5
                            percent sulphur.</p>

                        <p>1. During call on Asst. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            on April 19, Ambassador Van de Kerchove, Belgian Ambassador to Iraq,
                            characterized internal situation in Iraq as one of relative stability.
                            However, rivalries continue within Baathist Party leadership. Soviet
                            influence is increasing, particularly in commercial area. Soviet
                            political influence, on other hand, is not strong. At moment relations
                            between Iraq and Soviet Union are strained, flowing essentially from
                            Soviet unhappiness with continued Iraqi persecution of Communists. Also
                            Soviets are unhappy with Iraq's negative attitude toward a peace
                            settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d286-02" facs="d286-02"/>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> inquired whether, as is
                            currently case in certain other Arab countries, there is a QTE loosening
                            up UNQTE in attitudes? Ambassador thought not. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked whether Soviet presence is
                            considerable. Ambassador said his Soviet colleagues were almost
                            invariably critical of Iraqi Government, both with regard to
                            government's persecution of Communists as well as with respect to
                            difficulties Soviets are experiencing in working with Iraqis in
                            implementing economic projects.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked whether Ambassador
                            would characterize regime as totalitarian. The Ambassador replied in
                            affirmative with important exception that Kurds are permitted freedom of
                            exression. Kurdish views are expressed in particular in daily Kurdish
                            newspaper al Ta'akhi. But, Ambassador emphasized, this is only form of
                            freedom permitted in Iraq today.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s question
                            re Iraq's attitude toward peace settlement, Ambassador said that Iraqi
                            Government would not openly support peace settlement, but it would do
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d286-03" facs="d286-03"/>nothing to prevent
                            achivevement. Among other things, lack of a common boundary between Iraq
                            and Israel affords Iraq luxury of dissociating itself from
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> inquired re Iraqi
                            Government's attitude on Palestinian movement. Ambassador replied that
                            while Iraqi Government gives fedayeen QTE theoretical support UNQTE,
                            Government as practical matter does very little to help fedayeen
                            movement. For one thing Iraqi regime is apprehensive regarding potential
                            rivalry from a strong fedayeen movement. Ambassador agreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s observation that
                            Iraqi Government has now turned inward.</p>
                        <p>6. Ambassador noted that Iraq is taking an increasing interest in Persian
                            Gulf but said it has few assets to work with in this connection. Iraqi
                            Army is weak. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked whether
                            Iraqi Government has made issue over ownership of Islands of Tunbs and
                            Abu Musa. Ambassador replied that, to his knowledge, subject <pb n="4" xml:id="d286-04" facs="d286-04"/>has never been mentioned in Iraqi
                            press. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> commented that Iraq
                            seemed to be isolated even from mainstream of Arab world. Ambassador
                            said that Iraqi Army is generally unpopular in country and noted that
                            recent celebration of Army's 50th anniversary was held outside Baghdad
                            and was attended essentially by members of diplomatic corps and foreign
                            delegates.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to question about Kurds, Ambassador said that both Kurds
                            and Iraqi Government know that neither side can win. Thus they are ready
                            to cooperate within limits, but Kurds are prepared to resume fighting if
                            necessary. Kurds remain well armed and in a sense are small state within
                            a state.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked about current Iraqi
                            attitudes toward Jordan. Ambassador said that Iraqi Government has no
                            intention of interfering in Jordan, and he noted recent withdrawal of
                            most Iraqi troops from that country. He said it appears as if Iraqis are
                                <pb n="5" xml:id="d286-05" facs="d286-05"/>not really interested In
                            Jordan now, perhaps in part because a increased Iraqi preoccupation with
                            the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> inquired about Iraqi
                            relations with Iran. Ambassador said that five months ago relations with
                            Iran were bad, but they improved during recent <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> oil negotiations in Tehran. He expected, however that
                            relations between two countries would again deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>10. In response to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s
                            question re economic situation, Ambassador said that last year was a bad
                            one for Iraq from an economic standpoint. It had an unfavorable balance
                            of trade, and there had been a drought. This year seemed to be slightly
                            better in both areas. Additional oil revenues resulting from recent
                            agreements will help situation.</p>

                        <p>1. At meeting with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> reps May 2 Iraq
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> presented
                            list of eight demands, two of which he said were non-negotiable. If
                            companies did not reach agreement with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> by Thursday May 6, <persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                            legislate. If companies refused to go along with legislation, Ammash
                            said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would nationalize <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and sell the oil itself, "even if this
                            means accepting only one dollar per barrel.” If other companies tried to
                            help <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> by taking collective action
                            against Iraq, <persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> said Iraq
                            would "resort to all means necessary" and "companies would also lose
                            Kuwait and <pb n="2" xml:id="d287-02" facs="d287-02"/>Saudi Arabia,
                            because if Arab brethren do not stand by Iraq,” Iraq "would use force to

                        <p>2. Despite these drastic threats, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            negotiators said meeting with Ammash was cordial and Iraqis seemed
                            genuinely interested in reaching negotiated solution. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> team now in London and will return to
                            Baghdad to see <persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> May 6, but
                            present indications are they will not be empowered to go very far
                            towards meeting demands.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> gave <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> a paper listing eight demands, the last
                            two of which he said were non-negotiable. Demands were as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Increase liftings at Basrah to 36 million tons this year. (Comment:
                            present capacity of terminal at Khor al Amaya is 30 million tons
                            annually (600,000 b/d) and <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has given
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> promise of "best endeavor" to
                            lift 28 million tons this year. Export capacity at Fao is 10 million
                            tons annually, but this facility has been given to INOC by <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>).</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d287-03" facs="d287-03"/>
                        <p>B. Invest new capital to increase capacity of Khor al Amaya above 36
                            million tons anually and make it capable of receiving tankers of up to
                            250,000 dw tons. (Comment: <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> has been
                            promoting idea within <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> of expanding
                            Khor al Amaya along these lines, and there is some indication other
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> members might be willing to go
                            along with some expansion there.)</p>
                        <p>C. Compensation in regard to injustices suffered since 1965. (This
                            presumably refers to lack of agreement on royalty expensing between 1965
                            and 1970).</p>
                        <p>D. Payment of the accumulated debt as a result of the disparity
                            recognized in the Tehran agreement between the Basrah and Ras Tanura
                            posted prices. (This is presumably a claim for a 6 cent increase in the
                            posted price for Basrah crude retroactive to 1965, following the 6 cent
                            "adjustment" in the Basrah price agreed upon at Tehran. This claim would
                            cost <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> about 36 million dollars.)</p>
                        <p>E. Payment of 40 million Dinars (112 million dollars) <pb n="4" xml:id="d287-04" facs="d287-04"/>as partial payment of the
                            accumulated claims of Iraq against <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>.
                            (This is similar to "C" above; 40 million dinars represents half of
                            Iraq's current claims against <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>F. A two cent increase in the Tripoli/Banias posted price because of the
                            injustice suffered in the past by the posted price on the Jambur/Bai
                            Hassan blend. (The posted price of this crude in the past was 10 cents
                            per barrel lower than other equivalent crudes because of certain poor
                            quality characteristics. In the current offer by <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, the posted
                            price of this blend has been brought into line with the price of other
                            Iraqi crudes. A two cent increase in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s posted price offer would being the Tripoli/Banias posting
                            to $3.23 for 36 gravity <gloss target="#t_API1">API</gloss> crude.</p>
                        <p>G. (non-negotiable). The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wants a
                            letter from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> stating it will adjust
                            the border value of crude in Iraq's favor within three months. (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> interprets this to mean <pb n="5" xml:id="d287-05" facs="d287-05"/>that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is insisting on the "Sidon formula" demanded by Hamadi
                            in earlier negotiations. Under this formula, taxes and royalties would
                            be based on the posted price of crude at the Mediterranean terminals
                            rather than on the "border value" of the crude as it passes across the
                            border from Iraq to Syria. This "Sidon formula" would increase <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> take in taxes and royalties by about 6
                            cents per barrel over the "border value" formula now used.)</p>
                        <p>H. (Non-negotiable). Iraq also wants an exchange of letters with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> stating and recognizing that Iraq
                            reserves its position on the sulphur premium given Libya. (The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has insisted that the companies had no
                            justification for giving Libya a 10 cent posted price increase because
                            of the low sulphur content of Libyan crude, and therefore must give Iraq
                            some further upward price adjustment in compensation.)</p>
                        <p>4. At one point in the talks, <persName corresp="#p_ASM1">Ammash</persName> also mentioned that he wanted the capacity of the
                            Khor al Amaya terminal <pb n="6" xml:id="d287-06" facs="d287-06"/>increased because <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would soon "wish
                            to sell large quantities of crude to <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>.” <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> interprets this
                            remark to mean <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has had difficulty in
                            making arrangements for the transportation and sale of crude from
                            Northern Rumaila, and may now, finally, be contemplating some
                            arrangement with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> that would move
                            towards resolving this thorny problem.</p>
                        <p>5. To our knowledge, negotiations with Tapline still suspended pending
                            resolution of negotiations with Iraq.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Despite our request to use discretion with information re status of Iraqi
                            Jews being provided him in a letter dated April 21 (see attached),
                            Senator Javits released the full text of this letter on May 3 to the
                            Jewish Telegraph Agency.* Inter alia our letter states that we requested
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner for Refugees
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_AKS1">SADRUDDIN KHAN</persName> to
                            intercede with the Iraqi President on behalf of Iraqi Jews then being
                            detained by the Baghdad regime. The Prince is now understandably
                            concerned that this disclosure will compromise his position vis-a-vis
                            the Iraqis. We too are concerned because we had endeavored to play down
                            our involvement on behalf of the Iraqi Jews lest the Iraqi Government
                            believe we have been orchestrating a campaign against it and therefore
                            decide not to relax its pressure against the Iraqi Jewish community. The
                            fact that the Iraqi News Agency has now focused on this item underscores
                            our concern.</p>
                        <p>We have asked Ambassador Symms in H to convey our regret over this
                            disclosure to Senator Javits attention. At the same time we have
                            contacted Mr. Tawfic Raby, the Iraqi Jew most active in organizing
                            efforts on behalf of his co-religionists and expressed our dismay about
                            the possible negative effect this disclosure may have on our future
                            attempts to help the Iraqi Jews. He expressed his full understanding of
                            our concern and said he would also speak to Senator Javits' office.</p>

                        <p>Honorable JACOB K. JAVITS<lb/> United States Senate<lb/> Washington, D.
                            C.</p>
                        <p>Dear Senator Javits:</p>
                        <p>The Secretary has asked me to reply to your letter of April 2 concerning
                            recent reports of arrests of Iraqi Jews. The Department has been
                            following the situation very closely, in particular Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> and the Bureau of Near
                            Eastern and South Asian Affairs as well as Ambassador Finger at the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have no diplomatic or consular relations with the Iraqi
                            Government and our access to that government is, therefore, limited.
                            When we first started receiving reports of arrests of Iraqi Jews,
                            however, we approached the British, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and
                            Swiss Governments and asked that they consider interceding on behalf of
                            those being detained. In the meantime, we instructed the Belgians, who
                            represent us in Baghdad, to express our concern to the Iraqi Government
                            about the plight of those arrested who were relatives of American
                            citizens. We also exchanged information with the Israeli Embassy here in
                            Washington. Finally, we were in close contact with Prince <persName corresp="#p_AKS1">SADRUDDIN KHAN</persName>, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner for Refugees, who at our request
                            stopped in Baghdad during an Asian tour and made personal inquiries and
                            appeals to the President of Iraq on behalf of the Iraqi Jewish
                            community. These approaches and appeals have apparently been successful
                            and we are now pleased to report that according to reliable information
                            all those arrested have been released. We will certainly continue to
                            watch developments in Iraq closely and will endeavor to do what we
                            can.</p>

                        <p>Given the unpredictable situation in Iraq, I am sure you can appreciate
                            the need for discretion with regard to the release of the above
                            information.</p>
                        <p>I trust that this information has been responsive to your inquiry. If you
                            have any further questions, however, please let us know.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>During the past two years we have engaged in exchanges and formal
                            negotiations with the Iraqi Government in an effort to arrive at a
                            mutually acceptable response to its request to purchase our Embassy
                            Baghdad property. This property is adjacent to the Iraqi Presidential
                            palace. During February talks in Baghdad, our team was unable to agree
                            to an Iraqi offer which included a price below the actual construction
                            costs of the buildings. The talks were then broken off by the Iraqis who
                            said they would seek other "legal" means to acquire the property. Soon
                            thereafter the Iraqi Government informed us that our Embassy property
                            had to be vacated by May 15 because of its location in a military zone.
                            Although recognizing our continued right to the buildings, the Iraqis
                            stated that they would decide what "compensation" would be paid. While
                            not spelling out the consequences, implied in the Iraqi notification was
                            a threat of unilateral seizure.</p>
                        <p>At our request the Belgian Ambassador, who represents us in Baghdad,
                            subsequently reiterated our offer to resume negotiations; indicated that
                            unilaterally-decided compensation was unacceptable; and stated that he
                            would not vacate the property under duress. In a formal reply the Iraqi
                            Government (a) indicated it had <pb n="2" xml:id="d290-02" facs="d290-02"/>no desire to violate the Vienna Convention; (b)
                            argued that it had the right to request evacuation of diplomatic
                            premises from a military zone; and (c) insisted that the property be
                            vacated by May 15.</p>
                        <p>On May 14 the Iraqi Government informed the Belgian Ambassador that it
                            was giving the Belgians an additional week, until May 22, in order to
                            complete the evacuation of the property. As a last resort, we requested
                            the Belgian Government to authorize the Belgian Ambassador - -to inform
                            the Iraqi Government of his decision to evacuate and seal the USG
                            diplomatic premises pending a final legal and amicable settlement. On
                            May 22 the Iraqis formally rejected this proposal and gave the Belgians
                            an additional day for evacuation. On May 23 the Belgian Ambassador was
                            informed that all exits to the property were being blocked and he was
                            requested to turn over the keys to the property. Under protest the
                            Belgian Ambassador has evacuated the property but has refused with our
                            concurrence to turn over the keys because he believes such an act would
                            demonstrate acquiescence to this unilateral seizure.</p>
                        <p>We are now considering ways by which we might demonstrate our displeasure
                            with the Iraqi regime over this seizure, including (a) a strong note of
                            protest, (b) blocking Iraqi assets in the United States; and(c)
                            recalling the two Iraqi diplomats manning the Iraqi Interests Section in
                            Washington. However, beyond the above possibilities, we have little
                            political or other leverage over the Iraqis to reverse their seizure
                            decision. At the same time, we believe we have established a strong case
                            for restitution of this property by a successor regime, or for fair
                            compensation thereof in connection with the resumption of relations at
                            some point in the future.</p>

                            Ambassador Van de Kerckhove: QUOTE: The American interests in Iraq are
                            essentially related to American citizens residing in Iraq and the shares
                            of American oil companies in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Three
                            hundred thirty five American nationals residing Iraq are, with the
                            exception of some technicians, either spouses of Iraqis or children born
                            to American wives. I do not feel that Iraqi Government would take
                            measures against these American nationals. It does not rpt not look
                            either as if Iraqi Government would be able to take measures against
                            share amounting to 23.75 percent which American companies are holding in
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> since it is difficult to take
                            such measures without causing trouble to <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> as such. Most likely reaction from Iraqi Government if
                            measures contemplated were executed would probably <pb n="2" xml:id="d291-02" facs="d291-02"/>be to accentuate the anti-American
                            posture of its present policy. The Iraqi Government would be more
                            inclined to do so in that, since the Egyptian position has become
                            softer, it is claiming to have the monopoly of the anti-imperialist
                            struggle in the Arab world and hopes by doing so to gain some political
                            benefits. Furthermore the retaliatory measures envisaged by the State
                            Department look at the first sight rather inefficient. The proposal to
                            withdraw Iraqi diplomats attached to Indian Embassy might result in
                            retaliatory measures taken by Iraqi Government against Belgian diplomats
                            attached to <gloss target="#t_USINT1">USINT</gloss>. Request to withdraw
                            Iraqi diplomats may also antagonize Indian Government. Blocking payments
                            of about two and a half million dollars is deemed perhaps insufficient
                            to embarrass seriously Iraqi Government and would enable it to present
                            itself as a victim. I believe that retaliatory measures envisaged by
                            Department of State might have unfavourable repercussions on relations
                            between Belgium and Iraq. It is very <pb n="3" xml:id="d291-03" facs="d291-03"/>difficult to make military authorities now running
                            Iraq understand the distinction between the Belgian Embassy and the
                            service of the Belgian Embassy offering its good offices to protect
                            American interests in Iraq. Iraqi Government is already very is much
                            antagonized against Belgian Embassy because it has refused to leave
                            voluntarily premises USA compound and has thus compelled Iraqi Army
                            delegation to occupy said premises by force. Iraqi authorities insist
                            that lack of cooperation from Belgian Embassy is considered violation of
                            Iraqi laws and intrusion into internal affairs of Iraq. American
                            retaliatory measures would likely aggravate Belgian position. Among
                            measures which Iraqi Government might take against Belgium one should
                            envisage possibility head of <gloss target="#t_USINT1">USINT</gloss>
                            section or even Ambassador himself declared persona non grata. Since
                            Iraqi external trade is dependent on the state, measures which are being
                            contemplated might influence Iraqi importations from Belgium. I wonder
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d291-04" facs="d291-04"/>whether Belgian
                            Government after having transmitted USA protest could not rpt not
                            suggest to submit the problem of USA Embassy premises to arbitration all
                            the more as USA Government's moral and juridicial position looks strong

                        <p> Zayid Uthman, believed to be a close associate of Iraqi Kurdish leader
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mustafa Barzani</persName>, has conveyed
                            to Embassy Beirut a purported request from <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            for clandestine talks between representatives of his faction and
                            representatives of the U.S. Government. <persName>Barzani</persName> is
                            reportedly interested in investigating the possibility of U.S. support
                            for a Kurdish-Arab insurrection against the Iraqi regime. Uthman was
                            told that it is U.S. policy not to become involved in internal struggles
                            of foreign countries. After two weeks in London with his family, Uthman
                            intends to return via Beirut and may call at the Embassy to see if the
                            U.S. position has changed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Message from <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mustafa
                                Barzani</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p> Zayid Uthman, a Barzani Kurd, called at the Embassy July 8 to convey
                            what he said was a message from <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mustafa
                                Barzani</persName> to the U.S. Government. Uthman began by saying
                            that <persName>Barzani</persName>'s dream is cooperation with the United
                            States. <pb n="2" xml:id="d292-02" facs="d292-02"/>
                            <persName>Barzani</persName> would like the U.S. Government to
                            understand that Kurdish justice will not be satisfied until Iraq is
                            governed by a democratic regime representing both Arabs and Kurds and
                            protecting the principles of Kurdish Society by according the Kurdish
                            community its "national rights of autonomy.” Uthman said Barzani wants
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to know that the Kurds have
                            disregarded requests from the Baathist regime in Baghdad to take
                            "hostile action" against Iran. Likewise, the
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> Kurds have never incited the Kurds of
                            Turkey against their government or otherwise intervened in Turkish
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>In <persName>Barzani</persName>'s opinion, the Baathist regime in Iraq is
                            mistreating the Iraqi people. The <persName>Barzani</persName> Kurds
                            dislike and distrust that regime. Although circumstances forced them to
                            sign an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, they
                            never expected the Baathists to honor it. The Kurds are now ready to
                            rise against that Government. If necessary, they will participate with
                            anti-regime Arabs in a general uprising. They already have contact with
                            non-Kurdish elements.</p>
                        <p>The government that would emerge from such an uprising would be
                            pro-American. <persName>Barzani</persName> would like the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to take a sympathetic look at the Iraqi
                            situation. <persName>Barzani</persName> stands ready to consult with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in every political matter, to
                            implement U.S. policy, and to sweep anti-U.S. elements from his area of
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, said Uthman, if the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            should consider these points worthy of discussion,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> would be honored to receive official
                            U.S. representatives at his headquarters in Kurdistan or to send his
                            son, Idris, and Zayid Uthman to Washington for meetings with U.S.
                            officials.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>In response to questions, Uthman provided the following background to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>'s proposal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Barzani</persName> is in full control of the mountainous strip
                            from the Iranian border west to Ruwanduz. Although the major cities of
                            Kurdistan are in government hands, they are closely surrounded <pb n="3" xml:id="d292-03" facs="d292-03"/>by <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            forces in the mountains.</p>
                        <p>Under the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<persName>Barzani</persName> agreement of March 1970,
                            the Kurds dissolved their Revolutionary Council and Executive Committee.
                            However, the administrative machinery required to govern their area is
                            still, operative. <persName>Barzani</persName> is paying each man in his
                            standing army five dinars every two months. To meet the continuing
                            expenses of maintaining his regime and his army, he needs financial
                            assistance. Any such assistance from the U.S. Government could be
                            provided indirectly — via Saudia Arabia, Jordan, or Iran. In the past,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> received subsidies from Iran but in
                            return Iran insisted on maintaining such heavy-handed control over
                            Kurdish activities -including the designation of the Prime Minister in
                            the projected government — that it caused the failure of the whole
                            revolutionary effort. Uthman mentioned glumly that Iran was deeply
                            involved in the all-Arab conspiracy against the Baghdad regime whose
                            failure led to the hanging of some 50 conspirators in 1970. Uthman
                            seemed to feel that, for Iran, the outcome was par for the course.</p>
                        <p>In any event, <persName>Barzani</persName> would like to establish secret
                            relations with the U.S. Government, from which he would like to obtain
                            "advice" about how to proceed in his revolutionary action against the
                            Iraqi regime. One possibility would be for an American representative to
                            visit <persName>Barzani</persName>'s headquarters — a "mud hut" in Haj
                            'Umaran, which is three kilometers from the Iranian border and 2 1/2
                            hours by car from the Iranian city of Rida'iye (phonetic), which can be
                            reached by plane from Tehran. Obviously the Iranian government would
                            know of any such visit, but it could be kept secret from the government
                            of Iraq.</p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> chose to receive a
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> deputation in Washington, it would be
                            headed by Idris, age 27, the ablest of <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            six sons. Idris does not speak much English, but he would be accompanied
                            by Uthman.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Insurrection Plans</p>
                        <p> Uthman expressed the view that Baathist control is too strong to permit
                            a successful coup d'etat in the capital. The army is generally unhappy
                            with the situation but no one dares to act <pb n="4" xml:id="d292-04" facs="d292-04"/>against the regime. Consequently, the only hope lies
                            in insurrection, starting from the area controlled by the Kurds in the
                            north. <persName>Barzani</persName> hopes to convince the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> that it should support such an
                            insurrection. He is now 68. If he dies before Iraq is liberated, Uthman
                            said, there is great danger that the Kurdish liberation movement will be
                            taken over by radical elements and the larger Kurdish community in
                            Turkey will be infected by this same radicalism.</p>
                        <p> Uthman is now actively engaged in seeking assistance for the
                            insurrection. He has authority from <persName>Barzani</persName> to go
                            anywhere—to Washington or to the United Nations, for example. Iran has
                            already promised to help if and when the fighting starts. Uthman visited
                            King Feisal several months ago. Feisal gave him a friendly reception and
                            endorsed the idea of an Iraqi revolt in principle, but asked for further
                            elaboration before giving a reply.</p>
                        <p> Uthman said that he was leaving Beirut shortly for London to meet his
                            family, who were flying in from Baghdad. His wife's sister has rented an
                            apartment for them at 44 Adam and Eve Mews, W.8, London (telephone:
                            WES-5999).</p>
                        <p>Toward the end of July, Uthman plans to return to Beirut and may call at
                            the Embassy to see if there is any new development in the U.S. position.
                            He may also call on Kings Hussein and Feisal.</p>

                        <p> Zayid Uthman, about 47, studied at the University of Cairo (before the
                            revolution) and then practiced law in Baghdad. In 1966 he helped draft
                            the Kurdish-Iraqi agreement with Prime Minister Bazzaz. He says that he
                            has been jailed in Baghdad for political reasons five times during his
                            political career.</p>

                            rejoin his family in Baghdad after the march 1970 agreement between
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> because he has no confidence in the sincerity of the

                        <p> Uthman is modest about his proficiency in English but he is actually
                            quite competent in that language. He has a quiet, convincing manner of

                        <p>1. SUMMARY. We inclined to agree with Embassy Tehran that much of what
                            Lebanese journalist Edward Saab reports on Iraq is overdrawn. In
                            particular we question assumptions that (a) Iraq's influence in area is
                            rapidly growing; (b) Iraq in midst of economic boom; and (c) Iraqi
                            Government's hands no longer tied by Kurdish threat. Our reasons for
                            questioning these assumptions, as well as comments on Saab's other
                            points, discussed below. We would acknowledge that Soviet influence in
                            Iraq appears to be growing, particularly in oil sphere. END SUMMARY </p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d294-02" facs="d294-02"/>
                        <p>2. Iraqi influence in Area: We note Iraqi emissaries have recently made
                            the rounds to various Arab capitals with personal messages from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> to respective
                            heads of state. This move no doubt represents Iraqi attempt to break out
                            of its isolation, as does recent conciliatory statement by <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSSEIN</persName> re Kuwaiti border
                            dispute and Iraqi decision to reopen border with Jordan to commercial
                            traffic. However, there is little evidence that Iraqis have yet won
                            acceptance in other Arab capitals. Although Iraqis pushing hard in
                            Persian Gulf and obviously concerned with future role of Iran vis-a-vis
                            Gulf states, we unable discern any appreciable upswing of Iraqi
                            influence in this area. Given traditional animosity between Iraqi regime
                            and Governments of Syria and Egypt, plus improvement of Saudi-Egyptian
                            relations, we see little likelihood that Iraq will be able to expand its
                            influence very much in Arab world.</p>
                        <p>3. Iraqi Economic Situation: Although Iraq is country having great
                            potential for economic development, Central <pb n="3" xml:id="d294-03" facs="d294-03"/>Government has never been known for its brilliance
                            in economic planning. Oil company source who follows Iraqi economy
                            reports Iraqi leaders spend little time in <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and in Bath National Council discussing economic
                            problems. Apparent concern of these leaders is essentially with
                            appearances of improvement, emphasizing economic philosophies which meet
                            with general public approval. Although <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has greatly increased its revenue as result of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> agreements, we continue to receive
                            reports that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> strapped for cash and
                            has requested sizable loans from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            over past six months. In addition, this has reportedly been bad year for
                            grain crops in North and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may seek to
                            import large amounts of grain to feed population. Development of North
                            Rumalia oil fields is proceeding with large-scale Russian, and East
                            European technical assistance but has not yet resulted in payoff.
                            Finally, we note large Iraqi debt to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for previous arms and economic assistance. According
                            to various reports, difficulty of GOI in meeting these debts has <pb n="4" xml:id="d294-04" facs="d294-04"/>been source of friction in
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. All in all, we skeptical that economic
                            situation in Iraq will see dramatic improvement, given GOI propensity
                            for haphazard economic planning and high expenditures for defense.</p>
                        <p>4. Kurdish-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> Situation: It seems to us
                            that relations between Kurds and Central Government best characterized
                            by mutual distrust and suspicion. <persName>Barzani</persName>, as well
                            as other spokesmen for Kurdish Democratic Party (KPD), have consistently
                            taken <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to task for not fulfilling its
                            obligations under March 11, 1970, agreement which ended civil war
                            between Kurds and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. While it
                            difficult to assess <persName>Barzani</persName>'s capability to resume
                            conflict with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, we have received
                            continuing reports that <persName>Barzani</persName>'s representatives
                            are looking for outside assistance for such an eventuality. Events such
                            as recent assassination attempt against <persName>Barzani</persName> and
                            his belief that Central Government behind this attempt obviously deepen
                            distrust and suspicion between two sides. In this respect, we note
                            recent report carried Beirut's An-Nahar newspaper <pb n="5" xml:id="d294-05" facs="d294-05"/>that <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            has threatened to revise his attitude toward peace agreement with
                            Central Government unless Kurds are given more say in running state
                            affairs. Although Kurds presently hold portfolios in Iraqi cabinet, they
                            continue to be excluded from councils of power, especially <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Relations with Soviet Union and Position of Iraqi Communist Party:
                            Soviet influence over Iraq as result of Russian military and economic
                            assistance is undoubtedly considerable. Iraqi dependence on Soviet arms
                            supply continues, and Soviets are establishing important foothold in oil
                            complex. Soviets no doubt are pleased that they are evidently making
                            more headway in Iraq than in Syria and Egypt, but Soviets can hardly
                            envisage making Iraq counterweight to Egypt. Iraq's continued opposition
                            to peaceful settlement of Arab-Israeli conflict represents at least one
                            difference with Soviets; it pleases Peking, however, and latter has
                            shown interest in closer ties with Iraq. With regard to Iraqi <pb n="6" xml:id="d294-06" facs="d294-06"/>Communist Party, up until now it
                            has been severely repressed by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. This
                            has also been source of friction between <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If indeed
                            Saddam decides to bring Communists into Government, this will represent
                            important shift although Saab indicates only possibility of Communist
                            participation in consultative rather than executive body. Regardless of
                            whatever temporary arrangements are made for Communist participation in
                            Government, it is unlikely that these arrangements will stand up over
                            time.</p>

                        <p>1. We believe Soviets and Iraqis signed military agreement last September
                            when Iraqi Defense Minister was in Moscow. Agreement was substantial,
                            perhaps largest yet, and probably brought grand total of Soviet military
                            aid extensions to Iraq well over three quarter billion dollar level.
                            Grechko's December visit probably resulted in follow-on within framework
                            of basic September agreement. Delivery schedule probably will extend
                            over several years and include ground equipment and aircraft. While we
                            understand Soviets apparently ready to sign friendship treaties with all
                            corners, we have no information supporting speculation that treaty or
                            undertakings in Indian or Egyptian styles signed with Iraqis.</p>
                        <p>2. Soviets probably were no longer able to resist Iraqi pressure for
                            getting arms supply off ad hoc basis and under comprehensive umbrella
                            agreement as Soviets have done with Egypt and Syria. We also would
                            underline point <pb n="2" xml:id="d295-02" facs="d295-02"/>made in
                            Moscow's 557 relating to Soviet stance on Iranian seizure of Gulf
                            islands as clear indication of lack of leverage either side has in
                            non-bilateral matters and of Soviet dedication to maintaining good
                            relations with Iran. In this regard, while we can understand Iranian
                            concern in face of new Soviet-Iraqi arms deal (basically because of
                            Iraqi recklessness and ambitions in Gulf), we do not think Soviets have
                            increased military aid to Iraq as part of aggressive policy in Gulf
                            aimed at Iran. However, as investment increases, Soviets may become even
                            less inclined to jeopardize relationship with Iraq and therefore less
                            able to resist Iraqi pressures for even more military and economic
                            assistance. In sum, our view is that Iraqi arms deal designed to placate
                            Baghdad, not to pose threat to Shah.</p>
                        <p>3. In passing, should also be noted inclination to work both sides of
                            street characteristic feature of Soviet policy and not restricted to
                            Iran-Iraq situation. Soviets, for example, pursuing this potentially

                        <p>1. As Embassy aware, following break in US-Iraq diplomatic relations both
                            countries agreed by exchange of diplomatic notes dated August 30, 1967,
                            and September 14, 1967, to establish on basis of reciprocity Interests
                            Sections in their respective capitals consisting of one Third Secretary
                            and two non-diplomatic personnel. For various reasons, including
                            unwillingness assign inexperienced junior diplomatic officer, we have
                            not rpt not chosen exercise our right in this regard. Iraq, however, not
                            only has done so but has over years without seeking prior agreement
                            escalated rank of its diplomatic representative to First Secretary and,
                            in addition to one non-diplomatic "accountant" has also recently
                            assigned Cultural Attache, diplomatic position not provided for by
                            existing agreement. We have not rpt not made issue of these developments
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d296-02" facs="d296-02"/>in order enable us
                            designate higher ranking diplomatic officer if and when decision finally
                            made send Americans to Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>2. We now believe time suitable to assign American personnel to man US
                            Interests Section in Baghdad because (a) American commercial interest in
                            Iraq has recently been growing due to Iraq's relatively good financial
                            position as result of increased oil revenues over last year; (b)
                            Department's desire for more regular and analytic political and economic
                            reporting from Iraq as well as for closer administrative control over
                            Interests Section as a whole.</p>
                        <p>3. In view of above, Department now envisages assignment sometime during
                            this summer of one junior FS0-3 or senior <gloss target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss>-4 Arab area and language officer and one <gloss target="#t_FSS1">FSS</gloss>-5 Administrative Assistant, whose wife
                            would also work. We doubt that the Iraqi Government would react
                            negatively to assignment these persons in view of presence Iraqi <pb n="3" xml:id="d296-03" facs="d296-03"/>diplomats in Washington. If
                            they do object, it would mean, of course, that we would then be obliged
                            to request withdrawal their personnel in Washington.</p>
                        <p>4. Before proceeding inform <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of our
                            decision, we wish consult with Belgians re procedure and timing. We
                            particularly desire views of Ambassador Van de Kerchove who during last
                            spring Washington consultations on Baghdad property problem welcomed
                            idea of assignment of Americans to Interests Section.</p>
                        <p>5. Embassy, therefore, authorized inform Belgian Government of our desire
                            assign American personnel to Baghdad Interests Section and consult as
                            above. Embassy should indicate in general terms reasons for this
                            decision as given above but without in any way implying any US
                            dissatisfaction with Belgian administration of US Interests Section
                            affairs. In addition, Embassy may inform Belgians that US intends
                            maintain low profile in Baghdad and for that reason we intend keep our

                        <p>In a series of four articles that appeared in Beirut's L'Orient-Le Jour
                            some weeks ago (extracts and summaries are attached), Lebanese
                            journalist Edward Saab set forth a number of interesting and provocative
                            views on the current situation in Iraq. As reported in BEIRUT 10233,
                            Saab appeared convinced that the Ba'thist regime — its internal position
                            strengthened by fortunate economic developments and by its alleged
                            success in defusing the threat of Kurdish, Communist and other domestic
                            opposition — is about to embark on a major effort to expand its
                            influence in the Arab East, especially in the Persian Gulf.</p>

                        <p>We found both the Department's and Embassy Tehran's initial reactions
                            (STATE 213299 and Tehran 6586) to Saab's observations highly useful. We
                            have paid close attention to them in attempting to assess the
                            information and conclusions contained in Saab's reporting. We have also
                            had opportunity to discuss Saab's views with a number of reasonably
                            well-informed observers of Iraqi affairs in Beirut—e.g., Iraqi exiles
                            who maintain close contact with developments at home, our foreign
                            diplomatic colleagues, and western newsmen who attended the National
                            Charter unveiling at Baghdad last November. While their opinions
                            undoubtedly reflect a degree of subjectivity and, in some cases, even
                            self-interest, they tend generally to correspond with the Department's
                            assessment of the situation in Iraq, and they are at variance with
                            Saab's observations in some important respects.</p>
                        <p>One is tempted to conclude that Saab, while essentially accurate on many
                            facts, has built on these facts an analysis which contains unfounded and
                            probably erroneous conclusions about the internal situation in Iraq, the
                            degree of control exercised by the ruling Ba'ath Party, and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s ability to make its influence felt
                            beyond its borders in the months and years ahead. On the other hand,
                            Saab apparently saw an unusually interesting collection of key Iraqi
                            political figures, and his analyses of the complex inter-relationships
                            between the Ba'th, the Communist Party of Iraq (<gloss target="#t_CPI1">CPI</gloss>) and the Kurdish Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>) are revealing — even if his
                            conclusions regarding the future of Iraqi Ba'thism turn out to be
                            erroneous. Saab appears to have assessed accurately the strong Soviet
                            support for the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. His assessment of
                            Iraq's economic potential and development prospects appears reasonably
                            accurate, although (as the Department points out) there are ample
                            precedents for questioning the Central Government's ability to harness
                            them in a comprehensive and effective manner. Finally, Saab's picture of
                            Ba'thist aspirations, both domestic and external, is also interesting —
                            if only as an indication of the regimes capacity for grandiose
                            self-delusion.</p>

                        <p>In the following commentary, we shall try to play devil's advocate with
                            respect to some of Saab's observations and hopefully, by comparing them
                            to our own impressions and those contained in STATE 213299, put them in
                            better perspective. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Political Situation</p>
                        <p>Saab's main thesis — that the Ba'thist regime, its internal position
                            having been made secure by the elimination or neutralization of its
                            domestic opposition, today feels able to assume a stronger role in area
                            affairs — can easily be viewed from the opposite angle. The proclamation
                            of a National Charter and the public invitation to "progressive forces"
                            to participate in the regime's advisory councils, instead of being a
                            sign of the regime's confidence in its secure and undisputed possession
                            of power, could just as well be a sign of insecurity and a frantic
                            attempt to bolster its image at home. Proponents of this letter view
                            contend that, instead of having successfully neutralized domestic
                            opposition, the regime's nervous policies and heavy-handed actions
                            (c.f., Amman 5607) have actually increased and crystallized it to the
                            point where an opportunity exists for any force capable of mobilizing
                            popular hatred and discontent into a broadly-based opposition movement.
                            As noted in Beirut 9689 and reports from Tehran in CAS and State
                            channels, Kurdish leaders seem confident of
                            <persName>Barzani</persName>'s ability to organize such a movement.</p>
                        <p>Saab is not alone in believing that <persName>Barzani</persName>, despite
                            his obvious dissatisfaction with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s performance in implementing the provisions of the March
                            1970 settlement agreement, has seen his influence increasingly eroded by
                            the regime's efforts to develop an economic, if not political, stake for
                            the Kurdish population within the existing system. The respected "an
                            Nahar Arab Report" of January 3 indicated that Bazani and the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>, while they bear no love for the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and would certainly welcome any
                            opportunity to exploit its weaknesses, found it expedient to conclude an
                            interim agreement with Iraqi Foreign Minister Murtada Hadithi in
                            mid-December. In this agreement, the Baghdad authorities <pb n="4" xml:id="d297-04" facs="d297-04"/>reportedly conceded an unspecified
                            number of outstanding issues to the Kurds and, by so doing, went far
                            toward removing what had been the imminent prospect of a Kurdish
                            uprising in the North.</p>
                        <p>It seems true, as Saab says, that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            has implemented those portions of the March 1970 agreement calculated to
                            improve its political, psychological and military position in the
                            Kurdish north. Although we have no way of checking Saab's figures, there
                            appears little doubt that considerable strides have been made in the
                            construction of roads, schools and housing. At the same time, there is
                            nothing (apart from the isolated and cryptic an Nahar report mentioned
                            above) to indicate that the regime has done anything to implement other
                            portions of the agreement, particularly those that provide — albeit in
                            vague terms — for some form of effective political autonomy for the
                            Kurds. (If, only for the record, it should be noted that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reportedly has been paying
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> a regular monthly subsidy of 300,000
                            dinars, and that it did turn over to him those
                                anti-<persName>Barzani</persName> Kurds who supported the regime in
                            the last round of fighting).</p>
                        <p>It seems clear from Saab's contentious interview with
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> that the <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah</persName>, far from being seduced by the material benefits
                            accruing to his people since the March 1970 settlement, is totally
                            intransigent toward and suspicious of the authorities in Baghdad — so
                            much so, in fact, that Saab says the Soviets became alarmed at the tone
                            of some of <persName>Barzani</persName>'s remarks and prevailed on Saab
                            to delete them from the published text. (Even so, newsmen returning from
                            Baghdad have told us that the text as published left the Iraqi
                            Government furious at Saab.) Neither Barzani nor the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> — which, as Saab points out, has tended
                            increasingly to reflect <persName>Barzani</persName>'s influence — seems
                            at all prepared to settle for the mere trappings of an autonomy (i.e.,
                            five "ministerial" positions and participation in a "National Front”)
                            that allows the Ba'thists to retain all the essentials of real political
                            power in their own hands. Our contacts among Iraqi emigres in Beirut who
                            claim to have close ties with Kurdish nationalists assert <pb n="5" xml:id="d297-05" facs="d297-05"/>that the bulk of the Kurdish
                            population shares these sentiments and is more united behind
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> than at any time in the past. If so,
                            the rulers in Baghdad may only be fooling themselves if they believe
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> have been effectively neutralized and in the event of a
                            renewal of Iraqi-Kurdish hostilities, they would not command the support
                            of the Kurdish masses.</p>
                        <p>Saab's estimate that <persName>Barzani</persName>'s forces have been
                            circumscribed or otherwise put at a military disadvantage vis-a-vis the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> also seems questionable. His
                            claim that Iraqi troops now hold many strategic positions in areas never
                            before controlled by the regime is dismissed as nonsense by many of our
                            informants, who make the counter-claim that the exact opposite is true.
                            Not surprisingly, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has attempted
                            to continue its past practice of using Kurds (now grouped in army units
                            officered by Iraqi Arabs) to confront <persName>Barzani</persName>, but
                            he said to remain confident that such mercenaries will melt away when
                            the first shots are fired. In fact, CAS reports already indicate a
                            marked increase in Kurdish desertions from the Iraqi Army. (It is
                            necessary here to recall that, due to the Iraqi Arab soldier's inability
                            to cope with the climate and geography of north Iraq — not to mention
                            with the fighting qualities of the Pesh Merga — the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was forced to employ some 15,000
                                anti-<persName>Barzani</persName> Kurds in the last round of
                            fighting. As noted above, the regime left these mercenaries to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>'s mercy after the March 1970
                            settlement, and memories of this experience may make it unlikely that
                            many Kurds will be eager to cooperate with the regime against
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> if fighting breaks out again.)</p>
                        <p>We note that one guiding principle of Ba'thism, which considers itself an
                            elite movement uniquely qualified to rule, seems always to have been a
                            total unwillingness to share power with any other political force,
                            actual or potential. This may explain why the Iraqi Ba'th insists (as
                            both President <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSSEIN TAKRITI</persName> made clear in
                            November and December 1971) on the complete subordination of the Iraqi
                            military to exclusive party control. Saab describes the Iraqi Army as a
                            docile creature no longer posing a threat to the regime.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d297-06" facs="d297-06"/>
                        <p>If he is right (the regime appears to have been taking no chances at the
                            July 17 military review in Baghdad), this docility — achieved by
                            relentless purges of unreliable elements — may well have cost the army
                            much of whatever effective fighting capacity it once possessed. One of
                            our informants goes so far as to say that the army, in any renewal of
                            hostilities with the Kurds, could not fight its way out of a wet paper
                            bag. He maintains that in such circumstances, the regime could find
                            itself in an impossible dilemma — i.e., faced with having to accept
                            humiliating military reverses that could bring about its co11apse, or
                            having to recall "unreliable" elements to key military positions, from
                            which they could work enthusiastically to undermine the regime from
                            within.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing, Saab's implied contention that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s alleged success in neutralizing
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> argues against its involvement in the
                            recent abortive attempt on his life is not particularly compelling. Even
                            Saab reports <persName>Barzani</persName>'s conviction that the regime
                            engineered that bizarre attempt, since it believes (not without reason)
                            that with his demise, the Kurdish problem would disappear in a welter of
                            conflicting tribal and ideological, differences among his followers.
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> is doubtless aware what seem to have
                            been efforts by the regime to increase the fighting potential of his
                            principal tribal enemies in conjunction with the assassination attempt.
                            We are told that he is also convinced that the Soviets, for reasons of
                            their own, were at least aware of, if not actually behind, the plot to
                            kill him. As a result, he seems even less inclined to trust in Ba'thist
                            and Russian overtures aimed at gaining Kurdish acceptance of the
                            National Charter.</p>
                        <p>The regime's explanation for its recent action in arresting several
                            members of the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> in Baghdad on Charges
                            of "subversive activity" and its more recent expulsions of Kurdish
                            "undesirables" across the Iranian border are hardly likely to render him
                            less suspicious. A January 17 AFP report from Tehran records
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> as having gone so far as to accuse the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="d297-07" facs="d297-07"/>of planning the
                            "extermination of the Kurd/*/" and calling on his followers to resume
                            the fight against Iraq.</p>
                        <p>We therefore find it hard to credit Saab's belief that the internal
                            situation in Iraq will remain quiet long enough to permit the Ba'thist
                            regime to turn its undivided attention to bolstering its political
                            influence abroad. Recent news items from Tehran have already referred to
                            clashes between Iraqi forces and the Kurds in the north, and CAS reports
                            indicate that relations between the two sides are strained, with both
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> convinced that a renewal of hostilities is inevitable.
                            Our British colleagues appear convinced that "something is brewing" that
                            will involve not only a renewal of Kurdish-Iraqi hostilities, but also
                            possibly an alliance between the Kurds and dissident Iraqi Arabs, some
                            of whom have apparently taken refuge with <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            and helped him seek external assistance. We recall that the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>'s Secretary-General, Habib Muhammed
                            Karim, spoke of a coming popular Kurdish-Arab uprising in his November 2
                            meeting with us in Beirut (Beirut 9689 and Subseqnent memmcon).</p>
                        <p>We are hardly in a position to predict the lengths to which the Iranian
                            Government might be prepared to go in order to speed the downfall of an
                            Iraqi regime that, as shown by recent mass expulsions, clashes and
                            growing tension along the Iraqi-Iranian border, seems to delight in
                            provoking and irritating its neighbor to the east. We gather from
                            accounts received from some of our informants (and more or less
                            confirmed by the British) that Iranian support for the Kurds in the last
                            round of fighting was not exactly wholehearted - that, in fact, when a
                            Kurdish coalition with dissident Iraqi Arabs was on the point of being
                            realized in early 1970, it was spoiled by a clumsy Iranian (<gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>) effort to mount a separate coup by
                            anti-Ba'thist elements in Baghdad. The Iranian-backed conspiracy was
                            easily penetrated by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, and the
                            plotters were "rubbed out" in a matter of a few hours. This traumatic
                            experience is said to have cooled the ardor of Iraqi dissidents for
                            further subversive activity, and the Kurds were forced to fight on alone
                            until March 1970. This time around, say our informants, both the
                            Iranians and dissident Iraqis can be expected to profit from 1970's sad
                                <pb n="8" xml:id="d297-08" facs="d297-08"/>experience to make common
                            cause with Barzani and the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p> David Hirst of the “Manchester Guardian” reported recently from Baghdad
                            that the Kurds already tend to view their cause as a rallying point for
                            dissident Iraqi Arabs and can be expected to "present themselves as
                            liberators rescuing Arabs and Kurds alike from 'the beasts in Baghdad'”.
                            While Hirst says the results of <persName>Barzani</persName>'s contacts
                            outside Iraq had been disappointing as of last November, he thinks there
                            may be a better response as Kurdish-Ba'thist tensions continue to rise.
                            One of our own informants contends that <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            search for external political support has already set with some success,
                            particularly in Jordan where King Hussein has promised to urge the Shah
                            to play a more active role in support of a Kurdish-led, anti-Ba'thist
                            uprising in Ireq. (He says that a visit by <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            to Tehran, which was postponed by the assassination of Wasfi Tal, will
                            take place in the near future.) In view of the heightening of tensions
                            along the Iraq-Iranian border, we wonder whether the Shah will require
                            much urging by the GOJ.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Influence in Iraq</p>
                        <p>Saab's estimate that the Soviets, having established themselves in a
                            position of considerable influence in Baghdad, are working assiduously
                            to assure continued domestic tranquility in Iraq seems to be correct.
                            The country is already dependent almost exclusively upon Moscow for
                            arms, and in other respects (economic assistance, for example) the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—perhaps mindful of the
                            mistakes of Russian policy during Kassem's time—appears intent on
                            identifying itself completely with the Ba'thist regime. It would seem
                            that the Soviets are determined not only to protect the gains they have
                            already won, but also to transform those gains into a position of
                            ascendency and paramount influence that could stand Moscow in good stead
                            in the Middle East in years to come. Given Iraq's relative isolation in
                            the Middle East, the ground appears fertile for the furtherance of such
                            ambitions, and the Russians seem bent on making the most of it. A
                            four-day visit by Marshall Grechko in mid-December resulted in an
                            announcement of further Soviet-Iraqi cooperation aimed at "strengthening
                            Iraq's defense <pb n="9" xml:id="d297-09" facs="d297-09"/>capabilities"
                            — a statement that suggests the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will provide Iraq with additional weapons and other forms of military
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have also committed themselves increasingly to support for
                            the Ba'thist regime in the field of economic and technical assistance.
                            Beginning with a large-scale aid agreement concluded with Kassem's
                            Government in 1959, Russian assistance by March 1970 had been
                            responsible — according to the official Iraqi News Agency — for the
                            completion of some 63 "major projects,” including 14 in the industrial
                            field, 9 in agriculture, 5 in communications and 5 training institutes.
                            Russian experts also carried out a number of surveys in sulphur, oil and
                            phosphates, and Soviet assistance since 1965 has played a primary role
                            in the financing, planning and ongoing constriction of the Euphrates
                            dam. In 1969, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> managed to get a
                            firm foothold in Iraq's oil industry by undertaking to help the Iraqi
                            National Oil Company (INOC) develop and exploit oil resources in the
                            southeastern Halfaya region and in the controversial North Rumeila area.
                            Contracts forming part of this agreement included a $70 million Soviet
                            loan (repayable partly in crude oil) for the development of the North
                            Rumelia field and a Soviet pledge to supply INOC with $72 million in oil
                            exploration equipment, along with technical advice as to its use.</p>
                        <p>In August 1970, the Ba'thist regime signed another economic protocol in
                            Moscow for Iraqi-Soviet cooperation in new industrial projects, oil and
                            mineral exploitation, agriculture, irrigation and transportation. Under
                            this agreement, said to entail over 50 million Iraqi dinars, the Soviets
                            were to supply industrial and agricultural equipment, experts and
                            technicians in return for payment largely in the form of
                            nationally-produced crude oil. Also in August 1970, there was
                            established a joint Iraqi-Soviet Economic and Technical Committee,
                            charged with supervising the progress of economic cooperation between
                            the two countries. (It reportedly holds rotative annual meetings in
                            Moscow and Baghdad).</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d297-10" facs="d297-10"/>
                        <p>In April 1971, the Iraqi Government signed a 90 million sterling loan
                            agreement with the Soviets at Baghdad, designed to meet the commitments
                            of Soviet organizations engaged; interalia, in constructing an oil
                            refinery at Mosul and a pipeline between Baghdad and Basra. Other
                            projects covered by the loan included the building of two hydroelectric
                            stations in north Iraq, a phosphate mine in the western desert, a
                            fertilizer plant, and several fishing schemes and dairy facilities. This
                            loan agreement was followed in June by a new Iraqi-Soviet "protocol of
                            cooperation,” the details of which seem not to have been fully
                            disclosed. From tid bits of information released by the Iraqi News
                            Agency, however, we gather that it relates to further Soviet assistance
                            in developing the North Rumeila oil field and establishing the al
                            Tharthar Canal irrigation project. A separate <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-Iraqi irrigation accord was signed last October,
                            committing the Soviets to provide water-drilling machinery and financing
                            for a network of agricultural projects in the Tigris and Euphrates river
                            basins. Under the same accord the Russians have undertaken to assist in
                            the desalination and reclamation of five million dunums of land in
                            central Iraq.</p>
                        <p>This thumbnail sketch of Soviet economic and technical commitments to
                            Iraq only begins to describe the substantial extent to which Soviet and
                            Soviet bloc influence and resources have become an indispensable part of
                            the Ba'thist regime's program for promoting national economic
                            development and achieving an essential degree of internal stability.
                            Exchanges of educational and cultural missions, the provision of Soviet
                            and East European experts in fields ranging from marine biology to
                            petrochemicals, the granting of advanced vocational training
                            opportunities in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Soviet
                            bloc nations — all these also play an important role. Taken together
                            with the heavy Soviet stake in Iraq's economic future, they paint a
                            picture of massive Russian involvement that can hardly fail to be
                            reflected in political terms.</p>
                        <p>While it is correct to say that Ba'thist opposition to a peaceful
                            settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict poses a <pb n="11" xml:id="d297-11" facs="d297-11"/>potential source of difficulty for
                            Soviet-Iraqi (not to mention Soviet-Syrian) relations, this apparent
                            contradiction is not likely to cause problems until a settlement appears
                            imminent. Until then, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can
                            afford to espouse Resolution 242 in Cairo and consolidate its position
                            in Baghdad and Damascus at the same time. In fact, if a peaceful
                            settlement should prove attainable and lead to a weakening of the Soviet
                            presence and influence in Egypt, the Russians might hope to retain the
                            foothold in the Arab world that their support for Ba'thist regimes is
                            winning them in Iraq and Syria. If, on the other hand, Sadat's policies
                            of pursuing a peaceful settlement should be totally discredited, the
                            Soviets could find themselves in a position of increased influence in
                            Iraq (and Syria).</p>
                        <p>A far more important risk for Soviet policy in both Iraq and Syria, in
                            our view, lies in the unpredictability of political developments in
                            those countries. In Iraq, assuming that the present political situation,
                            does not prove stable — i.e., that <persName>Barzani</persName> and his
                            allies (or others) are somehow able to overthrow the Ba'thist regime —
                            the Russians, are likely to find that their policy of identification
                            with the Ba'thists has won them an embarrassing backlash of popular
                            resentment.</p>
                        <p>With the Soviets viewing their support for the Central Government in
                            Baghdad as a vehicle for increasing and consolodating their influence in
                            Iraq, it would seem quite logical for them to be pressing the <gloss target="#t_CPI1">CPI</gloss> and the Kurds to avoid trouble with the
                            Ba'thist regime. As far as the <gloss target="#t_CPI1">CPI</gloss> is
                            concerned, Soviet views would seem to be having the desired effect. We
                            note that the official Ba'thist organ, "al Thawra,” on December 1
                            carried an announcement that the Iraqi Communist Party's Central
                            Committee had decided to endorse the National Charter and participate,
                            at least for the moment, in the system of advisory councils it
                            envisages. Judging from what Saab (and others with whom we have talked)
                            has to say regarding the hate for and suspicions of the regime
                            entertained by many Iraqi communists, this decision could have come only
                            after considerable Party discipline had been exacted by Moscow. We note
                            that <gloss target="#t_CPI1">CPI</gloss> delegates to the recent
                            Lebanese Communist <pb n="12" xml:id="d297-12" facs="d297-12"/>Party
                            Congress at Beirut were united in their criticism of the Baghdad regime.
                            (In contrast, the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> Spokesman at the
                            Congress went so far as to express concern over the "appearance of
                            negative signs" in Kurdish-Iraqi relations and the prospect that this
                            trend could lead to a renewal of fighting in Iraq. He attributed the
                            trend to unnamed "elements who want to check the aspirations of the
                            Kurdish people and blow up the greatest gains of our long years of
                            struggle….”).</p>
                        <p>As for the Kurds, including the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> there
                            may have been a time when Soviet influence was a decisive factor in the
                            deliberations of Kurdish inner councils. (We gather that Russian
                            pressure on <persName>Barzani</persName> had a lot to do with bringing
                            about Kurdish agreement to the March 1970 settlement proposals).
                            However, as mentioned above, <persName>Barzani</persName> is reportedly
                            convinced that the Soviet Union was party to the plot to assassinate him
                            last September. Moreover, the Kurds are not fools—they can read Russian
                            intentions as well as anybody-and they doubtless can see that Soviet
                            influence and support is wholly at the service of their adversaries in
                            Baghdad. We are informed that the Russian Ambassador in Baghdad has
                            visited <persName>Barzani</persName> at least twice in recent months in
                            an attempt to persuade the <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah</persName>
                            to moderate his attitude toward the Ba'thist regime and endorse Kurdish
                            participation in the front envisaged in the National Charter. However,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>, according to our informants, is no
                            longer disposed to pay much attention to Soviet advice. Despite a recent
                            report in pro-Iraqi newspapers in Beirut that he has "approved" the
                            Charter, we have seen nothing to confirm this and are inclined to doubt
                            it. (We have noted reports that the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>
                            organ, "al Taakhi,” was strongly rebuked by the party for having printed
                            an unauthorized editorial praising the Charter effort. "New York Times"
                            reporter Marvin Howe has told us she believes the "al Taakhi" editors
                            are more sympathetic to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> than to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. On the other hand, it is possible that
                            the regime could have brought pressure to bear on the "al Taakhi" staff.
                            We heard in October that two staff members had been arrested by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and that one editor, Guirgis
                            Fathallah, was having qualms about remaining in Baghdad).</p>

                        <p>We do not dispute Saab's assessment of Iraq's considerable economic
                            potential, and his figures regarding the extent to which the Ba'thist
                            regime is beginning to develop the country's abundant natural resources
                            are interesting.</p>
                        <p>Iraqi oil revenues, already given a large boost by the agreement
                            concluded between <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> and the oil
                            companies in February 1971 and by the January 1972 increase of 8.49
                            percent in the posted price to offset the dollar devaluation, can be
                            expected to soar further in the future if the regime's ambitious plans
                            for national oil development are carried through. A ten-year $1.8
                            billion development program, approved by the Revolutionary Command
                            Council in late December, envisages the doubling of national oil
                            production by 1981 through projected annual increases of ten percent
                            over the next decade. The program will finance increases in prospecting,
                            exploration and drilling activity; the expansion of crude oil and gas
                            reserves; the contraction of new pipelines and harbor facilities; and
                            the search for new international consumer markets for Iraqi oil and gas
                            products. It calls for INOC to build a number of pipelines to Gulf and,
                            Mediterranean Ports, as well as a deep-water Gulf terminal to handle
                            giant tankers. (Iraq and Syria have agreed to conduct a survey for a new
                            pipeline to transit Syria, but they have not yet reached agreement on
                            the construction or operation of such a pipeline.) As Saab points out,
                            INOC is also buying seven small (35,000 ton) tankers from Spain (under a
                            barter agreement) for delivery over the next several years, and it has
                            leased additional tankers from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            so as to be in a position to export nationally produced crude oil early
                            in 1972. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has
                            entered into several agreements with foreign countries (e.g. Brazil and
                            North Korea) for marketing relatively small amounts of crude oil.</p>
                        <p>Saab fails to point out that Iraq's ambitious plans for exporting oil
                            produced by INOC depend on its ability to market production from the
                            North Rumeila field, which was in effect <pb n="14" xml:id="d297-14" facs="d297-14"/>confiscated from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            in 1962 under Law 80. With the assistance of the Soviet Union and other
                            Bloc nations, the development of wells, pipelines, and an export
                            terminal at Fao will be completed in the near future, and INOC will be
                            able to export crude oil early in 1972. However, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            controversy over Law 80 remains unsettled, and there is some doubt, in
                            the short-run at least, over INOC's ability to market substantial
                            quantities of such oil. In addition, Saab does not mention the sharp
                            decrease in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> offtake from Iraq's
                            northern fields which began in the second quarter of 1971, and which
                            resulted in a substantial reduction of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>s anticipated revenues. Offtake returned to normal in
                            December 1971, but as <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> exports are
                            directly related to tanker rates which have fluctuated drastically over
                            the past several years, it is not at all certain that offtake will
                            continue at near-capacity levels.</p>
                        <p>Another noteworthy development was the announcement on January 3 of a
                            Chinese-Iraqi trade agreement under which China will import a minimum of
                            100,000 tons of Iraqi sulphur for five years. In addition, according to
                            the Iraqi News Agency, a team of Chinese experts will visit Iraq shortly
                            to study a number of development projects that will be carried out under
                            $40 million loan which China granted to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in an agreement signed at Peking in June 1971.</p>
                        <p>Grandiose plans, of course, are one thing; the ability of a government to
                            implement them effectively and efficiently is quite another. As the
                            Department has observed, Iraqi governments in the past have displayed
                            little understanding of how to exploit the country's resources in a
                            comprehensive and rational manner. We note, in this regard, that the
                            present Iraqi regime seems to have made a point, of reducing its
                            dependence on purely Iraqi expertise by importing more competent
                            technical advice from abroad. This policy may well be a matter of
                            necessity as a result of the exodus from Iraq of "reactionary" elements
                            who were the best educated (Syria has had a similar experience under
                            Ba'thist rule). We wonder to what extent Saab's rosy view of the
                            regime's capacity for coherent economic planning and development was
                            influenced <pb n="15" xml:id="d297-15" facs="d297-15"/>by the presence
                            of foreign advisers, mainly Russians, East Europeans and Algerians, at
                            various levels in government and industry. One can only speculate
                            whether this new reservoir of talent and experience will help the
                            regime's efforts at economic development to produce results appreciably
                            better than those of its predecessors. Saab himself admits that many of
                            the regime's most ambitious projects in the fields of irrigation,
                            agriculture and industry are still in their pilot or experimental
                            stages. In view of Iraq's need for cash to finance military expenditures
                            and help repay its debts to the Soviet Union and other creditors, it
                            remains to be seen how efficiently and rapidly development projects can
                            be implemented on a larger scale in the future.</p>
                        <p>Given proper planning for using its increased revenues, there seems
                            little doubt that with a period of stability and continued prosperity at
                            home, Iraq could be in a position to assert its political influence more
                            heavily in the Gulf and elsewhere in the Arab world. However, the sine
                            qua non — internal stability — seems to us a more fragile flower than
                            Saab is willing to admit. Should it wither, his whole vision of a
                            renascent, aggressive Basthist Iraq exercising a powerful influence on
                            regional politics could collapse like a house of cards. We wonder, in
                            fact, whether the inner dynamics of a minority Ba'thist rule with its
                            regime of fear do not contradict Saab's image of stability and
                            prosperity. The experience of Syria before the Assad regime came to
                            power with a Ba'thist label but a more pragmatic approach provides an
                            illustrative example.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iraqi Influence in the Area</p>
                        <p>We agree with the Department and Tehran that there have been no
                            indications of a significant increase in Iraqi influence in the Arab
                            East or in the Gulf. Saab, however, was engaging in a long-term
                            prediction based upon his thesis of Iraq's internal political stability
                            and considerable economic potential. He is not entirely alone, moreover,
                            in his assessment that the prospect (however illusory) of continued
                            stability is encouraging the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to pay
                            more attention to increasing its <pb n="16" xml:id="d297-16" facs="d297-16"/>political influence abroad. We have seen indications
                            of considerable emphasis being given to Iraqi ambitions in Iran, the
                            Gulf and other Arab states over the next five years, and there is no
                            reason to believe that the blow struck at Iraqi pretensions by Iran's
                            recent seizure of islands in the lower Gulf has discouraged these plans
                            from being carried forward. One fairly convincing indication of Iraq's
                            growing potential for making its weight felt in the Arab world is the
                            attitude of the Syrian Government, which is said to be growing
                            increasingly concerned about the strength of the Iraqi regime and, in
                            response partly to Soviet pressure, has taken some steps toward
                            improving its relations with the rulers in Baghdad. (In addition to the
                            joint oil projects a Syrian delegation was reported to have arrived at
                            Baghdad on December 27 for four days of talks with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on the old and long discussed issue of
                            sharing the waters of the Euphrates, as well as on bilateral trade and
                            transit relations.)</p>
                        <p>In addition, we note that at last month's <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> meeting in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia reversed its
                            long-standing policy of opposing Iraqi membership in <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss>— a development that should lead to
                            Iraq's admission to the organization early this year and enhance its
                            growing position as a voice to be reckoned with in Arab petroleum
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it should be noted that from what we know of Saab's views
                            about the Middle East in general, his predictions are also based on an
                            assumption that efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the
                            Arab-Israeli conflict will not succeed — thereby favoring the
                            harder-line countries such as Iraq over those (such as Egypt) which have
                            been pursuing a more moderate approach. Finally, despite his qualities
                            as a reporter with excellent contacts in many Arab circles, Saab is also
                            wont to give himself over to wishful thinking as to future Arab
                            strength.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. In early March 1972 a reliable Agency source reported that Mulla
                            Mustafa al-<persName>Barzani</persName>, leader of the Iraqi Kurds, was
                            under considerable pressure from the Soviet Union to effect a
                            rapprochement with the Ba'thi regime in Baghdad. Together with this
                            effort, the Soviet Union is also exerting pressure upon the Ba'th Party
                            of Iraq and the Communist Party of Iraq to resolve their differences and
                            work togther toward a national front government. As a result of this
                            pressure, al-<persName>Barzani</persName> believes that both the Iraqi
                            Kurdish movement as well as the Iraqi nation are in danger since he will
                            have to acquiesce unless he receives help from outside Iraq.
                            Consequently, al-<persName>Barzani</persName> is again planning to send
                            an emissary to persuade the United States Government of his concern and
                            to arrange travel to the United States for
                                al-<persName>Barzani</persName> to plead his case personally.
                            Al-Barzani has indicated that he will not sign any agreement with the
                            Ba'th Party of Iraq until he has reassessed the position of the United
                            States toward his cause. (The last meeting between the United States
                            Government and an emissary from al-<persName>Barzani</persName> took
                            place in Beirut in early November 1971, and was reported in confidential
                            Beirut Embtel 9689, 3 November 1971.)</p>
                        <p>On 6 March 1972, a senior official of the Iranian National Intelligence
                            and Security Organization <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>)
                            contacted [text not declassified] to advise that <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> believes that Iraq is falling
                            increasingly under Soviet domination. The <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> official cited Soviet pressures on
                                al-<persName>Barzani</persName> and the imminence of a Soviet-Iraqi
                            treaty. The <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> official stated that
                            these factors presage further Soviet inroads into Iraq with consequent
                            difficulties for Iran and for the Persian Gulf. The <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> official concluded by <pb n="2" xml:id="d299-02" facs="d299-02"/>asking for the latest United States
                            position on the question of attempting to replace the Iraqi Ba'thist
                            government. The <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> official also
                            wished to know if the United States would be prepared to provide
                            financial and military support for the attempt and assist in drawing

                        <p>2. IRAQ AND THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ARE EACH PREPARING
                            A DRAFT VERSION OF THE AGREEMENT. FOR ITS PART, THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> HAS SET FOUR PRECONDITIONS TO THE
                            CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT:</p>
                        <p>A. FORMATION OF A UNITED FRONT GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ IN WHICH THE COMMUNIST
                            PARTY OF IRAQ WOULD PARTICIPATE;</p>
                        <p>B. PROVISION OF FACILITIES FOR THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            NAVY AT IRAQI PORTS, IN RETURN FOR SOVIET TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE

                        <p>C. CONSULTATION BETWEEN IRAQ AND THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> IN CASE OF A DISPUTE INVOLVING EITHER COUNTRY AND A
                            THIRD PARTY; AND</p>

                            A TIME WHEN PART OF SYRIA IS OCCUPIED BY ISRAELI FORCES. AL-BAKR'S VIEW

                            urged that we provide assistance through [<hi rend="italic">text not

                                al-<persName>Barzani</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Similar approaches have been made over the last ten years and have been
                            turned down. The British have also avoided involvement. The Israelis are
                            probably paying <persName>Barzani</persName> a sizeable monthly subsidy,
                            and King Hussein when he comes here may support US involvement. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>According to a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report, the Soviets
                            have urged <persName>Barzani</persName> and the Kurds to join a national
                            front government in Iraq which would include Communists, Nasirists and
                            Kurds under the Ba'th Party of Iraq. As you may know, the Kurds have
                            been relatively quiet for the last two years or so. The purpose of any
                            move the Iranians supported now would be to try again to overthrow the
                            Iraqi Ba'thist government and to reduce chances of Soviet entrenchement
                            in Iraq. There are reports that a Soviet treaty with Iraq similar to
                            that one with Egypt is in the offing.</p>
                        <p>State Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are inclined to
                            continue to avoid involvement. For one thing, any assistance that may be
                            needed by <persName>Barzani</persName> is fully within the capability of
                            Iran or Israel to provide. There is nothing absolutely needed from us
                            except that they want to involve us. Another factor is that the odds are
                            against the Kurds succeeding. Also, our involving ourselves for the
                            first time at this point could be regarded by the Soviets as a move
                            directed against them.</p>
                        <p>My instinct is to remain out of this as we have in the past, but I felt
                            that you ought to be aware because of the Soviet angle.</p>

                        <p>Following the visit of SADDAM TAQRITI to Moscow in February 1972, the
                            Iraqi Ba'ath Government approached the Kurdish leadership asking it to
                            sign the "National Covenant”. A few days later, on 28 February, a Soviet
                            delegation of four persons arrived at the Hqs of MULLA MUSTAPHA BARZANI.
                            The appearance of the group was an unusual and extraordinary event and
                            is regarded to be of significance.</p>

                        <p>They made the following proposals:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Kurds should sign the National Covenant and join the Popular
                            Front, led by the Ba'ath Party. The Communists will be joining the
                            Covenant.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Soviets will establish a liaison with the Kurds. A Soviet mission
                            with W/T contact will be stationed at <persName>Barzani</persName>'s Hqs
                            with the task of maintaining contact and "protecting"
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>.</p>

                        <p>(3) <persName>Barzani</persName> was invited to visit the Soviet Union
                            and assurances were given for his safe passage.</p>
                        <p>(4) <persName>Barzani</persName> was promised Soviet support should he go
                            along with the above proposals.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Iraqi-Soviet move is of considerable geopolitical
                            significance. Possibly the purpose of this move is to free the Iraqi
                            forces for military-political action in the Persian Gulf, to be directed
                            also against the oil interests in that area.</p>

                            sent an emissary during March 1972 to approach Jordanian [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and United States
                            Governments for aid, and to inviter former Iraqi Prime Minister General
                            'Abd al-Razzaq al-NAYIF to participate in an Arab-Kurdish Government in
                            the North. The emmissary said that al-<persName>Barzani</persName>
                            believes that the West will not wish to overlook recent signs of
                            strengthening Soviet-Iraqi relations. During his talks in the West, the
                            emissary hopes to receive a favorable response to some or all of the
                            following requirements:</p>
                        <p>A. Political discussions on a continuing basis;<lb/> B. Provision of

                            training for its operator;<lb/> D. Cooperation with Kurdish intelligence
                            which is the responsibility of Mas'ud <persName>Barzani</persName>;
                            and<lb/> E. The award of some scholarships for Kurds to study at western
                            universities. END OF SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. During March 1972 Mulla Mustafa al-<persName>Barzani</persName> sent
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] as his special
                            representative, to have discussions <pb n="2" xml:id="d302-02" facs="d302-02"/>with [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            representatives of the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            and United States Governments.</p>
                        <p>2. During meetings with [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            explained recent developments in Iraq, including the forthcoming
                            signature of a Soviet-Iraqi treaty of friendship agreed upon in
                            principle during the visit of <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSAYN
                                AL</persName>-<persName>Tikriti</persName>, Vice-President of the
                            Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) and Assistant Secretary-General of the Ba'th Party of
                            Iraq, to Moscow in February; Soviet pressure on the Kurds to sign the
                            national charter with the Iraqi Ba'th Party and the Iraqi Communist
                            Party; and the implications for the area as a whole of these
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>3.[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] said that these
                            developments placed the Kurds in a corner. If they agreed to join the
                            national charter with the Iraqi Communist Party and the Ba'th, it would
                            be impossible to escape at a later date, especially with the degree of
                            support currently being pressed by the Soviet Union on the Ba'thi
                            Government in Baghdad. If the Kurds refuse to join they must face the
                            prospect of a renewal of hostilities. While the Soviet Union was
                            pressing the Kurds to join, the Iranians were making every effort to
                            persuade them not to. The Iranians had asked Idris
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>,the son of Mulla Mustafa, to send them
                            a list of requirements of their current military and material needs.
                            This had been done and accepted in principle by the Iranians. The
                            Kurds,however, did not trust the Iranians to implement their promises of
                            help.</p>
                        <p>4.[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] continued by saying that
                            the Kurds were no longer thinking in purely Kurdish terms but had
                            discussed recent developments as a national problem for Iraq. In
                            addition, the coming signature of a Soviet-Iraqi treaty had strategic
                            implications for the whole area. In an effort to deal with the problem
                            in its national context, the Kurds had had contact with Arab exile roups
                            living in Cairo, but they did not trust them. [<hi rend="italic">text
                                not declassified</hi>] suggested that if [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] believed that the right moment had come, he
                            personally should participate in the formation of a joint Arab-Kurdish
                            committee located in Kurdistan, which would adopt the slogan of the
                            Iraqi revolution in the north. The committee should establish
                            international contacts throughout the world and then form a national
                            government <pb n="3" xml:id="d302-03" facs="d302-03"/>in the north after
                            preparing the constitutional basis of a new regime. It should then seek
                            the cooperation of the Iraqi Army and expel the Beth from Baghdad. The
                            Arab-Kurdish committee should make it clear to Iran that, while
                            accepting their military and other material assistance, they would not
                            welcome direct control or intervention by Iran in Iraqi internal
                            affairs. Long Kurdish experience in working with Iran left no doubt that
                            Iranian policy was to establish a weak government in Baghdad under
                            unsuitable leaders wuch as 'Abd al-Ghany al-Rawi.</p>
                        <p>5.[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] said that if anything
                            was to be done, a start would have to be made during the next three
                            months. He proposed to visit [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] who had earlier promised to intercede with the
                            Shah of Iran to provide necessary military aid without insisting on
                            direct Iranian intervention and control of events. In addition,[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] said he was hoping to have
                            discussions with officials at a senior level in[text not declassified]
                            Washington to explain to them the strategic implications of recent
                            Soviet moves in Iraq and to ask for some modest measures of help for the
                            Kurds to be given in conditions of complete secrecy.</p>
                        <p>6. While realizing that Western policy toward the Kurds had traditionally
                            been one of non-intervention,[<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] said that the Kurds could not believe that the

                        <p>1. According to [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Kurdish
                            leaders believe the visit of <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSAYN
                                AL</persName>-<persName>Tikriti</persName>, Assistant
                            Secretary-General of the Ba'th Party of Iraq (<gloss target="#t_BPI1">BPI</gloss>) and Vice-President of the Revolutionary Command
                            Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>), to Moscow in mid-February
                            1972 opened a new phase of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the
                            Ba'th Party Government in Baghdad. Kurdish representatives in Baghdad
                            reported the favorable comments of senior Iraqi officers on the military
                            assistance agreement signed in Moscow during Saddam Husayn's visit,
                            which involved the further supply of sea mines, torpedo boats, tanks,
                            and the promise of eventual supply of MIG-23 aircraft (sic).
                            (Headquarters Comment: Source did not further identify the type of
                            aircraft promised by the Soviets. Arabs frequently use the designation
                            “MIG-23" when referring to the "Foxbat" aircraft.)</p>
                        <p>2. The Kurds have learned that Soviet officers are already advising on
                            the establishment of a <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> defensive
                            system at Shu'aybah. Of more importance in Kurdish opinion, however, is
                            the offer made by Saddam Husayn to the Soviet Union to nationalize all
                            foreign oil installations in Iraq and to invite Soviet leaders to visit
                            Baghdad, an invitation which was accepted in principle. The Kurds
                            understand that a visit by the General Secretary of the Communist Party
                            of the Soviet Union, <pb n="2" xml:id="d303-02" facs="d303-02"/> Leonid
                            A. Brezhnev,or Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin is likely to take place in
                            April 1972, during which time Iraq will sign with the Soviet Union a
                            friendship treaty modeled on the Egyptian-Soviet friendship treaty
                            signed in May 1971.</p>
                        <p>3. The only condition stipulated by the Soviet Union for full backing for
                            the Ba'th Government in Baghdad is the successful conclusion and
                            signature of a national charter (Al-Mithaq al-Watani) by the <gloss target="#t_BPI1">BPI</gloss>, the Communist Party of Iraq (<gloss target="#t_CPI1">CPI</gloss>), and the Kurdish Democratic Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>). The signature of the national
                            charter would be followed by a cabinet reshuffle bringing Communist
                            ministers into the cabinet alongside the existing Kurdish ministers.</p>
                        <p>4. Direct pressure was exerted on the Kurds by a Soviet delegation which
                            visited Kurdistan in late February 1972 for one night and included a
                            member or alternate member of the Soviet Party Central Committee and
                            representatives of the Soviet Embassy in Baghdad, including an
                            intelligence officer. (Headquarters Comment: Other reporting has
                            identified this CPSU representative as V. P. Rumyantsev, head of the
                            Arab or Middle East Sektor of the International Department of the CC
                            CPSU [but not himself a member or candidate member of the CC CPSU].)
                            During discussions with the Soviet delegation, <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> leader Mulla Mustafa al-<persName>Barzani</persName>
                            attacked the record of <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSAYN
                                AL</persName>-<persName>Tikriti</persName> and the Ba'th Government
                            very strongly. He made it clear to the Soviet visitors that Kurdish
                            experience in dealing with the Ba'th, leading up to the abortive
                            assassination attempt against al-<persName>Barzani</persName> on 27
                            September 1971, prevented the Kurds from trusting the Ba'th.
                                Al-<persName>Barzani</persName> pointed out that the Kurds had
                            developed good relations with Iran and intended to retain them. The
                            Soviet visitors replied that the Kurds should gradually reduce their
                            dependence on Iran when they gradually gained confidence in the Bath,
                            after signing the national charter. They offered to send a Soviet
                            liaison officer to remain permanently at
                            al-<persName>Barzani</persName>'s headquarters and to guarantee
                                al-<persName>Barzani</persName>'s safety.</p>
                        <p>5. After the Soviet delegation left, Kurdish representatives in Baghdad,
                            including Muhammad Mahmud Abd-al-Rahman (aka Sami), Minister of State
                            Salih al-Yusufi, Nuri Shawish (pro-Moscow), Dara Tawfiq (a Communist),
                            Minister of Municipalities Ihsan Shirzad, and Minister of Agriculture
                            Nafidh Jalal, were summoned to the north. Of these, only Sami is trusted
                            by the ruling Kurdish <pb n="3" xml:id="d303-03" facs="d303-03"/>group
                            around al-<persName>Barzani</persName>: his sons Idris and Masud
                            Barzani, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_UM2">Mahmud 'Uthman</persName>, and
                            Habib 'Abd-al-Karim. The Baghdad Kurds tendered the advice that the
                            Ba'th was offering a lot and that the Kurds had their own faults,
                            particularly their reliance on Iran. They suggested that the Ba'th was
                            sincere in wanting to negotiate a national pact. In reply,
                                al-<persName>Barzani</persName> again violently attacked the Ba'th
                            and refused to listen to their arguments. Nevertheless, a committee was
                            formed consisting of Salih al-Yusufi, Dara Tawfiq and Muhammad Mahmud
                            Abd-al-Rahman to negotiate with the Ba'th. The committee was immediately
                            given a brief to demand the most difficult conditions in their
                            negotiations with the Ba'th with a view to bringing about a delay,
                            forestalling a quick agreement, and allowing the Kurds time to study the
                            situation. These conditions included:</p>
                        <p>A. A demand for immediate local autonomy for the Kurdish areas as laid
                            down in the 11 March 1970 agreement;</p>
                        <p>B. A demand for the Kirkuk area to be made over to the Kurds; and</p>
                        <p>C. A demand that two-fifths of the revenue of Iraq should be spent in the
                            Kurdish areas in proportion to the Kurdish population.</p>
                        <p>6. Kurdish leaders are well aware that the Ba'th will not accept these
                            conditions but fear that for tactical reasons they will propose to sign
                            an agreement incorporating them, later refusing to implement the agreed
                            conditions. The Kurds believe that the Ba'th will take every opportunity
                            to instigate plots against them, buy off Kurds whose loyalty is divided,
                            and try to isolate and weaken al-<persName>Barzani</persName> with a
                            view either to assassinate him or fight him when he has been
                            sufficiently weakened. AlBarzani is hesitating to take a decision to
                            move openly against the Ba'th, since he fears that the Soviet Union
                            would turn against him. The Soviet Union has openly said that it will
                            oppose any elements working against the Ba'th. Al-Barzani believes that
                            the small amount of aid received from Iran during recent months makes
                            fighting impossible at present.</p>
                        <p>7. If an Iraqi government in exile, consisting of Kurds and Arabs,
                            however, could be established in the north, backed by other outside
                            groups, there would be a good hope of <pb n="4" xml:id="d303-04" facs="d303-04"/>destroying the Ba'th. If help did not become
                            available, the Kurds believe that the increasing willingness of the
                            Soviet Union to throw its weight behind the Ba'th eventually will
                            undermine their ability to adopt an independent stance and will open the
                            way to the Ba'th controlling the whole area of Iraq.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Attached, is a memorandum of the Uthman-<persName corresp="#p_STJ1">Scotes</persName> conversation. Uthman made an appeal for direct or
                            indirect U.S. assistance to enable <persName>Barzani</persName> to
                            establish an Iraqi Arab-Kurdish "liberation movement" in Iraqi Kurdistan
                            with the aim of overthrowing the Ba'athi regime in Baghdad. He also
                            transmitted a letter to the Secretary (see attached rough translation)
                            in which <persName>Barzani</persName> makes the same appeal. He has
                            requested an answer to this appeal by Thursday, April 6.</p>
                        <p>Our initial reaction to this appeal is negative based on our views that
                            (a) a <persName>Barzani</persName>-dominated regime would have
                            difficulty surviving in the face of what would doubtless become
                            consolidated Arab opposition to it from both inside and outside Iraq;
                            (b) the Soviets are so well established economically in Iraq that even
                            if <persName>Barzani</persName> succeeds in overthrowing the Ba'athis,
                            it is unlikely that he could break Iraq's ties with Moscow unless we
                            were prepared to step in with immediate and perhaps large-scale
                            assistance; (c) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support for a coup
                            operation which at best appears to be ill organized would be difficult
                            "to conceal and thus the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would risk
                            further strains on its relations with the other Arab states because of
                            support for a non-Arab movement backed by other non-Arab states (Iran
                            and Israel) against "the Arabs”; (d) facilitating the coming to power of
                            a Kurdish-supported government in Baghdad also risks arousing the
                            expectations of Kurds in neighboring Iran and Turkey, thus
                            causing-concern in at least Turkey if not Iran; (e) any encouragement to
                            the Kurds can only give further impetus to Kurdish nationalist
                            aspirations which aim eventually to establish a separate state of
                            Kurdistan, a step which would be retrogressive in that it would
                            represent further fragmentation in an already fragmented area.</p>
                        <p>Despite the above initial reaction, we have discussed this matter with
                            Roy who agrees that it would be useful if we had an informal review of
                            the Kurdish situation with Mike Waller of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> before making any final decision regarding the Uthman
                            appeal. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has also been getting
                            through independent sources the same information and similar appeals.
                            Such a review would be in line with your thoughts expressed to Tom
                            Scotes at the <pb n="2" xml:id="d304-02" facs="d304-02"/>airport
                            yesterday that we continue to update our assessments and not be guided
                            solely by conventional wisdom concerning such matters.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we would recommend that you brief the Secretary orally about
                            this problem in view of the fact that the letter from
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> is addressed to him.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>During an April 3 meeting arranged at his request Zayd Uthman, Special
                            Emissary from Kurdish leader Mulla Mustafa Barzani, made the following
                            points to Iraqi Desk Officer <persName corresp="#p_STJ1">Thomas J.
                                Scotes</persName>:</p>
                        <p>a) As a result of the recent visit to Moscow by <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSAYN
                                AL</persName>-<persName>Tikriti</persName>, Assistant Secretary
                            General of the Iraqi Ba'th Party, Soviet influence in Iraq has been
                            dramatically enhanced.</p>
                        <p>b) The Soviets are now pressing Mulla Mustafa to join the Iraqi Ba'th
                            party and the Iraqi Communist Party in the formation of a national front
                            government as part of a Soviet effort to consolidate their position in
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p>c) Mulla Mustafa does not wish to participate in a national front
                            government because he fears that the Ba'th Party will use this proposal
                            as a ploy to destroy the Kurdish Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>d) Mulla Mustafa Barzani appeals to the U.S. Government for financial and
                            military assistance to enable him to establish in Iraqi Kurdistan an
                            Iraqi government-in- exile consisting of Kurds and Arabs, as a
                            stepping-stone leading to the overthrow of the Iraqi Ba'th Party.</p>
                        <p>e) U.S. assistance can be made available to <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            directly or indirectly for example through King Hussein. If it is not
                            furnished in the near future, Mulla Mustafa will <pb n="4" xml:id="d304-04" facs="d304-04"/>not be able to withstand the Soviet
                            and Ba'th pressures which in turn will result in the eventual
                            Sovietization of Iraq thereby threatening Free World interests in the
                            Persian Gulf as well as Iran and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>f) Uthman conveyed a letter in Arabic from <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> in which
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> makes the same appeal as above. Uthman
                            requested an answer to this appeal before his departure from Washington
                            in April 6.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName>Barzani</persName> Plea for U.S. Assistance. Uthman stated
                            that he is coming on a special mission from Mulla Mustafa Barzani to the
                            United States to seek U.S. assistance at a critical time in the history
                            of Iraq and of the Kurdish national movement. Uthman continued that as a
                            result of the recent trip to Moscow by <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">Saddam Hussein Tikriti</persName>, Assistant Secretary General of
                            the Iraqi Ba'th Party, the Soviets are now supporting the Iraqi Ba'th
                            Party's effort to establish a national front government in Iraq. This
                            Soviet support has taken the form of Soviet pressure on Mulla Mustafa
                            Barzani to accede to the Ba'thist request. A high-ranking Soviet
                            Communist Party official was recently in Kurdistan trying to persuade
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. <persName>Barzani</persName>, however,
                            feels that if the Kurdish Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>) joins with the Iraqi Ba'th Party and the Iraqi
                            Communist Party, the Kurdish national movement will in time be subverted
                            and its force dissipated. Uthman explained that the Soviets aim through
                            their support of a national front stratagem to establish and consolidate
                            further their position in Iraq, particularly at a time when their
                            position in Egypt and Syria seems to be unpredictable. Uthman continued
                            that Soviet economic and political interests in Iraq have grown
                            dramatically over the last several years, and the Soviets wish to
                            protect this investment. Moreover, the Kurds believe that the Soviets
                            intend to use Iraq for subversion not only in the Gulf but against Iran
                            and Turkey as well. Uthman concluded that the stakes are high and that
                            only the U.S. can, by supporting <persName>Barzani</persName> either
                            directly or indirectly, stem the Soviet tide In response to my question,
                            Uthman stated that the Kurds have been in touch with both the Shah and
                            King Hussein. The former, however, blows hot and cola-in his support of
                            the Kurdish national movement. <persName>Barzani</persName> cannot
                            commit himself to an all-out struggle against the Ba'th regime in
                            Baghdad on the basis of such unpredictable support. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, sympathetic though he may be,
                            has been unable to promise the Kurds anything but moral support. He has
                            expressed, however, his willingness to go to Tehran to solicit further
                            assistance from the Shah. <persName>Barzani</persName> can wait no
                            longer for either the Shah or King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. The Soviets and the Iraqi Ba'th leadership are
                            pressing him for an answer in the next three or four <pb n="5" xml:id="d304-05" facs="d304-05"/>weeks. It is for this reason that
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> decided to send a letter (see attached
                            rough English translation) to the Secretary of State in which he makes a
                            final appeal to the U.S. for help. If this help is not forthcoming,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> will be obliged to join the national
                            front, and the West's last opportunity to thwart Soviet designs in Iraq
                            will have been lost.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName>Barzani</persName> Plan. Uthman then explained how
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> intends to proceed if U.S. assistance
                            is forthcoming. Uthman noted at the outset that the U.S. might wish to
                            make its assistance available to the Kurds indirectly as for example,
                            through King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. This would
                            be acceptable to the Kurds, who in any event trust King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. Uthman continued that he, on
                            behalf of <persName>Barzani</persName>, has been in touch with
                            "reputable" Iraqi elements who are opposed to the Ba'thists and who are
                            prepared to cooperate with the Kurds in an attempt to overthrow the
                            Ba'th regime. These Arab elements, however, will make no overt
                            commitment to support <persName>Barzani</persName> until they are
                            assured of U.S. support, both moral and financial. Uthman repeated
                            several times that once U.S. support becomes known,these elements will
                            flock to <persName>Barzani</persName> in the north which will then be
                            used as a center from which to launch initially a propaganda attack
                            against the Ba'thist regime to be followed by whatever military action
                            is required. In response to questions, Uthman was unwilling to be
                            specific concerning military actions, saying that details would be
                            worked out later. Uthman was certain that in view of the strong
                            antipathy toward the Ba'thist regime in Iraq, both the Iraqi Army and
                            the Iraqi people will welcome the establishment of a "liberation"
                            movement located in the north. Uthman indicated that the Kurds have
                            already been in touch with disaffected elements in the Iraqi Army which
                            are only, waiting for the signal to come over to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. Of course, Uthman continued,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> must be in a position to pay these men
                            their salaries as well as to maintain their families if and when they
                            defect. This financial support would be in addition to the current
                            financial support which <persName>Barzani</persName> must make to his
                            own Kurdish irregulars (Pishmerga). At the present time the Iraqi regime
                            pays <persName>Barzani</persName> approximately 150,000 Iraqi Dinars
                            (about $420,000) a month to support the Kurdish irregulars. If
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> refuses to go into the national front,
                            Uthman continued, it was likely the Iraqi Government will cut off this
                            payment, thereby leaving <persName>Barzani</persName> with no money to
                            support his troops (in this regard Uthman observed that there are now
                            approximately some 24,000 Pishmerga either under arms or able to
                            mobilize within 24 hours. Uthman added that if funds become available,
                            the Kurds can raise approximately 50,000 men in the north in a few
                            months time.) Uthman said that <persName>Barzani</persName> would also
                            need "offensive" weapons to supplement the "defensive" weapons which the
                            Kurds now possess.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d304-06" facs="d304-06"/>
                        <p>3. Ba'ath Demands of <persName>Barzani</persName>. Uthman said that as
                            part of <persName>Barzani</persName>'s willingness to participate in a
                            national front government, the Iraqis expect
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> to close his part of the border with
                            Iran and permit the stationing of Iraqi troops in the north.
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> is unwilling to accept these proposals.
                            The Soviets have been endeavoring to ease <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            apprehensions by expressing their willingness to send a high-level
                            Soviet official to stay in the north with <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            to assure that the Iraqi Ba'athists would keep their part of the
                            agreement which would involve ostensibly the granting of autonomy to the
                            north. <persName>Barzani</persName> does not trust either the Soviets or
                            the Ba'athists.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet Aims. Uthman repeated several times his assessment of Soviet
                            aims in Iraq and in the area. As mentioned above, Uthman stated that
                            initially the Soviets wished to protect their major economic and
                            political investment in Iraq. In this connection, Uthman opined that the
                            Soviets may also have their eyes on Iraqi oil. He said that the Kurds
                            have heard from a reliable source that Saddam Husayn has sought Soviet
                            views and assistance in connection with the possible nationalization of
                            the British and American shares of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> consortium. Uthman continued that the longterm goal of
                            the Soviets in Iraq is to use it as a center by which to outflank Turkey
                            and thereby <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, as well as to subvert
                            Iran and the Persian Gulf. Uthman said that the Soviets are already
                            helping the Iraqis put up a missle defense system at Shu'aybah Air Base
                            near Basra. Soviet military advisors are also widespread in the Iraqi
                            Army.</p>
                        <p>5. Past Iranian Involvement. Although expressing Kurdish appreciation for
                            Iranian assistance in the past, Uthman opined that the Iranians either
                            do not know how to deal with Iraqis or are using the Iraqi situation for
                            their own ends. He inclined to the latter view, noting that the Iranians
                            have tried to prevent the Kurds from seeking to make contacts with other
                            possible sources of assistance such as the Uthman stated his view that
                            the Iranians are short-sighted if they believe that they can use the
                            Kurds and the other moderate Iraqis in this manner. Uthman opined that
                            continued instability in Iraq should not be an Iranian goal, as it now
                            appears to be.</p>
                        <p>6. Egyptian Approach to <persName>Barzani</persName>. Uthman said that
                            recently Egypt sent some emissaries to <persName>Barzani</persName> who
                            expressed Syrian and Egyptian interest in cooperating with the Kurds for
                            the purpose of overthrowing the Ba'athist regime in Baghdad. The
                            Egyptians, however, indicated that it would be necessary for the Kurds
                            to cooperate with Arab "nationalist" elements which
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> is not prepared to do because of his
                            belief that these elements are generally discredited among the Iraqi
                            people. <pb n="7" xml:id="d304-07" facs="d304-07"/>Situation in the
                            North. According to Uthman, the situation in the north is quiet. Despite
                            reports of central government assistance to the Kurds, Uthman alleged
                            that very little has in fact been accomplished. This is one reason why
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> has become disillusioned with the
                            Ba'athist regime and its promises. In addition, of course, the recent
                            assassination attempt on <persName>Barzani</persName>'s life did little
                            to enhance the credibility of the Ba'athist regime among the Kurds.
                            Although Arab settlers have been leaving the Arbil area, the Baghdad
                            Government is continuing to bring Arab settlers into the Kirbuk region
                            in an obvious effort to Arabize that area before any plebiscite is held.
                                (<persName>Barzani</persName> doubted that such a plebiscite would
                            ever be held.) Meanwhile, <persName>Barzani</persName>'s prestige among
                            the Kurds has never been higher. Almost all of the tribes now support
                            him including such traditional <persName>Barzani</persName> tribal
                            rivals as the Lolans, the Harkis and the greater part of the Zibaris. In
                            addition, the Jalal Talabani faction of the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> is now completely behind <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            with Talabani and Ibrahim Ahmed in the north at
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>'s headquarters.</p>
                        <p>Situation in Baghdad. Uthman described the situation in Baghdad as one of
                            growing opposition to the regime. He added, however, that the terror
                            employed by the Ba'athists has cowed most of the population. Be said
                            that the torture being used in Iraqi prisons is much worse than any of
                            the Communist regimes have ever used in the past. In this regard, he
                            said that the East Germans are reportedly training the Iraqi secret
                            police. Uthman reiterated the readiness of the Iraqi Arab population to
                            support any movement which would lead to the overthrow of the Ba'athist
                            regime. He qualified this, however, by saying that the Iraqi Arabs would
                            not support "old regime" elements or "sloganeering" Arab
                            nationalists.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On April 9 the Soviet Union and Iraq signed in Baghdad a fifteen-year
                            "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation.” The Treaty, signed on behalf of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, pledges the two countries to
                            cooperate in the political, economic, scientific and military fields,
                            but the commitments are even less specific than the general pledges
                            contained in the Soviet-Egyptian Treaty of May 1971. For example, the
                            article calling for developing "cooperation in the field of
                            strengthening the defensive capabilities of each" is less forthcoming
                            than the undertakings agreed upon last May between the Soviet Union and
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Arab-Israeli problem, the only Soviet concession to Iraqi
                            sensibilities was the assertion that the two parties "will continue to
                            wage unrelenting struggle against imperialism and Zionism.” On the other
                            hand, Iraq, which so far has rejected Security Council Resolution 242,
                            moved closer to accepting the principle of a negotiated Middle East
                            settlement; it agreed to preambular language which stated that both
                            parties were, "Firmly convinced that in the contemporary world
                            international problems must be solved by cooperation and by seeking
                            solutions acceptable to the parties concerned…” For the Iraqi Ba'athis,
                            this is moderate language.</p>
                        <p>The Iraqi-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> treaty symbolizes recent
                            Soviet advances in the area and reflects the considerable and increasing
                            Soviet presence in Iraq. This presence, which complements the Soviet
                            position in Egypt, has been in the form of strong political ties,
                            continuing military assistance and large-scale Soviet economic
                            assistance. In the latter respect <pb n="2" xml:id="d305-02" facs="d305-02"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s participation in
                            ceremonies marking the start of production in the rich North Rumaila oil
                            field reflects the special Soviet effort to gain influence over much of
                            the Iraqi oil complex in order to assure the Soviets of alternative
                            sources of oil for their markets in Western and Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>While BREZHNEV made pact signing a part of his program announced at the
                            24th Soviet Party Congress in March of 1971 and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has recently signed treaties with
                            Egypt and India, it appears that Iraq instigated treaty discussions.
                            Saddam Husseini, the strong man of Iraq, has alienated important
                            segments of the Iraqi body politic and to a great extent has been
                            isolated from the Arab mainstream. In signing a treaty with the Soviets
                            he has sought to enhance the legitimacy of his position and has served
                            notice to his opponents that he has formalized outside support. From the
                            Soviet viewpoint, the Treaty fits into a series of recent moves to
                            consolidate and demonstrate their position in the Arab world,
                            undoubtedly taken with at least one eye on the forthcoming Moscow
                            Summit.</p>
                        <p>Kosygin has emphasized that the treaty is not aimed at another country.
                            In so doing <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> no doubt
                            intended to reassure Iran about Soviet intentions, for ideally the
                            Soviets would like to improve relations with both Baghdad and Tehran
                            simultaneously. In fact they have reached a situation, in the light of
                            Iraqi-Iranian rivalry, where it is difficult to improve relations with
                            one without adversely affecting relations with the other. It is possible
                            that the Soviets will endeavor to overcome this difficulty by seeking to
                            persuade the Iranians that the Treaty in fact will enable the Soviets to
                            persuade the Iraqis to exercise restraint vis-a-vis Iran. However, the
                            Treaty will put a strain on the Soviet-Iranian relationship, which has
                            been fairly good recently. The Shah will see the Treaty as another major
                            Soviet achievement and as confirmation of his fears about long-term
                            Soviet intentions in the area.</p>

                            IN PERSIAN GULF AND US POLICY THERE.</p>
                        <p>1. IRAQ: FRENCH EMBASSY COUNSELOR LOPINOT CALLED ON DEPASSTSEC <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> APRIL 18 FOR REVIEW OF SITUATION
                            IN IRAQ AND PERSIAN GULF. LOPINOT NOTED IRAQI STRONGMAN <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSSEIN</persName> WOULD SOON VISIT PARIS
                            AND QUAI EAGER FOR US ASSESSMENT SIGNIFICANCE RECENT IRAQI-SOVIET
                            TREATY. NOTING US PRESENTLY UNCERTAIN WHETHER SOVIETS OR IRAQIS
                            EXERCISED THE MOST INITIATIVE IN BRINGING OFF TREATY AND REFERRING TO
                            BREZHNEV'S 24TH CONGRESS INDICATION GENERAL SOVIET INTEREST IN SIGNING
                            PACTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> GAVE LOPINOT ASSESSMENT ALONG LINES REFTEL.
                            DAVIES NOTED SPECULATION THAT TREATY MAY IN SOME WAY REFLECT
                            SOVIET-IRAQI DESIRE TO GAIN INFLUENCE IN THE PERSIAN GULF, BUT SAID IT
                            DOUBTFUL IRAQ IN PRESENT STATE OF POLITICAL STABILITY PROVIDES
                            SUFFICIENT BASE FOR SUCH AN UNDERTAKING. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> ALSO POINTED OUT TREATY LESS SPECIFIC IN MILITARY
                            FIELD THAN WAS EARLIER TREATY WITH EGYPT. IN SUMMARY, DAVIES SAID THAT
                            MAIN IMPORTANCE OF TREATY MAY BE SYMBOLIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL. IN RESPONSE
                            TO QUESTION LOPINOT SAID FRENCH, WHILE STILL EVALUATING TREATY <pb n="2" xml:id="d306-02" facs="d306-02"/>DEVELOPMENT, ARE LOOKING AT SAME
                            CONSIDERATIONS <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> HAD
                            OUTLINED.</p>
                        <p>2. LOPINOT NOTED SADDAM'S STRONG INTERNAL POSITION IN IRAQI POWER
                            STRUCTURE BUT AGREED THAT OVERALL POLITICAL STRUCTURE IRAQI IS WEAK AND
                            THAT ARMY, DECIMATED BY BAATHIST PURGES, RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> NOTED KURDISH PROBLEM
                            ALSO WEAKENS EFFECTIVENESS IRAQI REGIME. LOPINOT SAID HE UNDERSTOOD
                            THERE IS "PERSONAL AGREEMENT" BETWEEN <persName>BARZANI</persName> AND
                            SADDAM TO DO NOTHING TO WEAKEN ONE ANOTHER'S LEADERSHIP POSITION. IN
                            RESPONSE TO QUESTION, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID
                            WE DO NOT BELIEVE COMMUNISTS IN IRAQ ARE ANY STRONGER THAN THEY HAVE
                            BEEN IN RECENT YEARS AND THAT SOVIET POSTURE TOWARD IRAQ MOTIVATED BY
                            POWER RELATIONSHIP RATHER THAN IDEOLOGY. LOPINOT NOTED IRAQI REGIME'S
                            CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE TOWARD CRITICIZING KING HUSSEIN FOR HIS WEST BANK PLAN
                            AND AGREED THAT RELATIVELY MODERATE IRAQI POSTURE TOWARDS JORDAN MAY
                            REFLECT FELT NEED FOR BALANCE AGAINST SYRIAN MEMBERSHIP IN CAR. IN
                            RESPONSE LOPINOT'S QUESTION ON POSSIBILITY OPENING US INTEREST SECTION
                            BAGHDAD, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> REPLIED THAT
                            UNDER 1967 AGREEMENT WE ARE AUTHORIZED INTEREST SECTION BUT STRICTURES
                            PLACED IN PAST ON LEVEL OF US REPRESENTATION HAD MADE IT UNDESIRABLE TO
                            HAVE SOMEONE IN BAGHDAD. NOW IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
                            SOMEONE REPRESENTING US IN BELGIAN EMBASSY. LOPINOT ASKED WHAT <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'S POSITION WOULD BE ON SOVIET OR OTHER
                            INTERESTS EFFORTS TO MARKET NORTH RUMALIA OIL. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID WE UNDERSTOOD <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> WOULD SEEK TO OBSTRUCT THROUGH LEGAL
                            PROCEDURES MARKETING OF NORTH RUMALIA OIL. LOPINOT NOTED THAT ITALIANS
                            HAD CONCLUDED BARTER ARRANGEMENT WITH IRAQ CALLING FOR ITALIAN IMPORT OF
                            IRAQI CRUDE OIL. LOPINOT ASKED IF IN OUR OPINION SOVIETS WILL WANT THEIR
                            OWN "BAHRAIN AGREEMENT" WITH IRAQ FOR USE OF NAVAL FACILITIES. AFTER
                            REASSURING LOPINOT THAT OUR NAVAL PRESENCE IN BAHRAIN WHICH DATES FROM
                            LATE 1940'S REPRESENTS NO CHANGE IN US POLICY OR OBJECTIVES, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID WE FORESEE NO CHANGE IN
                            SOVIET ROLE UMM AL QASR, WHERE SOVIETS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE TO SEEK
                            PERIODIC USE OF IRAQI FACILITIES WHICH THEY HAVE HELPED DEVELOP.
                            LOPINOT, WHO SPENT 5 YEARS IN BAGHDAD PRIOR TO WASHINGTON ASSIGNMENT,
                            SAID SOVIET-IRAQI RELATIONSHIP NOT ALWAYS EASY AND THAT LATE VICE
                            PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_THAAG1">HARDAN TIKRIKI</persName> HAD
                            COMPLAINED FREQUENTLY OF SOVIET FAILURES TO LIVE UP TO PROMISES,
                            PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SPARES DELIVERY.</p>
                        <p>3. PERSIAN GULF: IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION ON IRAQI ROLE IN GULF, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID SOME IRAQIS HAD LONG FELT
                            THAT IRAQ <pb n="3" xml:id="d306-03" facs="d306-03"/>HAS "MANIFEST
                            DESTINY" IN GULF, BUT THAT WE DOUBT IRAQI THREAT TO GULF IS CREDIBLE.
                            THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ARMS SHIPMENTS TO DISSIDENT GROUPS, BUT WE DO NOT
                            ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT NEAR TERM CHANGE IN IRAQI ROLE IN GULF. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> REMINDED LOPINOT THAT HAND OF
                            BAATH PARTY HAD BEEN HEAVY IN 1965 BAHRAIN LABOR DISTURBANCES BUT THAT
                            MOST RECENT DISTURBANCES APPEAR TO HAVE RESULTED FROM LOCAL PROBLEMS AND
                            NO STRONG EVIDENCE OF IRAQI OR OUTSIDE INSTIGATION. AS TO SOVIET ROLE WE
                            FORESEE SOVIETS ATTEMPTING TO EXTEND DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL PRESENCE
                            INTO GULF AND PERHAPS OFFERING SCHOLARSHIPS OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE
                            SEE NO IMMEDIATE SOVIET THREAT BUT SOVIET OBJECTIVES ARE LONG TERM IN
                            NATURE AND BEAR WATCHING. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName>
                            POINTED OUT SOVIETS IN PAST OFFERED SIGNIFICANT SCHOLARSHIP HELP TO
                            EXILED OMANIS AND THAT SEVERAL SOVIET-EDUCATED OMANIS WHOM HE HAD MET
                            DURING DECEMBER VISIT TO MUSCAT URGED COUNTER-BALANCING US EDUCATIONAL
                            AID.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID ON HIS DECEMBER
                            TRIP HE WAS IMPRESSED BY CHANGE OF ATTITUDE OF GULF LEADERSHIP FROM
                            UNCERTAINTY TO CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE IN FUTURE AND THEIR ABILITY TO
                            COOPERATE TOGETHER. GULF STATES HAVE ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC BASE AND
                            BAHRAIN SEEMS PARTICULARLY WELL ORGANIZED BUREAUCRATICALLY. GULF LEADERS
                            RECOGNIZE REALITIES OF IRANIAN POWER AND NEED TO COOPERATE WITH IRAN.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> WAS IMPRESSED BY
                            "RATIONALISM" OF GULF LEADERS. ABU DHABI IS DISORGANIZED BUT <persName corresp="#p_UZA1">ZAYID</persName> APPEARS TO BE RAPIDLY LEARNING
                            REALITIES OF MODERN WORLD AND ESTABLISHMENT UAE COULD SERVE TO BRING
                            OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL AND BUREAUCRATIC EXPERTISE TO MAKE TRUCIAL STATES
                            FEDERATION WORK. OMAN IS EMERGING INTO 20TH CENTURY UNDER WELL-EDUCATED,
                            YOUNG SULTAN WHO IN MILITARY SPHERE SEEMS IN IMPROVED POSITION WITH
                            RESPECT TO DHOFAR INSURRECTION BUT RECOGNIZES NEED FOR CIVIC ACTION TO
                            ELIMINATE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR REBELS. SULTAN IS PROCEEDING WITH BEDOUIN
                            RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMS, EXPERIMENTAL FARMS, DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOLS, AND
                            ESTABLISHMENT GOVERNMENT BROADCASTING CAPABILITY IN DHOFAR. OMAN'S OIL
                            INCOME PROVIDES MINIMUM BASE FOR MILITARY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                            EXPENDITURES, AND RECENT FISHERIES ARRANGEMENTS WITH AMERICAN CONSORTIUM
                            OFFERS FURTHER HOPE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. SAUDI-ABU DHABI BOUNDARY
                            PROBLEM AND FACT THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAS NOT RECOGNIZED UAE REMAIN
                            PROBLEMS IN THE AREA. THERE ALS0 STILL SOME FEELING AGAINST IRAN'S
                            SEIZURE OF TUNBS, BUT RAS AL-KHAIMAH'S ENTRY INTO UAE TENDS TO MAKE THIS
                            MORE A PHILOSOPHICAL THAN A PRACTICAL PROBLEM. IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d306-04" facs="d306-04"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID UAE AGREEMENT IN
                            PRINCIPLE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH SOVIET UNION APPEARS TO REFLECT
                                <persName corresp="#p_UZA1">ZAYID</persName>'S SOMEWHAT SIMPLISTIC
                            APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND WE UNDERSTAND FAISAL FELT THIS
                            STEP DISRUPTIVE TO SECURITY PROSPECTS FOR AREA. LOPINOT ASKED IF THERE
                            WERE NOT POSSIBILITIES FOR COUPS D'ETAT IN AREA. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID THERE IS ALWAYS POSSIBILITY
                            OF COUPS OR ASSASSINATIONS IN ANY OF THE STATES OF THE AREA, BUT THE
                            GULF DOES NOT APPEAR TO US TO BE NECESSARILY DOOMED TO GO THROUGH A
                            PERIOD OF DESTRUCTIVE CHANGE. NOTING THAT SAUDI ARABIA SEEMS TO HAVE
                            DEVELOPED ITS OWN FORM OF POLITICAL STABILITY, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID THE GULF AREA IS ONE ABOUT
                            WHICH WE ARE "CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.”</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">DAVIES</persName> SAID US POLICY IS TO
                            ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN LOWER GULF AND OMAN, TO URGE STATES OF
                            THE GULF TO COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER, AND TO ENCOURAGE OUR EUROPEAN
                            ALLIES AND OUR OWN PRIVATE SECTOR TO DEVELOP TIES WITH THE NEW STATES
                            AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHERE POSSIBLE, ON A REIMBURSABLE
                            BASIS, IN MANY CASES. LOPINOT SAID THAT MINISTER OF STATE LIPKOWSKI IS
                            NOW VISITING GULF AND THAT WHILE FRANCE HAS NOT YET ENTERED INTO
                            DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NEW STATES IT PLANS TO ACCREDIT AMBASSADOR
                            CARTON IN KUWAIT TO THE GULF STATES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. YY</p>

                        <p>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY<lb/> Directorate of Intelligence<lb/> 12 May
                            1972</p>
                        <p rend="center">INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Moscow and the Persian Gulf</p>
                        <p>1. Soviet policies in the Persian Gulf have followed a consistent course
                            over the past five years. During this period, Moscow has probed the
                            area, seeking—as opportunities arose—to extend its political and
                            military influence into a region of traditional Russian concern. Iran,
                            Iraq, and Kuwait have been responsive to Soviet overtures. Moscow has
                            been particularly successful in using economic openings with Tehran and
                            Baghdad to foster the growth of policies more friendly to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. After Kuwait gained independence in
                            1961, the Soviets moved quickly to establish a diplomatic mission. In
                            1970, Soviet representatives in Kuwait arranged for Kuwaiti oil to be
                            delivered to Japan, a Soviet customer, in return for the shipment of
                            Soviet crude to Kuwait's clients in Europe.</p>
                        <p>2. Iran is now the fourth largest recipient of Soviet economic aid and
                            the second largest recipient of East European aid. Although this
                            assistance still represents only a small part of the total financing for
                            Iran's economic development program, Soviet activity is the dominant
                            foreign activity in the northern part of the country and is important in
                            other sectors. The largest Soviet project in Iran is the Isfahan steel
                            mill, which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed to
                            undertake after the West turned it down as economically unfeasible. As
                            repayment for most of its credits, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is taking a billion dollars worth of natural gas from
                            Iran over the next decade.</p>
                        <p>Note: This memorandum was prepared by the Office of Current Intelligence
                            and coordinated within the Directorate of Intelligence.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d307-02" facs="d307-02"/>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also has emerged as Iran's
                            third largest arms supplier. The most recent agreement brought Soviet
                            military aid to Iran to a total of more than $350 million. Tehran's
                            purchases have been confined to conventional armaments, such as
                            artillery and armored personnel carriers. The Shah prefers not to
                            purchase sophisticated arms from Moscow in order to avoid becoming
                            dependent on the Soviets for technical assistance and spare parts.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet-Iraqi ties have developed rapidly and have led to the signing
                            of a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation on 9 April. Last fall Moscow
                            agreed to deliver to Iraq military equipment worth about $250 million.
                            AAA guns, anti-tank rockets, armored personnel carriers, and fighter
                            aircraft were included. Several months ago, according to a clandestine
                            source, Soviet SA-3 surface-to-air missiles were unloaded at the port of
                            Umm Qasr, and Iraq probably has more than enough equipment for four SA-3
                            firing units. The Iraqis presumably have acquired this low-altitude air
                            defense system under the arms agreement signed in October.</p>
                        <p>5. Article Nine of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation could,
                            moreover, lead to a greater Soviet military presence in Iraq. That
                            article states, "In the interests of the security of both countries, the
                            high contracting parties will continue to develop cooperation in the
                            strengthening of their defense capabilities.” This is a careful
                            formulation and raises the possibility of reciprocity in the
                            Soviet-Iraqi military relationship; the formulation was not in the
                            Soviet treaties with Egypt and India. The friendship treaty with India
                            had no defense provision, and the treaty with Cairo was designed "in the
                            interests of…the United Arab Republic" to strengthen only Egypt's
                            defense capability.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of logistic constraints on Soviet operations in the Indian
                            Ocean, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might be interested in
                            obtaining support facilities in Iraq similar to those now available to
                            the Soviet Navy in the Mediterranean. Such facilities would increase the
                            on-station time of Soviet naval ships in <pb n="3" xml:id="d307-03" facs="d307-03"/>both the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. In
                            addition, the Soviets could seek air access to speed the exchange of
                            naval crews and replacement of parts and to provide landing facilities
                            for naval reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
                        <p>7. At the moment, Iraq does not have a sufficient maintenance and repair
                            capacity to handle Soviet naval ships. The facilities of Basra, Iraq's
                            only large port, are in continuous use; those at the small port of Umm
                            Qasr would have to be expanded to provide effective support. Umm Qasr
                            does have a natural deep harbor with a large anchorage area, and the
                            Iraqi Air Force has excellent facilities nearby. The Iraqi Air Force,
                            moreover, has with Soviet assistance just built six military airfields
                            that could be used to support a Soviet naval presence in the Indian
                            Ocean.</p>
                        <p>8. The friendship treaty also stated that the Soviets' involvement in
                            developing Iraq's industry and natural resources would be strengthened.
                            This involvement has been increasing since 1969 when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> committed at least $170 million to
                            Iraq's national oil industry. The Soviets agreed to provide equipment
                            and technical services for projects, primarily in the North Rumaila oil
                            field in southern Iraq, and they are slated to build a refinery at
                            Mosul. Soviet personnel are also surveying a proposed pipeline from
                            Baghdad to Basra and an extension of the pipeline from Baghdad to
                            northern Iraq. Most of this aid is to be repaid in crude oil
                            deliveries.</p>
                        <p>9. In the long term, an increase in Soviet political influence in the
                            Persian Gulf would offer Moscow an opportunity to exercise some
                            influence over the gulf oil industry. The Soviets have been cautious
                            about this, however, and with good reason. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not only self-sufficient in oil, but is a large net
                            exporter of oil and is likely to remain so throughout this decade. The
                            Soviets, moreover, would be reluctant to pay hard currency for Persian
                            Gulf oil and have shown no desire to absorb more than a fraction of the
                            oil produced there.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d307-04" facs="d307-04"/>
                        <p>10. Moscow's assistance to the oil-producing nations at present is
                            confined mainly to production operations. The Soviets are not able to
                            supplant the various international companies in marketing petroleum. In
                            this field Soviet technical expertise and machinery are in disrepute,
                            and it is difficult for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            provide transport facilities. Therefore, Moscow's policy has been merely
                            to urge producer governments to demand maximum revenues from Western
                            companies and to avoid incurring any obligations to purchase or dispose
                            of the oil. The Soviets are also inhibited, of course, by the recent
                            Arab tendency to exclude foreign political influence from the oil
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>11. The departure of the British and the emergence of the newly
                            independent states of Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in
                            the second half of 1971 has presented the Soviets with new openings for
                            expanding their presence in the Gulf. Soviet President <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> quickly cabled Moscow's
                            official recognition of all three soon after independence, but only in
                            the case of the United Arab Emirates did he publicly convey Moscow's
                            "willingness to establish diplomatic relations.” The foreign ministry of
                            the United Arab Emirates revealed in February that an agreement to
                            exchange diplomatic representation had been concluded, but pressure from
                            Saudi Arabia caused the Emirates to delay the establishment of a Soviet
                            Embassy in Abu Dhabi, the capital. Saudi pressure has also caused
                            Bahrain and Qatar to refuse to exchange representatives with the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>12. As in the case of Kuwait in the 1960s, the Soviets will continue to
                            press for a diplomatic presence in these new states and in Oman, as well
                            An Abu Dhabi source remarked privately earlier this month that the
                            United Arab Emirates was "resisting" Soviet pressures and that the
                            opening of a Soviet Embassy is several months away. The Soviets also may
                            offer limited economic aid programs to the new governments. This would
                            enable Moscow to gain greater knowledge of the area and to improve the
                            Soviet image throughout the Gulf.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d307-05" facs="d307-05"/>
                        <p>13. The Soviets are being cautious about encouraging subversive activity
                            in the area. They have established contact with the Popular Front for
                            the Liberation of Oman and Arab Gulf and the Bahraini National
                            Liberation Front and apparently have provided some small arms and
                            limited funds to the former through Yemen (Aden). As in the case of
                            Aden, however, Moscow will wait until a radical element has given
                            evidence of being able to endure before channeling more substantial
                            equipment and support to the liberation movement. Meanwhile, Soviet
                            propaganda has become less enthusiastic over the prospects for success
                            of liberation movements in the area.</p>
                        <p>14. Although greater Soviet involvement in the Gulf area is virtually a
                            foregone conclusion, there are limits on Moscow's freedom to maneuver.
                            In the first place, greater Soviet attention to the Gulf could disturb
                            the friendly relations that currently exist between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Iran. The Soviet assistance
                            programs in Iran are large and important. They are being implemented
                            more rapidly than Soviet programs in other less developed countries;
                            only India and Egypt receive larger amounts of Communist aid. The
                            political and economic benefits that have accrued to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from its trade and aid ties with Iran
                            have become important policy considerations in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>15. The Soviets have been telling Tehran that the Soviet rapprochement
                            with Iraq is not aimed against Iran. On several occasions during the
                            past year, the Soviets tried to reassure the Iranians regarding
                            Baghdad's intentions and stressed Moscow's desire to expand its ties
                            with Iran. Last November, for example, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> refused a request by Iraq that Moscow protest Iran's
                            seizure of islands in the Persian Gulf. According to a clandestine
                            source, moreover, the Soviets rejected an Iraqi request that the
                            friendship treaty include a guarantee the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would intervene if Iraq were attacked by Iran.</p>
                        <p>16. While the Soviets could use naval facilities in the Indian Ocean for
                            their ships, they have not assigned a high priority to securing such
                            facilities in the Gulf itself. One Soviet official has <pb n="6" xml:id="d307-06" facs="d307-06"/>described the Gulf as a "mousetrap
                            for all ships.” In any event, it will remain difficult for the Soviets
                            to carry on naval activity in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf as
                            long as the Suez Canal remains closed. Soviet military activity could
                            also stimulate increased cooperation among the smaller Gulf states, as
                            well as strong reactions from Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>17. The Soviets probably will continue to encourage radical groups in the
                            area, but will be discreet in order that their efforts remain
                            undetected. They will not provide substantial assistance to the
                            liberation movements and will not commit their own forces to any attempt
                            to overthrow the conservative Gulf regimes. In view of the fragile
                            political structure in the area, however, it is well to remember that
                            even a minimal Soviet effort to support subversive groups could have
                            considerable impact.</p>
                        <p>18. In sum, the Soviets probably will continue to follow the policy they
                            have pursued over the past five years with significant success,
                            particularly in their relations with Iraq and Iran. Even better ties
                            with Iraq can be expected, and the Soviets will use their influence to
                            try to push the Baghdad government closer to their other major Arab
                            clients, Egypt and Syria. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                            avoid taking sides in the disputes between Iran and Iraq, hoping the
                            Shah will come to accept the greater Soviet involvement with Baghdad. In
                            the long run, a stronger Soviet political position and a more obtrusive
                            military posture can be expected throughout the Persian Gulf.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iraqi Politics in Perspective</p>
                        <p>Chronic instability and an extremist nationalism bordering on the
                            xenophobic have led Iraq to be regarded as about the most unreliable and
                            least realistic of Mid-East states, even in the view of other Arabs.
                            This has meant not only Iraq's isolation within the Arab world but also
                            ambivalent and unsteady relations with the outside world and great
                            powers, including the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for this legacy are not ones likely to vanish in the
                            short-term future: At its birth, mandate Iraq never constituted an
                            harmonious national entity and its society remains today severely split
                            along ethnic and religious lines; Kurdish irredentism is one serious
                            example. British mandate and the British-installed monarchy found a
                            solution only in harsh and imposed rule and the continual jockeying of
                            forces within Iraq; all efforts to cultivate a broad-based government or
                            political constituency failed. In turn, Iraqi nationalist leadership
                            evolved with the same militaristic mentality and inability to resolve
                            internal divisiveness except through force. Additionally, in reaction to
                            the long years of Western domination, Iraqi nationalists developed an
                            unusually intense hatred for foreign (then Western, but later also
                            Soviet) influence. The Arab/Israeli problem in particular intensified
                            anti-Western sentiments.</p>
                        <p>Further, the Iraqi nationalist movement—like Iraqi society and like the
                            Arab nationalist movement in general—was itself never capable of unity.
                            No single individual (a NASSER) or single nationalist orientation has
                            ever emerged. Baghdad, Cairo and Damascus have traditionally contested
                            for pre-eminence in the Arab world and varying generations of Iraqi
                            nationalists held conflicting views on Iraq's proper bent, some wishing
                            to obliterate all other Arab influences within Iraq, some intent on
                            pan-Arab unity at any cost. Influence struggles among Iraqi officers led
                            to increasing fragmentation and conflicting Iraqi strategies, both
                            within and without.</p>
                        <p>In reaction to internal schisms and perceived external threats (either
                            foreign or other Arab), Iraq has produced a generation of wildly
                            nationalistic and erratic military dictators whose power plays and purge
                            of opposition have steadily decreased the size of the power base and
                            increased the precarious <pb n="2" xml:id="d308-02" facs="d308-02"/>nature of any hold on leadership by those who triumphed. Regimes since
                            the monarchy was toppled in 1958 have thus been basically unstable. They
                            have used force against every segment of society, including the
                            communists, to consolidate power. To the degree they have been radically
                            nationalistic, Iraqi regimes have moved backwards and forwards in their
                            relations with other Arab states and with the great powers. The Soviets,
                            who embraced the cause immediately in 1958 and began large-scale
                            economic and military assistance, found themselves at various times
                            loved and unloved, as communists (who themselves have been brutal in
                            Iraq) were being purged or as overtures were being made to the West.
                            Over the years, too, Iraqi regimes have approached Damascus, Cairo and
                            Amman for unity pacts; as those nationalisms held influence in Iraq and
                            presented an internal threat, Iraqi regimes would back off.</p>
                        <p>The 1967 war caused another convulsion within Iraq after a few years of
                            relative calm and even near cordial relations with the US. The passions
                            of that war unleased the most leftist nationalists and by 1968 the
                            Baathis (who also dominate in Syria) consolidated in power and remain
                            there today. Generally speaking, all good Baathis ascribe in excess to
                            the Arab nationalist principles of unity, socialism, liberty and
                            revolution and to the theory that the Arab world is an indivisible
                            political, social and economic whole. It is perceived as a purely Arab
                            movement and therefore incompatible with Communism; in fact, during a
                            short-lived Baathi regime in 1963 in Iraq, there occurred the most
                            brutal attacks on local communists in modern Iraqi history.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the current Baath leadership has taken a number of
                            pragmatic steps internally (overtures to the Kurds and to the
                            communists) and externally (closer alignment with the Soviets and
                            overtures towards Syria and Egypt) which could lengthen the life of its
                            regime — assuming these work and the normal forces which have always
                            torn Iraq apart can be repressed. The reports of brutality and internal
                            purge that emanate from this regime are especially depressing.</p>
                        <p>Two men appear to be the foci of power: President <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName>, commander of the armed forces and
                            head of the military wing of the Baathis; and <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">Saddam Hussein Tikriti</persName>, civilian Baath
                            leader and virtual king of the Iraqi security apparatus. <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> is thought to be an Iraqi-firster,
                            opposed to excessive Soviet or pro-Nasserist influence and is believed
                            to want better relations <pb n="3" xml:id="d308-03" facs="d308-03"/>with
                            Baathist Syria. <persName>Tikriti</persName> is known as a hardliner on
                            consolidating Baath pre-eminence and is believed to be the strongman at
                            the moment. It was <persName>Tikriti</persName> who evidently initiated
                            and then negotiated the friendship treaty with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Regional Relations</p>
                        <p>Iraq's relations in the area have been notoriously poor. It has been
                            snubbed from two directions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Iraq and Iran have sustained perpetual operations across their common
                            border, though both sides contain actions to fall short of a major
                            confrontation. Mutual distrust is partly historical and cultural. More
                            importantly, the Shah views the unstable and radical character of the
                            Baathis and their vulnerability to Soviet influence as a serious threat
                            to Iran and its position in the Gulf. He has backed coup attempts,
                            conducted provocations along the border and supported the Kurdish
                            rebellion to keep Iraqi regimes off-guard. In the past, the Iraqis have
                            not contributed significantly to trouble in the Gulf. However, with the
                            departure of the British, the Baathis have campaigned vociferously as
                            its Arab protectors and have further alarmed the Shah. Their noise
                            stimulated the otherwise reluctant Arabs to take the issue of the Shah's
                            seizure of the islands at the mouth of the Gulf to the Security Council
                            late last year. They may also feel the Soviet treaty will give them
                            greater weight in the area. Finally, Iraq has some scare power over its
                            weaker neighbors such as Kuwait, causing the latter to waffle on issues
                            important to the Shah (the islands).</p>
                        <p>On balance, the Iraqis might have the potential for a greater influence
                            in the Gulf. However, their own record of instability, inability to
                            cooperate with other Arabs and xenophobic instincts, which could lead
                            them to snap back even at the Soviets, could be the checks.</p>
                        <p>(2) Iraq and the Arab world have had unhappy relations. In addition to
                            Baghdad's traditional rivalries with Cairo and Damascus, its excesses
                            and cruel tactics of leadership have alienated all segments <pb n="4" xml:id="d308-04" facs="d308-04"/>of the Arab world. Its strong
                            rhetoric coupled with a distinct lack of involvement in the Arab/Israeli
                            dispute have earned it zero credibility on that score. Iraq has never
                            accepted Resolution 242 and has bitterly denounced its Arab neighbors
                            for involvement in negotiating efforts.</p>
                        <p>Discounted as both useless and obnoxious, Iraq has found itself in a
                            position of isolation. Recently, however, the Baathis have made
                            overtures towards ending this isolation. For one thing, some regard the
                            Soviet treaty as an effort by the regime to enhance lagging credibility
                            both at home and within the Arab world, in a manner emulating the
                            Egyptians. There is also reason to believe the Soviets are pressing Iraq
                            to move closer to Syria and Egypt — which would make sense to the
                            Soviets whose first loyalties are to Egypt. Also, capitalizing on Arab
                            reactions to <persName>Hussein</persName>'s West Bank plan, Iraq has
                            called for a united front between Iraq, Syria and Egypt. The response
                            has not been overwhelming since, of course, Syria, Egypt and Libya are
                            already in a confederation; at a minimum, however, the initiative has
                            generated dialogue among the three capitals which is by itself an
                            accomplishment for Iraq.</p>
                        <p>It remains to be seen whether under this regime Iraq can play any more of
                            a useful role in the area than it has in the past.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Presence</p>
                        <p>Before 1958, military and economic assistance to Iraq came entirely from
                            the West. Since 1958, it has come overwhelmingly from the Soviets and
                            Eastern Europe, though a modest Western program has survived. Since
                            1958, some $1 billion in communist military assistance has been
                            committed, the bulk from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            (making Iraq second only to Egypt as the most active Mid East recipient)
                            and close to a billion ($830 million) in economic assistance, the lion's
                            share of which has gone to Iraq's potentially rich oil industry.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets provided the greatest support to the 1958 coup and offered
                            immediate economic and military aid; the regime, fearing Western or
                            Baghdad Power intervention, accepted and thus an orientation towards the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was established from the
                            outset. However, relations have been <pb n="5" xml:id="d308-05" facs="d308-05"/>rocky, depending on the vagaries of a given regime.
                            They peaked in the first few years after the 1958 coup as both Soviet
                            assistance and support of local communists were needed by the new
                            regime, then ebbed and flowed in the early sixties as other less radical
                            regimes reversed those trends and balanced off Iraq's posture with the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>They peaked again after the 1967 war. However, the bulk of post-war
                            assistance has been arranged under the current Baath regime following a
                            decision by that regime in early 1969 to permit the Soviets a long-term
                            role in the development of Iraq's richest oil fields. Since that
                            decision, the largest Soviet economic (most for oil) and military
                            commitments ever have been made, one set in 1969 and one set in
                            1971.</p>
                        <p>—Military capability: Despite large-scale Soviet assistance, the Iraqis
                            have not been particularly successful in absorbing sophisticated
                            weaponry, though training is continuing. According to our intelligence
                            estimates, Iraqi armed forces are capable of maintaining internal
                            security and defending its borders against attacks by its Arab
                            neighbors, but could not withstand attack by Turkey or Iran.
                            Specifically: (a) The Iraqi Army has limited offensive capabilities and
                            could not sustain significant operations in the Arab-Israeli theater.
                            (b) Iraq's air defense system is almost nonexistent. They could not
                            operate the SA-2 and resold it to Egypt in 1962. However, they are now
                            promised the SA-3. They do possess a potential strategic capability with
                            Badger aircraft. (c) The Navy is capable of conducting small-scale
                            patrol operations along the coast and causing harassment. Any real
                            combat capability of the navy is nil. Generally, the Iraqis suffer from
                            weaknesses common to all Arabs.</p>
                        <p>Early this year the Soviet-Iraqi friendship treaty was concluded and, as
                            with the Egyptian and Indian treaties, it has been billed as nothing
                            surprising or sudden but rather a culmination of existing relationships.
                            The standard parts of the treaty are like those of the Egyptian and
                            Indian treaties calling for a wide range of cooperation in political,
                            economic and military fields and regular consultations on important
                            issues for the purpose of coordinating their stands. [None of the three
                            specifically provides for mutual assistance or military coordination in
                            the event of hostilities, however.] <pb n="6" xml:id="d308-06" facs="d308-06"/>Special tailoring of the Soviet-Iraqi treaty appears
                            in several areas. (a) The military paragraph states that both sides will
                            "continue to develop cooperation in the field of strengthening the
                            defense capabilities of each.” The Indian treaty has no defense
                            commitment; the Egyptian treaty is targeted more specifically at Soviet
                            assistance to Egypt. The Iraqi treaty suggests the Soviets found
                            language that could stretch to cover Soviet base facilities in Iraqi
                            ports, if they are granted, though the military language is more general
                            than that of the Egyptian treaty. (b) There is no clause from the
                            Egyptian treaty calling for a just Mid-East peace in accordance with
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> principles; rather the Soviets
                            signed on to a statement calling for an unrelenting struggle against
                            Zionism and imperialism. On the other hand, the Iraqis did agree to
                            preambular language stating both parties believed world problems should
                            be solved by cooperation and solutions acceptable to concerned parties.
                            This is mild language for the Baath but probably required of them to
                            meet Soviet needs.</p>
                        <p>—For the Iraqi part, it appears they were the instigators of the treaty
                            discussions. <persName>Tikriti</persName>'s regime has been in trouble
                            at home and isolated within the Arab world. Formalizing Soviet support
                            may have been viewed as enhancing the internal position of the Baath as
                            well as putting it in a position to have greater influence in the Arab
                            world and in the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>—For the Soviet part, they have demonstrated interest in consolidating
                            assets in the area for which they have long been picking up the tab, at
                            a time when the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are moving
                            to summit dialogue and when the Chinese are beginning to enter the
                            Mid-East scene. However, it appears this move (which may even have been
                            reluctant) has not been entirely without caution: (a) First, the Soviets
                            have been at pains to stress that the treaty is not aimed at any other
                            country. This, of course, is to protect Soviet relations with Iran. We
                            have reason to believe the Soviets refused a request by Tikriti that the
                            Soviets guarantee to intervene in the event Iraq is attacked by Iran.
                            (b) Second, the Soviets are believed to have pressed Tikriti to do two
                            things if a treaty were to be signed: First; he is to work on
                            stabilizing the internal front by getting the Kurds and local communists
                            into a national front government with the Baath. The Kurds, who have
                            been seeking autonomy for a decade, have been one of the worst threats
                            to Iraqi stability; while the Baath reached an accord for Kurd <pb n="7" xml:id="d308-07" facs="d308-07"/>participation in government in
                            1970, it has never been implemented since the Kurds remain highly
                            skeptical of what will happen to them under the Baath. They are refusing
                            recent pleas made by <persName>Tikriti</persName> under Soviet pressure.
                            The Soviets would also like to see local communists — excluded and/or
                            purged under the Baath — more fully integrated. Second, the Soviets are
                            believed to be pressing <persName>Tikriti</persName> to improve
                            relations with Egypt and Syria. At least dialogue has been generated by
                            the recent Iraqi call for a unity pact.</p>
                        <p>These pressures would make sense from the Soviet point of view. Given
                            Iraq's reputation, internal stability is important to the heavy
                            financial investment the Soviets are making in Iraq and to the foothold
                            they may hope to have vis-a-vis the Gulf. Cooperation among Baghdad,
                            Damascus and Cairo is highly important to the protection of Soviet
                            influence in Egypt and the Egyptian-Syrian flank.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Iraq is so basically unstable that it is difficult to guage the
                            durability and hence the significance of what present trends mean or
                            whether they or the regime will last very long.</p>
                        <p>2. Despite Iraq's unreliable record and its strong fear of foreign
                            domination, Iraqi-Soviet relations have improved under the current
                            regime and Soviet assistance has peaked in ways besides military
                            assistance that will entail long-term involvement (oil and a
                            treaty).</p>
                        <p>3. However, the Soviets have been sacked before and they could be sacked
                            again, but at a minimum they will exert influence because of the Iraqi
                            need for assistance. To the degree that Soviet influence increases and
                            results in further Soviet assets such as base facilities, much would
                            seem to depend on (a) stabilizations of the internal scene and a shared
                            interest in Iraq's ambitions in the areas and (b) juggling these against
                            the protection of Soviet-Iranian relations.</p>
                        <p>4. At a minimum, the Shah is disturbed by developments in Iraq. A
                            sharpened contest with Iraq would generate further instability in the
                            Gulf.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d308-08" facs="d308-08"/>
                        <p>5. Iraq has the potential for trouble-making in the Gulf if it can
                            adeptly use Soviet support, and the Soviets have greater prospects for
                            increasing their influence if they move cautiously. In terms of U. S.
                            interests, oil investment and supply continue to give us a tie to Iraq
                            despite the break in diplomatic relations. There are some who argue that
                            we should make an effort to supplement this by expanded commercial ties
                            where possible, but prospects for any general improvement in relations
                            now seem slim.</p>

                            in Baghdad</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                        <p>Relations with the. Government of Iraq were broken in June 1967 as the
                            result of the Six Day War. Arrangements between our governments at that
                            time called for each government to assign a nominal number of
                            personnel-to staff Interests Sections in Baghdad and Washington.
                            Primarily because of the low level representation proposed by the Iraqis
                            for these Sections, we did not exercise our option to maintain an
                            Interests Section in Baghdad. The Iraqi Government, however, has
                            maintained an Iraqi-manned Interests Section in the Indian Embassy in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Since that time, there has been a continuing desire on the part of our
                            Government to have better political and economic information from Iraq
                            and we believe that the time is at hand for us to establish a US
                            Interests Section in Baghdad staffed with American personnel. You will
                            recall having cleared my memorandum dated April 22, 1971, in which I
                            informed the Secretary of our intention to establish the Interests
                            Section in Baghdad. Subsequently we discussed the matter of assignment
                            of US Officers with the Governments of Belgium and Iraq and found both
                            agreeable to our doing so. Accordingly, we plan to effect establishment
                            of a US Interests Section as expeditiously as possible. Specific actions
                            which must be taken are discussed below.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Location:</p>
                        <p>The US Interests Section will be located in Baghdad and will function as
                            a part of the Belgian Embassy there. <pb n="2" xml:id="d309-02" facs="d309-02"/>While we do not have a completely reliable picture,
                            we believe that there is sufficient <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            furniture and equipment with the Belgians to meet our immediate
                            operational needs. Once established, the Officer who heads up our
                            Interests Section will submit detailed information as to requirements
                            with his recommendations for further Bureau actions in this regard.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Staff:</p>
                        <p>We plan to staff the US Interests Section with two officers; an <gloss target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss>-4 Arab Language and Area Officer who
                            would be in charge and an <gloss target="#t_FSS1">FSS</gloss>-4
                            Administrative Officer who would be accompanied by a working wife who
                            would become the third employee handling secretarial duties. We also
                            will require the assignment of twelve locals, all previous <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> employees, to the Interests Section.
                            These twelve employees who have been working with the Belgian Embassy
                            since 1967 will be taken over after arrival of the American principal
                            officer.</p>
                        <p>As you know, when Baghdad became a closed post in 1967, all American
                            personnel left Iraq and a group of local employees moved over to the
                            employ of the Belgian Embassy to facilitate its job of looking after our
                            interests. The Bureau was given to understand at the time that the
                            positions it gave up, both American and local, would be restored at such
                            time in the future as they would be required again for Iraq. We are
                            aware of current limitations and the tight personnel situation facing
                            the Department and have carefully reviewed our options. It now appears
                            that the Bureau can best meet the Baghdad requirement for American
                            positions by transferring the three American positions needed there from
                            Cairo. We base this judgement on the situation developing from the
                            Egyptian Government's decision to reduce the respective Interests
                            Sections in Cairo and Washington. While we do not as yet have any firm
                            figure indicating how many positions we will be able to maintain nor the
                            composition of the future staff, we are confident that we will be able
                            to find three positions required for Baghdad within the final reduction
                            figure applying to Cairo. Other American positions remaining to us after
                            the staff reduction, we expect will be required for TDY <pb n="3" xml:id="d309-03" facs="d309-03"/>support to the reduced Cairo
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as local positions are concerned we must look to you for
                            assistance. I am not ready to contemplate a reduction in the local staff
                            at Cairo. All local employees are engaged in key positions and a
                            reduction in this group could further hamper our ability to operate.
                            Looking at our present resources, we are, as you know, engaged in
                            reducing thirty-eight administrative positions as part of the
                            President's <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-72 reduction. In view of
                            these circumstances we do not have these positions available for
                            programming within the Bureau. Accordingly, we request allocation of

                        <p>Living since remote antiquity in much the same mountainous area where
                            they are presently found, the Kurdish people, now numbering around six
                            million, have complicated the relations of all the modern states whose
                            borders they overlap — the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Mulla Mustafa Barzani, the latest leader
                            with the gifts needed to unite several tribes into a formidable
                            paramilitary force, rose first against the Iraqi monarchy in the 1940's,
                            was expelled to Iran, and then to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> where he lived for eleven years and learned to
                            distrust the Soviets. He returned to Iraq shortly after the 1958
                            revolution. In 1961, having made himself uncontested leader among the
                            Kurdish tribes, Mustafa led a guerrilla war that continued under, and
                            helped to precipitate, four changes of regime. During most of the four
                            years of intensive fighting, Mulla Mustafa's forces had assistance and
                            supplies from Iran and, the Iraqis suspected, from other countries as
                            well, through Iran. Iranian considerations were to fend off NASSER's
                            influence on a weak neighbor, and to prevent the disturbance from
                            spreading among Iran's own Kurds.</p>
                        <p>The present Ba'th regime in Iraq has been under some pressure from other
                            Arab states to satisfy the Kurds so as to have the Iraqi army, which was
                            entirely tied down during the height of the insurgency, available in the
                            event of full-scale Arab-Israeli hostilities. The Soviets have
                            consistently urged Iraq to handle the Kurds as they do <pb n="3" xml:id="d310-03" facs="d310-03"/>their national minorities. Moscow
                            may have played a role in a fairly generous unilateral offer of
                            settlement which the government advanced and the Kurds accepted in 1970,
                            but which has never been fully implemented. Now intent on solidifying
                            relations with Iraq through a new treaty and extensive military and
                            technical assistance programs, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            does not want to be caught between Iraq, Iran, and the Kurds in a
                            disruptive civil war. The Soviets are pressing the Kurds to join in a
                            National Front Government with the ruling Ba'th Party and the Communist
                            Party of Iraq. Mulla Mustafa correctly foresees the loss of the de facto
                            regional autonomy the Kurds have won by force of arms, if they consent
                            to this plan. He is aware that the government and, he believes, the
                            Soviets also, were behind attempts to assassinate him and his elder son
                            Idris last summer, and he thoroughly distrusts both of the other parties
                            to this proposed coalition. <persName>Barzani</persName> also knows that
                            the government has lately tried to buy support among
                                anti-<persName>Barzani</persName> tribes and has sought to undermine
                            him by bribing some of his followers.</p>
                        <p>A younger, reformists and leftist faction does exist among the Kurds. Its
                            spokesman, Jalal Talabani, gives his loyalty to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> in time of conflict but opposes his
                            program when at peace. Although he has far less influence than
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> (none at all among the traditional,
                            semi-feudal tribesmen), he offers the sort of leadership that the
                            government (and the Soviets) would prefer to build up at <pb n="4" xml:id="d310-04" facs="d310-04"/>
                            <persName>Barzani</persName>'s expense. If he does not fight,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>'s personal leadership is likely to be
                            gradually eroded by such tactics. Time is also against him (he is 69
                            years old, though still vigorous); so is the fact that his war-weary
                            followers may be reluctant to take up arms again so soon after the long,
                            wearing struggle of the 1960's.</p>
                        <p>Chances look better than even, however, that Mulla Mustafa will find
                            sufficient outside support to renew his insurgency. If he does, he
                            cannot look forward to more than holding his own in his mountain
                            fastness. The added strain of another Kurdish war could bring down the
                            unpopular Ba'th government. However, the Kurds probably would not be
                            able to determine the composition of the next regime. Nor would any
                            likely Iraqi successors be more stable, stronger, or very much less
                            dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than the present
                            government.</p>

                            <persName>Barzani</persName>, whose personal appeal has been stronger
                            than any Kurdish figure of this generation, has strictly refrained from
                            political agitation or organizing among Kurds in neighboring countries.
                            The younger, leftist leadership that might succeed him is unlikely to be
                            as discreet. And the Soviets, should they become directly involved in
                            Kurdish affairs, would have on hand a difficult political situation, but
                            also a means for pressure on Iran, and on a lesser scale on Turkey, if
                            they chose to use it.</p>

                        <p>I. Background</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Who and Where are the Kurds?</p>
                        <p>The Kurds, a distinctive Indo-European ethnic group, form the majority
                            population of a mountainous territory approximately 150,000 square miles
                            in size which overlaps the boundaries of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and
                            Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan. This traditional "Kurdistan" has never
                            had separate political status and therefore is not precisely defined.
                            There are a few communities outside this Kurdish heartland in Iraq,
                            Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and a scattering in Afghanistan and Lebanon.
                            There are no accurate population figures; most national censuses do not
                            distinguish Kurds, but reliable estimates put their total number at
                            between five and six million, of which 89,000 are in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Of the Kurds outside Soviet territory, nearly half are in Turkey, where
                            they are the largest minority, 3 million, or about 8%. They are also a
                            significant minority in Iran (1,050,000, approximately 3%), Iraq
                            (1,795,000, or 18%), Syria (around 240,000). Nearly all Kurds are Sunni
                            (orthodox) Muslim; about 25,000 in Iraq are Yezidi (a heterodox offshoot
                            of Shia Islam with pagan and Christian intermixtures), and a third or
                            less of Iranian Kurds are Shia Muslim, the predominant religion of
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>Kurds have inhabited their mountain fastnesses since antiquity: they were
                            described by Xenophon, and identified by classical historians as
                            "Karduchoi" or "Gurti" (Iranian Kurds sometimes call themselves,
                            inaccurately, descendents of the ancient Medes). They are mountaineers,
                            mostly pastoral nomads or semi-nomads, although same are settled and
                            some urbanized. Kurds are a proud, tough, competent people: educated
                            Kurds have held high positions in their countries of residence.
                            Possessing a strong sense of identity and historical tradition, they
                            stoutly resist assimilation, especially in Arab countries, for they are
                            traditionally and universally contemptuous of Arabs.</p>
                        <p>The political independence Kurds have long desired, and petitioned for at
                            World War I peace conferences, is blocked largely by fierce and divisive
                            tribal loyalties that make Kurds, even among themselves, suspicious
                            acquaintances and determined enemies. Lack of intercommunication in
                            their mountainous terrain has preserved three distinct Kurdish dialects
                            that are scarcely intelligible to one other. The speech of the
                            Sulaymaniya region in Iraq is nearest to an accepted "official"
                            language. There are some 23 major tribal groupings, of which the most
                            important are the Dizai, Herki, and Jaf. (The
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> are not a tribe, but a confederation of
                            villages united by an early nineteenth century religious movement.)</p>

                        <p>Serious uprisings have challenged the local governments only when a
                            single leader has appeared with sufficient talent to unite several
                            tribes. Such revolts occurred in Iran in the 1920's, and in Iraq in 1931

                        <p> Mulla Mustafa Barzani first rose against the Iraqi monarchy in the
                            1940's and was expelled with his followers to northern Iran, where he
                            took part in the short-lived "Kurdish Republic of Mahabad" fostered by
                            the Soviets in the part of Iran they had occupied during World War II.
                            When Soviet forces withdrew in 1946, the "Republic" was quickly crushed
                            and Mulla Mustafa with about 500 followers fled in 1947 to Soviet
                            territory, where they remained for eleven years.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish Republic has made strenuous efforts to "Turkify" its Kurdish
                            populace, and believes that the Kurds now constitute no political
                            danger, although there is still latent sympathy among them for Kurdish
                            independence. At the height of the Iraqi civil strife in the 1960's,
                            several hundred Turkish Kurds exfiltrated to join their Iraqi brethren.
                            Iranian Kurds have been consistently critical of the government, largely
                            on grounds of alleged economic discrimination. The Iraqi uprising, among
                            other effects, brought about some hasty economic reforms in Iranian
                            Kurdistan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Kurds and Arab Politics</p>
                        <p>In Iraq, the Kurds carry political weight beyond their numbers because of
                            the peculiar religious fractioning of the country. Iraq's Arab
                            population is almost equally divided between the orthodox Sunni and
                            heterodox Shi'a sects of Islam: Shi'a are actually somewhat more
                            numerous, but for historical reasons the ruling group is almost
                            exclusively Sunni. The Kurds, ethnically distinct but religiously
                            orthodox, thus hold the balance of power. The Iraq government has
                            resisted Kurdish demands for local autonomy because of this religious
                            balance; because it fears that were these demands granted, the Shi'a and
                            other, smaller minorities would demand the same prerogatives; and
                            because Iraq's oldest and largest oil-producing area lies in Kurdish
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>From the time they were made unwilling parts of the two Arab states
                            following World War I, a cardinal interest of the Iraqi and Syrian Kurds
                            has been to oppose any sort of Arab union, in which they would be an
                            even smaller minority. Hence they opposed the abortive anti-NASSER union
                            of Iraq and Jordan in 1958, and also opposed NASSER insofar as he
                            advocated Arab unity. They are equally negative toward the Ba'th, the
                            present Iraqi ruling party, which is pro-Arab-union as an article of
                            dogma. At times they have sought to play off Nasserites and Ba'this
                            against each other.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Insurgency</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the 1958 revolution, when Qasim was replacing national
                            leaders who had cooperated with the former regime, he amnestied Mulla
                            Mustafa, invited him and his followers to return from exile, and
                            publicly lionized him. Qasim had miscalculated the extent to which Mulla
                            Mustafa was still a symbol of resistance to central government. His
                            attentions to the Kurdish chief roused a ferment of irredentist feeling
                            that went beyond any concessions Qasim was prepared to make. Too late,
                            Qasim attempted to subsidize anti-<persName>Barzani</persName> tribes to
                            put a check on the developing Kurdish movement. Inter-tribal fighting
                            broke out in August 1960; by July 1961 <persName>Barzani</persName> had
                            put his tribal enemies to flight or reduced them to submission. Earlier
                            Kurdish cultural and economic demands based on full implementation of
                            the 1958 Iraqi constitution had by then become a proposal for an
                            Arab-Kurdish federal state with joint capitals at Baghdad and
                            Sulaimaniya.(/*/) From mid-September 1961, the Iraq government resorted
                            to aerial bombing, and in 1963 experimented briefly with poison gas.
                            (The latter tactic, besides being unsuccessful militarily, was
                            embarrassing when a changing wind blew some gas across the border where
                            it affected several Iranian villagers and some animals.)</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (*)Realistically, the Kurdish leadership did not then or later
                            demand independence, only varying degrees of autonomy within the Iraqi
                            state.</p>
                        <p>The conflict quickly became a typical guerrilla situation, with the Kurds
                            in full control of the northern mountain area and ranging freely as far
                            south as the Lesser Zab river and West to Jabal Hamrin. They made no
                            attempt to control major towns of the plain, such as Erbil and Kirkuk,
                            or important highways, but interdicted roads or surrounded towns
                            selectively almost at will. In the area under their control — over
                            11,000 square miles, the combined size of Maryland and Delaware — the
                            Kurds were the effective government, collecting taxes (unfortunates in
                            the disputed areas had to pay twice!), assessing tariffs, and conducting
                            day-to-day administration. With intermissions for winter weather and for
                            occasional tries at negotiation, this situation dragged on for eight
                            years, with the Kurds unable permanently to extend their perimeter, and
                            government forces incapable of a clear-cut victory. During most of that
                            time, the Pesh Merga (Kurdish irregulars) engaged and successfully held
                            four-fifths of the Iraqi armed forces — for brief periods, even larger
                            proportions of the government's strength. Most of the Kurds in
                            responsible government positions either were ousted for security reasons
                            or resigned; hundreds of Kurds, including two general officers, defected
                            to the Kurdish side.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d310-09" facs="d310-09"/>
                        <p>The drain of the inconclusive civil war was one cause of public and army
                            disaffection with a succession of Iraqi regimes during this decade,
                            hence an important reason for their rapid turnover. Coup plotters
                            necessarily took Kurdish affairs into account and Kurdish leaders into
                            their confidence: for the first time in Iraqi history, Kurds took a
                            direct part in making and unmaking national governments. Thus when the
                            Kurds promise potential backers that they will help bring down the Iraq
                            government, they have the warrant of having indeed done so, although
                            never single-handedly.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">External Contacts</p>
                        <p>Aid and Supply — Obviously, the Kurds could not have sustained nine years
                            of civil war without outside assistance. Virtually all of the aid they
                            received came from, or through, Iran — at first as private donations
                            from fellow Kurds across the nearly unpoliced Iranian border. Later,
                            when the Shah feared a weak neighboring government dominated by NASSER,
                            it became an open secret that Iran was providing training, materiel, and
                            medical services. Mulla Mustafa agreed, in return, not to recruit or
                            agitate among Iranian Kurds, and scrupulously kept his word. The Iraq
                            government insisted against all assurances that, because of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> relationship, this activity must be
                            taking place with US consent if not participation, and this conviction
                            prejudiced Iraq-US relations from about 1963 until they were broken off
                            during the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The Iraqis also suspected the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, because of its oil interests, and
                            Israel, for obvious reasons, of supplying the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>Although Mulla Mustafa seems sincerely to prefer Western aid, he was and
                            is willing to take help from any source. According to a long-time
                            friend, Mustafa, while attending the Soviet military academy during his
                            exile, was assigned a project to design a road and communications net
                            linking Iraqi Kurdistan with Soviet Armenia across northern Iran, and
                            was encouraged to believe that a Kurdish revolt would have Soviet
                            support. In December 1960 - January 1961 (seven months before
                            hostilities began), Mustafa went to Moscow and pleaded the cause of
                            Kurdish nationalism before a Communist Party meeting. The Soviets,
                            busily cultivating a newly-leftist Iraq government, then rebuffed him.
                            However in 1963, when the Ba'th had come to power and was persecuting
                            Iraqi communists, the Soviets bought safe-haven in Kurdish-held
                            territory for communist escapees from the south in return for two or
                            three plane loads of light arms. In the main, the Soviets, like the US,
                            treated the conflict as a domestic affair, meanwhile urging the Baghdad
                            government to be more flexible and consistent in seeking a solution.
                            Mulla Mustafa, on his part, feels he was used and betrayed by the
                            Soviets and thoroughly distrusts them. <pb n="10" xml:id="d310-10" facs="d310-10"/>Political Efforts — From late 1962 through 1965 the
                            Kurdish leadership tried by every means to internationalize their
                            quarrel and to attract outside political as well as material support.
                            They employed the services of Kurdish expatriates resident abroad and
                            travelling emissaries, both accredited by personal letters as
                            representatives of Mustafa. Ismet Sharif Vanly, head of a Kurdish
                            student organization in Europe, travelled widely on that continent and
                            twice visited the US. In 1964. Vanly presented an appeal to the
                            International Red Cross in Geneva, and in June 1965 he unsuccessfully
                            sought access to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the Kurdish
                            cause.</p>
                        <p> Mulla Mustafa's emissaries kept in close contact with the US through, at
                            first, the US Consulate in Tabriz, Iran, and later the Embassies in
                            Tehran, Baghdad, and Beirut. Mustafa addressed at least two letters to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and several to
                            the Shah of Iran. Private contacts in the US included Justice William O.
                            Douglas, several members of Congress, and heads of several Zionist
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>During the truce of 1963-64, the US attempted to arrange PL-480 relief
                            for the Kurds in the form of reconstruction work projects for food. CARE
                            was to be the supervising agency. The Iraq government, however, impeded
                            the delivery of this relief and succeeded in misdirecting most of it to
                            pro-government Kurds only. Because the safeguards required by law could
                            not be arranged, these projects had to be discontinued.</p>
                        <p>Disunity in Unity — Even during the height of the uprising, Kurdish unity
                            was never absolute. Some Kurdish mercenary irregulars fought on the
                            government side throughout the intermittent war; some entire tribes and
                            sub-tribes changed sides from time to time. Other families reinsured
                            their fortunes by having a branch stay neutral, or one on each side of
                            the conflict. At its largest, following a meeting at Koi Sanjaq in May
                            1963, the rebel confederation comprised all of the important tribal
                            groups as well as the leftist, urban,and politically-oriented Democratic
                            Party of Iraqi Kurdistan (DPIK), and the smaller northern minorities,
                            (Yezidis, Turcomans, etc.), and was directed by a quasi-government
                            "Revolutionary Command Council,” on which representatives of the Syrian
                            Kurds also sat. There was more or less constant tension, however,
                            between the politicized urban element, of which the leading figures were
                            Ibrahim Ahmad and Jalal Talabani, and the traditional tribal aghas
                            typified by Mulla Mustafa. This animosity — essentially a contest to
                            control the shape of the settlement and of post-war Kurdish society —
                            broke into the open shortly after Koi Sanjaq. A long truce with the
                            government (1964-65) was punctuated by sharp skirmishes between these
                            two factions. Mustafa won, and Talabani later returned to the fold. <pb n="11" xml:id="d310-11" facs="d310-11"/>On at least two occasions,
                            apparently with Iranian advice, the Kurds have also been in touch with
                            the alienated, socially and religiously conservative Shia, trying
                            unsuccessfully to raise a second front in southern Iraq.</p>
                        <p>The War Winds Down. Although a ceasefire was reached in February 1964,
                            with an exchange of terms promising a negotiated settlement to follow,
                            the agreed arrangements were never fully honored by either side. The
                            Kurds kept most of their arms; the government continued to hold Kurdish
                            prisoners it had promised to release, and never paid all of the
                            reparations it had agreed to. The Kurds have continued to petition the
                            government from time to time about the unfinished business of
                            settlement, but Kurdish affairs have remained at a stalemate. The last
                            sharp fighting occurred in 1965, and ended with Iraqi forces occupying
                            heights commanding the trails by which the Pesh Merga had been receiving
                            supplies from Iran.</p>
                        <p>A sullen and uneasy truce followed until, on March 11, 1970, the Iraq
                            government unilaterally proposed a peace agreement that contained much
                            of what the Kurds had asked for. Although the Kurds readily agreed to
                            these terms, only some of the cultural provisions have been actually
                            carried out, and in September 1971 agents personally accountable to
                            Iraqi strongman <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">SADDAM HUSAYN
                                AL</persName>-<persName>Tikriti</persName> attempted to assassinate
                            Mustafa by planting explosives in his automobile, having earlier fired
                            on his son, Idris. Given this long history of broken agreements, each
                            side is deeply distrustful of the other.</p>
                        <p>Among the still-unfilled conditions of settlement the most important in
                            Kurdish eyes are:</p>
                        <p>1) Delimitation of the Kurdish area, including portions, to be determined
                            by plebiscite, of Kirkuk province.</p>
                        <p>2) A Kurdish Vice President in the central government. (The Kurds also
                            want representation on the Revolutionary Command Council, the
                            government's actual decision-making body.)</p>
                        <p>3) A national census to determine Kurdish representation in any future
                            legislature.</p>
                        <p>4) Control of security forces in the designated Kurdish area. This demand
                            is again being pressed, following a rash of false arrests and
                            counter-kidnappings last summer. The Kurds have also demanded safeguards
                            against Iraq's union with any other Arab country or countries. </p>
                        <p>Deteriorating relations with neighboring Iran have also depressed
                            relations between the government and the Kurds. Suspecting that Iran was
                            plotting a coup against the Ba'th, and infuriated at Iranian <pb n="12" xml:id="d310-12" facs="d310-12"/>seizure of some small islands in
                            the Gulf in 1971, Iraq has conspired to raise trouble in the
                            predominantly Arab-populated province of Khuzistan in southern Iran, and
                            has expelled about 60,000 Iraqi residents of Iranian origin. The Iraq
                            government says that it asked the Kurds, as an earnest of peaceful
                            intentions, to cut off all contact with Iran. The Kurds claim that the
                            government asked them to raise a revolt among Iranian Kurds, which they
                            refused to do. Whichever version is true, this issue has become a major
                            cause of the latest ill feeling.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Even for Kurds, Not Always a Way</p>
                        <p> Mulla Mustafa is not likely to join in a National Front with the Iraqi
                            communists and the Ba'th, as he is being pressured to do. The Kurds have
                            little to gain and much to lose by that course. There remains the
                            question of whether to resume fighting, and on this the Kurds are
                            divided. The DPK might vote to accept a government subsidy that has
                            allegedly been offered, and subside for the time being, still
                            maintaining its demands and its latent animosity toward the central
                            government. More likely, if he can obtain the outside help he needs from
                            Iran or elsewhere — and there is a good chance that he can because of
                            uneasiness over the new Iraqi-Soviet treaty — Mustafa will call out his
                            Pesh Merga and reopen hostilities.</p>
                        <p> Mulla Mustafa is 69 years old; he sees the goals that his people fought
                            for and almost attained slipping away unless he can force some
                            substantial political gains in what may be his last campaign. He
                            probably also foresees that if he declines this challenge, his personal
                            leadership is doomed. The Iraq government well knows that Mulla Mustafa
                            is the only Kurdish leader who can unite his people to the point of
                            armed insurgency. If assassination fails, as it did last year, the
                            government will seek other ways to undercut and destroy him. Reportedly,
                            its agents are already paying and arming
                                anti-<persName>Barzani</persName> tribes, and trying to bribe the
                            Pesh Merga individually to lay down their arms. Also, the government is
                            treating with Jalal Talabani, Mustafa's younger rival during the last
                            insurgency, who talks of social reform in a communist vocabulary
                            (although he probably is not a communist), and whose vision of the
                            future of Kurdistan doubtless conforms much more to the style of the
                            present regime. By giving precedence to and working through Kurds of
                            this type, the government eventually can wean away much of Mustafa's
                            following, given conditions of peace.</p>
                        <p>A stumbling block of unknown proportion in any Kurdish plans to resume
                            the conflict is the war-weariness of the Kurdish people themselves, who
                            have had a little over five years of relative peace to begin to recover
                            from four years of hard fighting, and who cannot be eager to take up
                            arms again. A correspondent for Le Monde who explored Kurdish views
                            early in April 1972 found younger, urban Kurds saying that they have
                            already won better conditions than any of the neighboring Kurdish
                            groups, even if not all they wished, <pb n="13" xml:id="d310-13" facs="d310-13"/>and that to go to war new would risk missing out on
                            Soviet-aided development plans which are already beginning to accelerate
                            the economy in the rest of Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Having at last achieved better relations with Iran, and invested a great
                            deal in the present government of Iraq, the Soviets cannot wish the
                            Kurds to stir up trouble in either direction. They would strive, through
                            a combination of pressure and bribery, to induce the Kurds to settle
                            down and conform to the government's plans. Having gone so far as to
                            make direct approaches in the matter, however, the Soviets would be
                            almost forced to come in with advice and help on the government's side
                            if the Kurds do take up arms, at the risk of damaging Soviet relations
                            with Iran, with their own Kurds, and with national minorities elsewhere
                            that they might wish to champion. Reportedly, the Soviets foresaw
                            possible embarrassment of this sort when Iraqi leaders sought a treaty
                            relationship with them.</p>
                        <p>Should hostilities reopen, Mustafa and his following might at worst be
                            expelled from Iraq, or worn down in a longer and costlier struggle than
                            before. At best, he could achieve no more than the stalemate he reached
                            before, maintaining a hold on his northern mountain rim.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, a long-drawn-out insurgency might indeed bring down the
                            already unpopular Ba'th government, but it is by no means sure that the
                            Kurds could then determine the character of a successor regime. The
                            Iraqi exiles with whom they reportedly are planning do not offer, on
                            past performance, much chance of a stable and viable government.</p>
                        <p>Nor would they likely expel Soviet interests, since the entire Iraqi
                            military machine and much of the development plan are dependent on
                            Soviet assistance. Relations with the Soviets might, of course, be more
                            cautious, and the controversial treaty might become a dead letter. The
                            Soviets also could experience a backlash of public resentment from their
                            close identification with the unpopular Ba'th regime.</p>
                        <p>A complaisant pro-Ba'th or even pro-Soviet clique in control of Iraqi
                            Kurdistan could of course bring pressure on Iran and even create a
                            nuisance in eastern Turkey. Indeed, this seems to be one of the Iraqi
                            leaders', though not the Soviets', incentives in bringing matters to a
                            head in Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>

                            OIL NATIONALIZATION</p>
                        <p>Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. In a sudden and dramatic move on 1 June 1972, the Iraqi government
                            nationalized all the assets of the Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>), a consortium of US, British, Dutch,
                            and French oil firms operating in northern Iraq. The nationalization
                            culminates 11 years of smoldering disputes between the members of the
                            oil consortium and the Iraqi government. The same group of oil firms
                            also controls the only two other non-government oil-producing companies
                            in Iraq - the Mosul Petroleum Company (MPC) and the Basrah Petroleum
                            Company (BPC). These companies, which have less production than the
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, have not been affected by the
                            nationalization decree. In concert with the Iraqi move, the Syrian
                            government seized the Syrian portion of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> pipeline through which the oil produced in northern
                            Iraq is transported to ports on the eastern Mediterranean. This
                            memorandum describes the events leading up to the nationalization and
                            analyzes Iraq's ability to maintain output and sales of the newly
                            acquired oil. In addition, the possible repercussions on the Iraqi
                            economy and the world oil market resulting from the action are
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>Note: This memorandum was prepared by the Office of Economic Research and
                            coordinated within the Directorate of Intelligence.</p>
                        <p>Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>2. The source of the present conflict between Iraq and <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> is rooted in "Law 80" promulgated in
                            1961. From 1925 until 1961, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> held
                            concessions in Iraq covering virtually the entire country. This law
                            withdrew from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> all concession acreage
                            not then being worked by <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> companies -
                            an area amounting to more than 99% of the total. The canceled
                            concessions <pb n="2" xml:id="d311-02" facs="d311-02"/>included the
                            potentially prolific North Rumaila oilfield that <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> had discovered and partly developed, but from which
                            production had not yet begun. The companies refused to acknowledge the
                            validity of the law, and for more than a decade the dispute simmered.
                            Intermittent government-company discussions failed to resolve the issue.
                            In retaliation, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> refused to grant
                            Iraq the same financial benefits that other members of the Organization
                            of Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>)* were able to obtain in the mid-1960s, such as expensing
                            royalties. This action has led to an Iraqi claim for back payments of
                            nearly $400 million. Negotiations on the back payments claims and the
                            North Rumaila issue took place again in January and February 1972 but
                            ended in deadlock primarily because of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s adamant stand on compensation for the loss of the
                            North Rumaila oilfield.</p>
                        <p>[Footnote] * The member states of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            are: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Algeria, Libya,
                            Indonesia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>3. Tensions between <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and the
                            government were accentuated when oil production from the northern
                            oilfields dropped sharply during March, April, and early May 1972. The
                            Iraqis regarded this cutback as a further attempt to apply retaliatory
                            pressure against the government following the breakdown of negotiations
                            in February. By mid-May as the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) saw the serious downturn in government
                            oil receipts, which are vitally needed for political as well as economic
                            reasons, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> was threatened with
                            confiscatory legislation if the company did not increase production from
                            the northern oilfields, agree on a long-term production program, and
                            make a "positive offer" on the other outstanding issues. On 31 May,
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> agreed to increase production
                            from the northern oilfields and to set up a long-range production
                            program but continued to demand compensation for the loss of North
                            Rumaila. By then the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> had already
                            decided on the need for a dramatic political move, and Oil Minister
                            Hamadi rejected the proposal out-of-hand, insisting that Iraq would
                            never pay compensation for the North Rumaila field. The nationalization
                            law was adopted the next day.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has six shareholders: British
                            Petroleum (<gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>), Shell Petroleum, and

                            each with 23.75%; the two American oil companies, Mobil and Standard Oil
                            (New Jersey), are equal partners in the Near East Development
                            Corporation and jointly own another 23.75%; and the C.S. Gulbenkian
                            Estate owns the remaining 5%. The company's production comes mainly from
                            the Kirkuk oilfield in northern Iraq and is exported via pipeline across
                            Syria to the eastern Mediterranean ports of Banias in Syria and Tripoli
                            in Lebanon.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects for Iraq's Producing and Marketing the
                            Oil</p>
                        <p>5. Although production has apparently now been stopped on orders from
                            Baghdad, output could begin on short notice. Maintaining output from the
                            nationalized facilities and transporting the oil from the Kirkuk field
                            to the Mediterranean ports should pose no insurmountable problems for
                            the Iraqis. The operation of the northern fields is already almost
                            entirely in the hands of Iraqi nationals who are expected to remain
                            under the new ownership. The Syrians similarly should encounter little
                            difficulty operating the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            pipeline.</p>
                        <p>6. Production is not the problem, however. The most serious problem
                            facing the Iraqis is finding buyers. The companies comprising <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> control a large share of the world oil
                            market. It is unlikely that they would agree to market the nationalized
                            oil without an Iraqi commitment for prompt and adequate compensation.
                            Moreover, the companies will undoubtedly take steps to discourage any
                            other Western oil company from taking the oil. Legal action by the
                            French firms, <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> and Entreprise des
                            Recherches et d'Activities Petrolieres (<gloss target="#t_ERAP1">ERAP</gloss>), in their nationalization dispute with Algeria in
                            1971 and by British Petroleum after it had been nationalized in Libya
                            proved successful in preventing Algeria and Libya from marketing much of
                            their nationalized oil. The Basrah Petroleum Company, which still claims
                            the North Rumaila oilfield, also has threatened legal action against any
                            consignee of that oil, and as a result Iraq has met with only limited
                            success in marketing the small production from the North Rumaila
                            field.</p>
                        <p>7. Iraq's offer to give special consideration to <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> is clearly an effort to solve the marketing problems.
                                <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> is short of crude oil and could
                            make good use of the additional supply. However, <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss>, which is 35% French government owned, undoubtedly will
                            be subjected to intense political pressures from the other countries
                            involved. <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> probably will seek at
                            least the tacit approval of its partners in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> before entering negotiation with Iraq.</p>
                        <p>8. The Iraqis apparently have already turned to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for assistance in marketing the oil.
                            An Iraqi delegation headed by Foreign Minister Qadduri and including the
                            Director of Oil Affairs left for Moscow on 2 June, the day after the
                            nationalization occurred. Whether the Soviet Union will be able to offer
                            Iraq much assistance is doubtful. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is already heavily involved in operating the North
                            Rumaila oilfield, which began producing in April, and is taking a small
                            amount of Rumaila oil in repayment for its assistance. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might be reluctant or unable to
                            divert or charter enough tanker capacity to handle more than a fraction
                            of Iraq's northern oil production. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably could not <pb n="4" xml:id="d311-04" facs="d311-04"/>market a large amount of the oil
                            either domestically or in Eastern Europe especially in the short-term.
                            For its part the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is already a
                            substantial petroleum exporter. Soviet exports last year were some 2
                            million barrels per day (bpd) of which about 60% went to other Communist
                            countries. Moscow is not likely to use Iraqi oil to displace its own
                            sales particularly in the West where oil is the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s single largest foreign exchange earner. The Soviets
                            may, however, make some modest purchases of Iraqi oil. East European
                            imports from the West are quite modest — less than 200,000 bpd, most of
                            which comes from Iran and Egypt. Neither of these sources is likely to
                            be displaced by Iraqi oil.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect on World Oil Supply</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> production from the northern
                            oilfields in 1971 averaged about 1.1 million bpd - about 2% of world oil
                            production. Production by BPC from the southern Iraq oilfields was about
                            600,000 bpd in 1971. MPC has very small production from two fields in
                            the northwest. The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> companies, with
                            the exception of <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> and Gulbenkian,
                            should have only short-term dislocation problems in making up the
                            nationalized production. <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>, Shell, Esso,
                            and Mobil are all thoroughly integrated international companies with a
                            diversified source of crude oil. The production lost in Iraq can
                            probably be offset by increased output elsewhere in a relatively short
                            time. However, <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> obtains the largest
                            share of its crude oil supplies from Iraq, and this will probably make
                                <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> more disposed to working out a
                            marketing arrangement with Iraq. The Gulbenkian share is normally sold
                            through brokers.</p>
                        <p>10. The Iraqis chose a poor time to nationalize <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. The growth in oil demand in the main oil consuming
                            centers has been sluggish the last 18 months because of slow economic
                            growth in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, unusually high
                            stocks in Western Europe, and abnormally mild weather in many parts of
                            the world. Many oil-producing countries - notably Venezuela, Libya, and
                            Iraq itself — produced considerably below capacity during the first
                            quarter of 1972. At the same time, other oil producing countries -
                            notably Saudi Arabia and Iran — are implementing plans to increase
                            capacity greatly. Moreover, the tanker shortage that existed two years
                            ago prompted a widespread tanker building program with the result that
                            the tanker market now suffers from substantial excess capacity. During
                            the last two years, tanker capacity increased by about 30%, while
                            worldwide petroleum consumption increased by only about 17%. The
                            abundant supply of tanker capacity seriously weakens Iraq's bargaining
                            position vis-a-vis potential oil consumers. It is therefore likely that
                            the 1.1 million bpd from northern Iraq - actually about 650,000 bpd in
                            recent months - can be made up through an increase in long-haul voyages
                            from the Persian Gulf without serious disruption to the tanker market,
                            although some firming in short-term tanker rates is inevitable.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect on Iraq</p>
                        <p>11. Iraq is heavily dependent on its share of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> earnings which alone account for some 40% of government
                            revenues. Total government oil revenues from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, MPC, and BPC in 1972 were projected at roughly $1
                            billion, of which between $600 million and $700 million came from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> oil production in the north. Total
                            imports of goods and services run about $900 million a year, and Iraq's
                            foreign exchange earnings from sources other than <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> oil are about $500 million — $300
                            million from MPC and BPC. Thus the shortfall in import capacity if
                            exports of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> oil cease entirely will
                            be about $400 million a year, or 45% of total imports of goods and
                            services. Iraq has about $650 million in foreign exchange reserves —
                            some $200 million more than two years ago - which would cover the
                            maximum shortfall for 18 months.</p>
                        <p>12. Every effort, however, probably will be made by the government to
                            conserve its reserves. Baghdad already has taken austerity measures to
                            slow their decline. Import controls have been stiffened. Public sector
                            projects in the development program have been suspended for fiscal year
                            1972/73 (beginning 1 April) with the exception of those projects under
                            way. The Central Bank has severely limited issuance of foreign exchange
                            permits. These measures will temporarily halt Iraq's new and ambitious
                            development program, which was showing some progress, and probably stop
                            all economic growth. The situation would be eased, however, should Iraq
                            get financial support from some Arab countries as expected. Soviet
                            assistance is not likely to take the form of foreign exchange. Actually,
                            Iraq has been paying for Soviet arms in hard currency.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact on Syria</p>
                        <p>13. Syria's enthusiasm for Iraq's nationalizing <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and its own takeover of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> pipeline in its territory may wane if the dispute is a
                            protracted one. Unless the oil is marketed, Damascus stands to lose
                            about $82 million annually in transit and port dues that would have
                            accumulated on Iraq oil flowing through the Syrian portion of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> pipeline. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> dues accounted for about 14% of Syria's budget revenues
                            in 1970 and were expected to provide about 17% of revenues in the 1972
                            budget which is deeply in deficit. Loss of these revenues also would be
                            felt in Syria's balance of payments where they provided about 15% of the
                            earnings on current account in 1970.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect on Other Oil-Producing Countries</p>
                        <p>14. Iraq's nationalization of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> will
                            present deep problems for the individual members of the Organization of
                            Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>) of
                            which Iraq is a member. In recent months, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members have <pb n="6" xml:id="d311-06" facs="d311-06"/>worked toward achieving a degree of participation in the management of
                            the oil companies operating within their boundaries. After long
                            negotiations, the oil companies finally acceded to the principle of
                            participation. The specific method of implementing the 20% participation
                            is now being worked out but with very little progress reported so far.
                            The Iraq nationalization further complicates the issue of participation
                            and threatens to disassemble the hitherto united front put up by <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>15. In order for Iraq to exert maximum pressure on <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> to come to a relatively speedy
                            agreement, Baghdad will need the cooperation of other <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries. Specifically, the Iraqis
                            want these countries to prevent increases in their output that would
                            offset the decrease in Iraq's production. Although <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> has announced approval of the action
                            taken by Iraq, it is doubtful that there will be agreement to control
                            production. Libya and Algeria appear to be about the most willing to
                            help the Iraqis.</p>
                        <p>16. It is highly unlikely that Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two countries
                            who can most easily make up for any reduction in Iraq output, will be
                            willing to hold back on output. Output in those two countries has been
                            growing rapidly in recent years. It would be impossible to distinguish
                            the part of the increased production that would have occurred normally
                            from the part that is designed to offset Iraqi output.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>17. The Iraqi government has nationalized the major part of its oil
                            industry at a time when its negotiating position is extremely weak. Oil
                            demand currently is growing at a rate far below that of the two last
                            decades, tanker rates are near all-time lows, several countries are
                            producing well below capacity, and others are striving mightily to
                            substantially increase productive capacity. Production in the newly
                            nationalized field was considered less profitable by the oil producers
                            than oil that could be produced in the Persian Gulf, given recent market
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>18. Producing and transporting the nationalized oil should pose no
                            serious problems for Iraq. However, the oil companies comprising <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> will seek to prevent the nationalized
                            oil from reaching Western markets. Markets in the Communist countries,
                            on the other hand, can absorb only a small fraction of the approximately
                            1 million bpd of Iraqi oil normally exported from <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> fields. Conditions in the world oil
                            market are currently such that the oil companies could deprive Iraq of a
                            market for its oil by increasing output in other oil-producing
                            countries. To prevent this from happening, the cooperation of most of
                            the members of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> would be necessary.
                                <pb n="7" xml:id="d311-07" facs="d311-07"/>It is unlikely that such
                            cooperation will be forthcoming, particularly in the form of a
                            restriction on output. Therefore, Iraq likely will suffer a substantial
                            reduction in oil revenues for some time. The other members of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, particularly Libya and probably
                            Kuwait and some small Persian Gulf producers, will likely provide
                            financial support if Iraqi oil cannot be sold. But even on its own, Iraq
                            could stand a shutdown of its northern fields for years in view of its
                            substantial foreign exchange reserves, though at the cost of a slowdown
                            in economic growth.</p>

                        <p>Summary. The parent companies of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> are
                            unlikely to receive satisfactory compensation for their nationalized
                            properties, and will need our support to keep the Iraqi nationalization
                            from turning the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> participation
                            negotiations into a rout. This will mean giving our support to boycott
                            measures, as well as discouraging the French (or Italians, Japanese, or
                            others) from rushing in to fill <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s
                            position. The Iraqis will be under same financial pressure to settle,
                            and the extent of support they will be able to count on from their
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> colleagues is uncertain. As the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> participation measures move forward,
                            however, a strong line on <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> will be
                            untenable and ways should be examined to salvage some position in
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p> US Interests. The value of the American-owned share of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s nationalized properties, for which
                            they are unlikely to get satisfactory compensation, is probably no more
                            than $50 million. The oil production which Mobil and Jersey have lost
                            has recently been marginal because of its relatively high cost (a result
                            of the posted price settlements of last winter). It can be argued that
                            the companies brought about their current difficulties by their
                            stubbornness over the 1960 nationalization, and by their manipulation of
                            the production rates of the now nationalized fields; that they had
                            probably in any event written off anything but a most tenuous future in
                            Iraq; and that we should as a result offer them only minimum and pro
                            forma support so as to avoid further antagonizing the Iraqis or other
                            oil producers. While we agree that this argument has some merit, and
                            that we should avoid taking positions which identify the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> totally with the nationalized
                            companies, we believe that our interests in hinderring expropriations,
                            and in avoiding a rout of the companies in their dealings with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, dictate that we follow a policy of
                            consistent support for the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> owner
                            companies and parent governments in demanding and pressing for prompt
                            and adequate compensation.</p>

                        <p>Who Will Help the Iraqis? We can assume that the Iraqis will have
                            difficulty selling the nationalized oil, and that the owner companies
                            will use their market power to block sales to the west, at least
                            initially. The Iraqis will be hurt financially even if the southern
                            fields continue to operate and expand production—the potential losses
                            could be in the order of $40 million each month that sales cannot be
                            made. The Iraqis have received oral support from a variety of Arab
                            leaders, including a promise of full support frown Libya and a Kuwaiti
                            suggestion that <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> establish an
                            emergency fund to help countries under pressure; <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> has also announced formation of a
                            similar fund. How much support will be in the form of cash, however,
                            remains to be seen—Kuwait will almost certainly contribute, although
                            warily, to its northern neighbor, and Libya will do likewise in spite of
                            its dislike of Iraq's regime. Neither is likely to be overly generous,
                            however, and the Iraqi purse will be even shorter of cash than usual.
                            Syria and Lebanon, which will lose transit revenues, will also feel the
                            pinch until oil produced from the nationalized fields can be marketed in
                            quantity. In short, there will be considerable financial pressure on the
                            Iraqis to reach a new regularization of the situation.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> owners, through their continued
                            operations in south Iraq, will be able to affect the level of their
                            remaining payments to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> through
                            decisions on production levels. This lever could be used constructively,
                            to attempt to build some good faith for the compensation negotiations,
                            or negatively to punish the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. If the
                            companies attempt the latter, we believe it would be counterproductive.
                            Fortunately, their supply and economic interests probably dictate
                            increased production from the southern fields.</p>
                        <p>We have no reason to believe that the Soviets encouraged the Iraqi
                            nationalization or that they have promised any financial aid. The Iraqis
                            are capable of running the fields and pipelines with reasonable
                            efficiency and will need only limited technical aid. They will
                            undoubtedly ask the Soviets for aid in marketing the oil. We doubt
                            however if the Soviets will be willing or even able to market large
                            quantities of the nationalized oil. <pb n="3" xml:id="d312-03" facs="d312-03"/>Even though they have now agreed to market some
                            nationalized Libyan oil (from the <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>
                            concession), the small quantities involved, and the reportedly hard
                            bargain they drove with the Libyans, make it appear likely that they are
                            either unable or unwilling to underwrite the financial success of
                            nationalization measures by the oil producing states. They have
                            considerably more important economic and commercial relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> countries to consider.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> Situation. Saudi oil Minister Yamani has used the
                            Iraqis as a bogeyman against the companies in past, and will be able to
                            do so with mare conviction in future. More importantly, the Iraqi
                            nationalization will stiffen his position in the participation
                            negotiations; he cannot afford to be completely outflanked by the
                            radicals. The companies appear to suspect that the Iraqi move was
                            cleared, or at least acquiesced in by other <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members, particularly the Saudis. (We have no evidence
                            that this was the case; in fact there is some evidence that the Saudis
                            were not informed by the Iraqi intent to nationalize). The companies
                            will want to show as strongly as possible that nationalization is not a
                            workable alternative to negotiated changes in producer relationships.
                            They will ask for our support for boycott and other efforts to prove
                            this point. We will have to support them on this, or risk having the
                            participation negotiations degenerate into a charade. We should keep in
                            mind at the same time, however, that too close an identification with
                            the companies could prejudice our future capability to influence the
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> governments toward moderation,
                            should the occasion warrant.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> has called a special session June
                            9 to consider the Iraqi action, at which the Iraqis will request
                            support. Although <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> officers have
                            said previously that the organization does not advocate nationalization
                            as a policy, the meeting will almost certainly approve the Iraqi move
                            and may make some financial assistance available. Whether the members
                            will also support Iraq by restricting their own oil liftings is
                            considerably more questionable-some members, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran,
                            Abu Dhabi, and Nigeria are now counting on substantial production
                            increases to boost income and would be most reluctant to freeze or
                            restrict their growth. The Iranians moreover have no political interest
                            in supporting the Iraqis. <pb n="4" xml:id="d312-04" facs="d312-04"/>The
                            Arab oil producers, who meet in an <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> conference June 7 just before the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> one, will probably have to go
                            farther—at least verbally—-in their support of the Iraqi move. (The just
                            concluded Arab Oil Congress passed a motion of support). The moderates,
                            particularly,the Saudis will be caught between their desire to support
                            the Iraqis against the companies, their annoyance at having their role
                            in the participation negotiations upstaged, and their unwillingness to
                            support the Iraqis at the expense of their own expansion plans. They
                            will probably have to go along, however, with the wishes of the more
                            radical members of the group.</p>
                        <p>The French Connection. Although the French were offered a special
                            opportunity to come back by President <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> in his speech announcing the nationalization, the
                            French company (CEP) was treated no differently from the others in the
                            decree. Both the company and French government have announced that they
                            are "carefully examining" the Iraqi proposal, and would undoubtedly like
                            to profit from their closer past relationships with the Iraqis. If we
                            assume that the oil consortium has no chance of regaining its position,
                            then a French-led group would at least be preferable to total
                            Iraqi-Soviet development of this important oil concession. Although this
                            approach may be best for western interests in the long run, any rush
                            into it in the short run would seriously compromise the companies'
                            position in the participation negotiations. We should therefore seek to
                            restrain the French (or others) from precipitate acceptance of the Iraqi
                            overture, and will attempt to bring multilateral pressure to bear toward
                            this end in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Oil Committee
                            meetings next week. The British have in the meantime called a meeting
                            for June 8 of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> parent government
                            representatives to evaluate the situation. One of the goals of this
                            meeting will be to persuade the French that any weakening of the oil
                            companies' and consumers' ranks at this point will seriously damage the

                            participation is more clearly established, the companies will need our
                            support in resisting Iraqi efforts to make the nationalization a
                            success. As the participation negotiations move toward defining new
                            company-government relationships, however, a hard line on <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> will become irrelevant and perhaps
                            counterproductive. <pb n="5" xml:id="d312-05" facs="d312-05"/>Several
                            possibilities might then be explored to maintain some western position
                            in the area:</p>
                        <p>— The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> companies might (though the
                            possibility is slim) be able to capitalize on their continued position
                            in southern Iraq to reenter the northern area as a joint partner with
                            the Iraqis, in return for surrendering a joint partnership in the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>— The Iraqi invitation to the French could be converted into formation of
                            a new consortium (The Iranian settlement pattern of 1954). This could
                            involve participation by the French, Germans, Belgians, Italians same US
                            independents, and others (as well as the Iraqis), and would mean that
                            the present owners could realize some compensation from the
                            buyers-in.</p>
                        <p>There are probably other possibilities as well, but for the moment they
                            are all premature.</p>

                        <p>Dick <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> is the channel for the
                            following message to you from the Shah on the basis of his talk with you
                            in Tehran on the Kurdish situation:</p>
                        <p>The Shah believes you should talk personally with two Kurdish
                            representatives of <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah Mustafah
                                Barzani</persName> who will be travelling to the US shortly. After
                            you study their problem, the Shah 'expects' you to share with him your
                            views on the discussion. Given current Iraqi policies, the Shah believes
                            the Kurds should be protected from Communist influence and prevented
                            from following the same policies as those of the Iraqi government.
                                [<persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>' memo relaying this
                            message is at Tab A.]</p>
                        <p>The two emissaries will be [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The issue in your seeing these fellows is the possibility that they will
                            use their call on you to claim US support. Even if we were to decide to
                            help them, I would assume we would want our hand to be hidden.</p>
                        <p>The balance is fairly fine on the question of whether we should support
                            the Kurds.</p>
                        <p>The principal arguments for supporting them are:</p>
                        <p>—To permit or encourage them to remain a source of instability in Iraq,
                            thwarting the Soviet effort to promote a national unity government as a
                            sounder base for the Soviet position.</p>
                        <p>—The Iranians, Jordanians and the Israelis have intermittently over time
                            supported the Kurds as a means of tying down Iraqi forces at home, and
                            their security is our interest. In addition, there is now the prospect
                            of active Iraqi meddling down the Gulf which domestic <pb n="2" xml:id="d313-02" facs="d313-02"/>instability would help weaken.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The principal arguments against our supporting the Kurds are:</p>
                        <p>—We would be committing ourselves to a guerrilla effort, the greatest
                            success of which could be a standoff with the government in Baghdad and
                            preservation of Kurdish autonomy. If the battle turned against the
                            Kurds, we would have neither the assets nor the interest to provide
                            decisive support.</p>
                        <p>—The financial resources are really available in Saudi Arabia and Iran.
                            This is one case where the US should consult with the regional countries
                            which it is already supporting in a variety of ways and tell them
                            straightforwardly that we feel this should be a regional effort rather
                            than one for which we would provide direct support.</p>
                        <p>—One would have to consider the implications of supporting the Kurds in
                            the context of the Moscow summit talks. Since the Soviets have made an
                            effort recently to persuade the Kurds to join the Ba'ath Party in a
                            national unity government in Baghdad, support for the Kurds would be a
                            direct counter-Soviet move.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p> US policy for some time has been to avoid involvement in Kurdish
                            affairs. The latest approaches were made to [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] and to [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] during the President's visit to Tehran. The
                            response was to reiterate the line that we are not involved. State's
                            practice has been to receive travelling Kurds at the desk level. <pb n="3" xml:id="d313-03" facs="d313-03"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> does not have a proposal for action
                            now, so the issue is only whether you are to see the Kurdish emissaries
                            as the Shah requests. This depends heavily, of course, on how committed
                            you feel to the Shah on this particular point. My own feeling is that it
                            would be better not to involve you personally at this stage since that
                            comes so close to involving the President at least by implication. I
                            think you could tell the Shah this straightforwardly and say that you
                            will have me give them a full hearing and report. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> will have talked with them

                        <p>RECOMMENDATIONS:</p>
                        <p>1. That the following reply be sent to the Shah: "I am concerned that my
                            receiving the Kurdish emissaries could mislead them into excessive
                            expectations of direct US support which, as you know, there has been no
                            decision to provide. I will, however, ask my senior assistant on Middle

                        <p>1. On 5 June 1972 [<hi rend="italic">text not declassifed</hi>] wished an
                            immediate meeting. At the meeting [<hi rend="italic">text not

                            with the Shah who had several messages he wished transmitted [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Shah wished Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> to
                            convey the following message to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Referring to the Shah's recent talk with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on the Kurdish
                            situation, the Shah believes that Kurdish representatives of <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah Mustafah Barzani</persName> who will be
                            travelling to the United States should be received personally by Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. The Shah believes
                            that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> should listen
                            to what these representatives have to say and study their problem.
                            Following his talks with them, the Shah "expects" Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to share with the Shah his
                            views regarding these discussions. Given the current policies of the
                            Government of Iraq, he believes that the Kurds should be protected and
                            prevented from following the same policies as those of the Government of
                            Iraq. They should also be protected from Communist influence.</p>
                        <p>The Shah wished the following message to be passed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: Please receive the Kurdish
                            representatives, listen to them, study what they have to say and share

                        <p>3. BACKGROUND. In the past few years, the Government of Iran has raised
                            periodically the subject of United States support to Barzani. In
                            November 1971, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] raised
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] the possibility of
                            United States aid to Barzani, relating the question to the developing
                            national front government in Iraq. Based on guidance provided from
                            Washington, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] was told that
                            United States policy was to refrain from intervention in Kurdish
                            affairs. In March 1972 [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            proposed covert United States support to <persName>Barzani</persName>
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Again the United
                            States policy of nonintervention was confirmed. Later in March,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> sent a special representative, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], to London and Washington
                            to speak with prominent Iraqi exiles and with the British and United
                            States governments. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            During this trip, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] also
                            spoke with officials of the Department of State at the country desk
                            level [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] In April 1972
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> sent another special
                                representative,[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], to
                            the United States to solicit official an private support for the Kurds.
                            In May, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] proposed that
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] meet with you or with
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> during
                            tie President's visit to Iran. This proposal was turned down on the
                            grounds of insufficient time. [<hi rend="italic">text not

                            POSITION IN THIS CASE NOW CLEAR. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN AT THIS POINT
                            SHOULD BE TO ISOLATE IRAQI ACTION, TO EXTENT POSSIBLE, FROM MIDDLE EAST
                            AND OPEC POLITICS WHILE MAINTAINING SUPPORT FOR PRINCIPLE PROMPT AND
                            ADEQUATE COMPENSATION.</p>

                            DEGREE OF ARAB AND OPEC SUPPORT, WE BELIEVE IT ESSENTIAL THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> OR OTHER PARENT GOVERNMENTS AVOID STEPS
                            WHICH WOULD CRYSTALLIZE SITUATION OR PROVOKE SHARPER CONFRONTATION. THIS

                            OF IRAQ BY PRODUCTION CUTBACKS, MASSIVE FINANCIAL AID OR OTHER STEPS. WE

                            CHANNELS WITH IRAQIS OPEN AND BUSY. WE BELIEVE THIS STRATEGY CAN BUY
                            TIME FOR ORDERLY PURSUIT OF OPEC PARTICIPATION NEGOTIATIONS, WHILE AT
                            SAME TIME KEEPING IRAQI ACTION FROM BEING SUCCESSFUL, AND CONSEQUENTLY

                        <p>1. The following is for your background information in connection with
                            the forthcoming meeting which you General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> will have with representatives of the Kurdish
                            leader, Mulla Mustafa Barzani. An edited version of this is being
                            prepared for General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Kurdish Situation in Brief</p>
                        <p>2. The increasingly close relationship between the Soviet Union and the
                            Ba'thist Government of Iraq, and concomitant pressure by the Soviets and
                            the Ba'thists to induce the Iraqi Kurds to join a national unity
                            government in Baghdad, have given rise to Kurdish claims that without
                            financial aid from some source to pay <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            Kurdish forces, the Pish Mirga, plus western, particularly U.S., "moral"
                            support to counter Soviet backing of the Iraqi Bath, the Iraqi Kurds may
                            be forced into an accommodation with their adversaries.</p>
                        <p>3. The Shah of Iran is concerned that Iraq is progressively falling under
                            Soviet domination with implications for Iranian security and Iranian and
                            western interests in the Persian Gulf. He therefore is seeking ways to
                            minimize Soviet influence on Iran's flank and in this connection
                            believes it desirable that <persName>Barzani</persName> remain
                            sufficiently viable to maintain his resistance to the Ba'thist regime in
                            Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>4. Principally because of the above factors, in recent months both
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>, on behalf of the Shah, have intensified their
                            efforts to obtain western support, particularly U.S. and British moral
                            backing as a counterweight to the Soviet support of the Ba'thists. <pb n="2" xml:id="d315-02" facs="d315-02"/>Although Mulla Mustafa claims
                            he will keep secret any commitment of U.S. moral support, such a
                            commitment would be of little use to him if he could not exploit it to
                            gain backing, and this would mean letting it become known.</p>
                        <p>5. The Kurdish desire for financial support has practical foundations.
                            The subsidy granted by the Baghdad Government after the civil war ended
                            in 1970 has been terminated recently and the [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] Iranian subsidies provided
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> prior to the end of that war were
                            greatly reduced when the Ba'thist subsidy took effect. As a result, in
                            recent months, <persName>Barzani</persName> has had to reduce sharply
                            the salaries of his forces and many have faded away. We estimate
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> needs about $7,200,000 annually just to

                            proposed to increase his troops to 50,000 men, for which salary support
                            would run about $24,000,000 per year. Material and arms would, of

                        <p>6. In November 1971 [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] of
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] reviewed [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] the possibiliy of U.S. aid
                            to <persName>Barzani</persName>, relating the question to the developing
                            national front government in Iraq. Based on guidance from the Department
                            of State, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] was told that
                            U.S. policy was to refrain from in intervention in Kurdish affairs. In
                            March 1972 [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] proposed
                            covert U.S. assistance to <persName>Barzani</persName>, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Again the U.S. policy of
                            non-interference was confirmed, not only by the State Department but by
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s office as well.
                            Later, in March <persName>Barzani</persName> sent a special
                            representative, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], to [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and Washington to speak
                            with the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and U.S.
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>7. While in Washington, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            asked [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], to use his
                            influence to obtain a covert expression of U.S. support for
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. During your meeting with [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], he mentioned the
                            situation in Iraq and the two dissident groups he was in touch with. You
                            replied that in general you shared his views of the Iraq situation. You
                            noted, however that the U.S. could not involve itself directly. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>

                        <p>9. During his trip in April, [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] also met with Department of State officials [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Additionally, in April
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> sent another special representative,
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], to the U.S. to
                            solicit official and private support for the Kurds. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] has been in touch with Senator Gravel's
                            office most recently. In May, [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] proposed that <persName>Barzani</persName>'s [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] meet with Secretary of

                            to Iran. This proposal was turned down on the grounds of insufficient
                            time. Subsequently, the Shah through [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>]requested that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and yourself receive representatives from
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. The Shah also asked for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s and your reaction to such a
                            meeting. A message has been sent to the Shah stating that you and.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> will together
                            receive the <persName>Barzani</persName> representatives if they come to

                        <p>In taking a close look at the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            nationalization and reducing it to its essentials in terms of key U.S.
                            interests, I have come up with the following analysis:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Immediate Effects on U.S. Interests.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> nationalization action by itself
                            and thus far has had no appreciable effect on U.S. interests. It does
                            not affect appreciably the U.S. balance of payments position; it does
                            not hurt Western Europe by depriving it of oil; and it does not, at
                            least for the moment, appreciably serve Soviet interests.</p>
                        <p>While it is difficult to estimate how much in the way of ESSO-Mobil
                            profits have flowed into the U.S. annually from the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> operation, the annual amount is a very
                            small portion of the some $2 billion which is annually repatriated
                            altogether by U.S. oil companies. With regard to Western Europe, only
                            ten per cent of its consumption on an average, comes from Iraq, and only
                            six per cent is drawn from the nationalized Kirkuk fields. This loss can
                            easily be made up by other oil producing countries, especially Iran. As
                            for the Soviets, they are presumably not keen to have IPC deprived of
                            its European markets because the Soviet Union cannot make up the
                            difference and it is in Soviet interests to assure an economically
                            healthy Iraq. Also, at the moment, there is no indication that the
                            Soviets are pressing the Iraqis to allow them to exercise control over
                            these facilities, as is occurring in the former <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>-owned North Rumaila field in the south.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Longer Range Implications</p>
                        <p>While the immediate effects of the Iraqi action on U. S. interests are
                            insignificant, the longer range implications are considerable. The
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> nationalization action could
                            affect our other oil interests in the area by inducing other Arab
                            producers similarly to nationalize. If this happened, our balance of
                            payments position would be seriously affected; European oil needs would
                            be jeopardized (although consumption imperatives would probably overcome
                            the oil company boycott); <pb n="2" xml:id="d316-02" facs="d316-02"/>and
                            Soviet interests in the area would be advanced insofar as the
                            dispossession of the American oil companies represents a reduction of
                            important Western influence in the area.</p>
                        <p>Widespread nationalization could happen if Iraq's example turns out to be
                            a great success or if we and other Western powers so antagonize the
                            other Arab oil producers that they decide to follow suit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Principal Concerns and Objectives</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, our principal concerns are: (1) that nationalization not
                            spread and (2) that Western firms not be excluded from the former <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> operation.</p>
                        <p>In consonance with these concerns, our objectives should be, first, to
                            avoid actions which make the Iraqi action profitable or really
                            successful. This means keeping as tight a rein as possible on the French
                            to make sure that the French do not make too attractive an offer to the
                            Iraqis with regard to follow-up arrangements(*), bearing in mind that
                            the Iraqis need the European market badly. This also means refraining
                            from taking punative measures against Iraq because such actions by any
                            of the Western powers risks closing Arab ranks and inducing other Arab
                            oil producers to line up with Iraq—for example, by agreeing to finance
                            any Iraqi deficit flowing from the nationalization action.</p>
                        <p>[footnote] (*) i.e. an arrangement with the Iraqis which among other
                            things undercuts their British, Dutch and U.S. partners.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we should avoid actions which drive Iraq further into the
                            Soviet embrace. This means keeping a French-European follow-on option
                            open to the Iraqis, so that the Iraqis are not forced either to turn the
                            installations over to Soviet control or to become dependent on the
                            Soviets for locating markets. Our approach to the French will have to be
                            a kind of balancing act: on the one hand, we would like the French to
                            keep a foot in the door but, on the other hand, we don't want them to
                            accept such attractive terms that the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> nationalization will have paid off.</p>

                            RELFECTED IN JUNE 7 ARTICLE BY IZVESTIYA POLITICAL OBSERVER KUDRYAVTSEV.
                            CLAIMING TO HAVE INTERVIEWED LEADERS OF ALL THREE POLITICAL FORCES,
                            KUDRYAVTSEV DELICATELY ADVISED BAATH PARTY THAT IT CANNOT ACHIEVE
                            DESIRED REFORMS UNLESS IT COOPERATES WITH IRAQI CP AND KURDS. HE
                            DIRECTED MAJOR CRITICISM, HOWEVER, AT "POLITICIANS" WHO PERMIT "MINOR
                            QUESTIONS" TO BLOCK IRAQI NATIONAL FRONT. IN IDEOLOGICAL LECTURE WHICH
                            APPEARS LARGELY DIRECTED AT IRAQI CP, KUDRYAVTSEV ADMONISHED
                            "POLITICIANS" TO ACCEPT FACT THAT "BAATH PARTY IS IN POWER" AND URGED
                            COOPERATION WITH IRAQ'S RULING PARTY, RECALLING LENIN'S ADVICE TO

                        </list>
                        <p>Dick <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> has sent the attached
                            background memorandum for the talk which you and he will have with the
                            Kurdish emissaries. I assume he is in touch with you on the timing.</p>
                        <p>The attached is so easily read that I will not summarize it here. The
                            most useful thing I can do is to point out the main considerations that
                            would go into a decision for providing some of the $1.5 million monthly
                            subsidy or "moral support" that the Kurdish leaders are looking for:</p>
                        <p>—The major view in town is that we should stay out of direct support for
                            the Kurds. As <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> understands
                            it, the Iranian/ intelligence service has already committed the Iranians
                            to paying half of the subsidy [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] In short, there is enougH money in the area to do
                            this and this is one case where we could well leave this effort to local
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>—The second major point to consider is that what the Kurds really want to
                            do is to get from the US some indication of support that they can noise
                            around the Middle East. So anything we do in the way of "moral support"
                            cannot by its nature stay quiet because if it were to do
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> any good he would have to tell others.
                            This would put us semi-openly into one of the longest ongoing guerrilla
                            wars in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>—On the other hand, there is a certain attraction to trying to help the
                            Kurds maintain some independence of the Iraqi government so that they
                            can keep the Soviets from helping the Baath party consolidate its rule
                            and relationship with the Communists in Iraq. However, admitting the
                            desirability of any reasonable effort to thwart the Soviets, the
                            question remains whether US support is essential to the success of the
                            effort. The Kurds have kept their position with Iranian and [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] <pb n="2" xml:id="d318-02" facs="d318-02"/>support for a number of years, and the US could well
                            take the position that this is a case for the regional countries most
                            interested to continue. If we provide moral support, perhaps it should
                            be in the form of acknowledged acquiescence expressed directly to them
                            rather than to support for the Kurds.</p>
                        <p>Your main purpose in seeing these fellows will be simply to hear them out
                            and to enable Henry to send some reflections back to the Shah after
                            hearing their case.</p>
                        <p>I might add that I have had several feelers from some of these Kurdish
                            emissaries and so far have turned them aside. If you would like, I would
                            be glad to go with you to this meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> and these emissaries.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Through arrangements made by the Shah of Iran,[<hi rend="italic">text
                                not declassified</hi>], personal representatives of Kurdish leader
                            Mulla Mustafa Barzani, met on 30 June 1972 with Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Richard Kennedy</persName>, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officer [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] The substance of that meeting is covered in this
                            memorandum. Additional background information and details to support the
                            Kurdish requests for assistance are attached herewith as provided to
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives by [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] during extensive
                            discussions on 1 July 1972.</p>
                        <p>2. As the primary spokesman for the visitors, [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] opened the 30 June meeting by conveying the
                            personal greetings of Mulla Barzani to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and the American people. He
                            expressed <persName>Barzani</persName>'s appreciation for this
                            long-sought opportunity to present the Kurdish case directly to the
                            United States Government and invited complete frankness on the part of
                            both sides. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] then provided
                            a short historical review of the Kurdish movement and its fight for
                            autonomy within Iraq. He followed with a geopolitical description of
                            Kurdistan's position as the only remaining obstacle to total Soviet
                            control of Iraq and the resultant implications to other countries in the
                            area, particularly Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the Persian
                            Gulf states. He spoke in some detail concerning joint Soviet and Iraqi
                            efforts to bring the Kurds under the control of the Ba'thi regime in
                            Baghdad. He noted in particular the intensification of direct Soviet
                            political pressures on Kurdish leaders, including visits to Mulla
                            Barzani by leading members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
                            and the German Democratic Republic. [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] reported on Soviet demands to Mulla Barzani in
                            late June 1972 for prompt replies to previous Soviet overtures for the
                            Kurds to join a National Front Government in Iraq. He pictured the
                            Soviet effort as a supplement to Iraqi economic, military, and terrorist
                            activities aimed at destroying <persName>Barzani</persName> and the
                            political leadership of the Iraqi Kurds. [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] said that <persName>Barzani</persName> and other
                            Kurdish leaders do no believe that they can resist this combination of
                            Soviet and Iraqi pressure for much more than six months without
                            significant foreign assistance. If such aid is not forthcoming, the
                            Kurds believe that within six months they will either have to reach a
                            political compromise with the Iraqi <pb n="2" xml:id="d319-02" facs="d319-02"/>central government or fight to a sure defeat.</p>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] stressed that
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> wishes increased foreign assistance not
                            just to defend his area from the Soviets and Iraqis, but preferably to
                            make Kurdistan a positive element on the side of the United States and
                            its friends and allies in the Middle East, notably Turkey, Iran, Israel,
                            Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the Persian Gulf states. Further, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] explained Mulla Barzani's
                            conviction that the Soviets are now controlling events in Iraq and that
                            time is running out for the West and its allies bordering that country.
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> believes that Kurdistan, albeit small,
                            could exploit its strategic location and fighting potential as an
                            effective tool in a free world effort to reverse the trend of Soviet
                            expansion in the Middle East and to regain the initiative for the free
                            world and its allies in that area. In this context, he noted that Iraqi
                            oil resources are located primarily in the Kurdish area. A strong
                            Kurdistan could thus be a major voice in the oil policies of the Iraqi
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] specified that in the
                            context outlined above, <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Mullah
                                Barzani</persName> sought United States political, financial,
                            military, and intelligence assistance as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Recognition of the Kurdish objective of autonomy and the continuance
                            of direct secret contacts between the Kurdish movement and the American
                            Government;</p>
                        <p>b. Financial support sufficient to turn the Kurds into an offensive
                            military force with the objective of either bringing down the Ba'thi
                            Government in Baghdad or at least tying up the majority of Iraqi
                            military forces in indefinite combat in order to eliminate the Iraqi
                            regime as a Soviet-controlled threat to American and free world
                            interests and allies in the area;</p>
                        <p>c. Provision of military assistance;</p>
                        <p>d. Establishment of an intelligence liaison between the Kurds and the
                            United States, to include provision of assistance to Kurdish
                            intelligence.</p>
                        <p>5. In presenting the request above for continuing direct contact between
                            their leadership and the United States Government, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] said that Mulla Barzani recommends [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] presence, temporary or
                            permanent, in Haj Umaran, <persName>Barzani</persName>'s [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. As an alternative, the
                            Kurdish movement would accept a contact in any feasible location as
                            preferred by the United States Government. [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] commented that <pb n="3" xml:id="d319-03" facs="d319-03"/> Mulla Barzani, in turn, looks forward to visiting
                            the United States whenever political conditions would so permit. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] stressed that in return
                            for the American assistance requested above, Mulla Barzani was prepared
                            to commit his movement and his fighting forces to the policies of the
                            United States Government. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            added that prior to their departure from Washington, he and [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] would provide the
                            background and details for their requests to [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] (see attachments).</p>
                        <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] completed his
                            presentation by saying that he felt Mulla Barzani's concerns and
                            requests above were very relative to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s reference in his press
                            conference of 29 June to the threat to world peace represented by Soviet
                            adventures in the Middle East. [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] said that the current Soviet-Iraqi effort to
                            control Kurdistan would be the final chapter in the Soviet adventure of
                            turning Iraq into a satellite state, which in turn would threaten
                            American interests in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] noted that he and [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] carried with them a tiger
                            skin from Kurdistan as a gift for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> from Mulla Barzani. He said he would send this
                            gift to the Director to forward to the President on behalf of the
                            Kurdish leader. He closed by saying that Mulla Barzani hoped that the
                            arrival of his representatives in Washington so close to America's
                            celebration of its independence on 4 July would encourage the United
                            States Government to respond positively to this Kurdish appeal for
                            assistance in maintaining Kurdish independence.</p>
                        <p>8. Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> thanked [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] for their visit to
                            Washington and commended [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            for his most able presentation of the position and requirements of the
                            Kurdish people and their leadership. He said that he and Colonel
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> have been authorized
                            by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to express the
                            sympathy of the United States Government for the Kurdish movement under
                            Mulla Barzani. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> noted
                            that the very presence of the Kurdish representatives in his office was
                            proof of our position and readiness to consider their requests for
                            assistance. The Director said that the United States Government desires
                            to continue the relationship with the Kurdish movement which had been
                            officially initiated by the presentation of [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>9. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d319-04" facs="d319-04"/>
                        <p>10. The Director then asked [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>] to provide [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] with the details of the Kurdish financial and
                            military needs as quickly as possible so the United States Government
                            could consider them promptly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> recognized that time is critical for the Kurds and
                            that our Government would make every effort to decide what it could do
                            and then provide such assistance as quickly as possible. He indicated
                            that the United States Government's response would be conveyed to Mulla
                            Barzani through [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] which we
                            would arrange. Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                            cautioned that it would be very difficult for the United States to
                            provide military equipment directly to Kurdistan without American
                            involvement becoming public knowledge. He suggested that we might have
                            to consider channeling any such aid through the [<hi rend="italic">text
                                not declassified</hi>] or Iranian governments. The Director
                            stipulated that secrecy would be an absolute requirement in this new
                            relationship and that the relationship could indeed be soured by a
                            failure to honor our need for such secrecy.</p>
                        <p>11. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] responded that the
                            Kurdish leadership understood our requirement for secrecy and was ready
                            to carry out all arrangements exactly as desired by our side and to
                            handle all of our aid and assistance exactly as we dictated. He noted as
                            an indication of the good faith in this respect that only the Iranian
                            Government was aware of the Kurdish visit to Washington. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>12. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> expressed Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s appreciation for
                            the excellent presentation which gave us a clearer perception of the
                            precarious position of Kurdistan and of its potential to play a role in
                            the Middle East. He also commended [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] for an outstanding presentation on behalf of
                            Mulla Barzani. The meeting then ended with an agreement that the
                            visitors would meet further with [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] to provide the details to support their general
                            presentation to the Director and Colonel <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>The primary goal of the Kurdish movement (people) in Iraq is autonomy for
                            the Kurdish area of that country. The autonomy desired is comparable to
                            the autonomy of a state in the United States with its control of
                            education and other basic social services to its citizens. It is not in
                            any degree comparable to full independence. A secondary goal of the
                            movement is to promote democracy as the political system of government
                            in Iraq.</p>
                        <p>The most important political aspect of Kurdish relations with any
                            government, including the central government of Iraq, is, therefore, the
                            recognition by that government of Kurdish autonomy within the
                            independent republic of Iraq as legitimate, legal, and acceptable.</p>
                        <p>This autonomy was first recognized in the "Christmas Declaration" of 24
                            December 1922, in which the British specifically recognized Kurdish
                            autonomy and granted the Kurds the authority to govern their areas.
                            Unfortunately, this declaration was never recognized in practice by the
                            British and Iraqi Arabs, which in turn led to a succession of Kurdish
                            revolts. The aim of the Kurds during such fighting was to gain
                            recognition in practice for the legal official autonomy formally granted
                            to them in the "Christmas Declaration”.</p>
                        <p>After the Qasim coup d'etat of 14 July 1958, the Iraqi Government
                            promulgated a provisional constitution, Article 3 of which recognized
                            that the Kurds and Arabs would be partners in governing the nation. This
                            was never acknowledged in practice, however, and by 1961 'Abd-al-Karim
                            had, in fact, begun a major effort to crush the Kurdish movement. He
                            closed the offices of the Kurdish Democratic Party (the political
                            organization representing the Kurdish movement), shut down the Party's
                            newspapers, sent Iraqi troops into Kurdistan, and tried to settle Arab
                            tribes in the Kurdish areas.</p>
                        <p>In response to these actions, Mulla Mustafa Barzani organized a Kurdish
                            resistance effort in 1961 with only 600 armed men. By 1963 the
                            movement's objective of autonomy for Iraqi Kurds had been crystallized
                            in the minds of <persName>Barzani</persName> and his followers. This
                            period of combat lasted, on and off, until 11 March 1970 when
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> signed a settlement with the Ba'thi
                            government in Baghdad. The settlement represented the clearest
                            recognition that any Iraqi Government had offered of the Kurdish demand
                            for autonomy. This, plus the increasing inability of <pb n="7" xml:id="d319-07" facs="d319-07"/>
                            <persName>Barzani</persName> and his leaders to support their
                            population's social needs during prolonged combat, led to the Kurds'
                            acceptance of this settlement.</p>
                        <p>A few months later the Ba'thi regime of Saddam al-Tikriti started
                            planning the destruction of the Kurdish leadership. The Ba'this
                            subsequently tried to assassinate Mulla Barzani and his son Idris.</p>
                        <p>Ba'thi efforts to subdue the Kurds continue today, in concert with
                            intensive and extensive political pressures from the Soviet Union, the
                            German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, and other Communist nations. To
                            further protect its satellite regime in Baghdad, the Soviet Union has
                            pressured Egypt, a longstanding enemy of the Ba'th Party, to adopt a
                            more friendly posture toward Iraq, and convinced even the Syrians, who
                            represent an opposing faction of the Ba'th Party, to terminate their
                            hostile actions against Iraq. These developments have combined with the
                            reign of assassination and torture by the Iraqi Ba'th, under Saddam
                            al-Tikriti, to make Iraq a Soviet satellite, even though, just as in
                            Czechoslovakia, the majority of the population hates the regime.
                            However, the calculated terror and brutality of the Ba'this keep them
                            subdued.</p>
                        <p>Kurdistan is now the only obstacle to complete Soviet dominance of Iraq
                            through Saddam al-Tikriti. Once that is accomplished the Soviets will be
                            able to utilize Iraq and South Yemen (Peoples Democratic Republic of
                            Yemen) to subvert the weak, fledging Persian Gulf states in a pincers
                            movement of subversion. The Kurds have intelligence that South Yemeni
                            leader, 'Abd-al-Fatah Isma'il, has agreed with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to play such a role in the Gulf
                            in concert with the Iraqis.</p>
                        <p>The current state of <persName>Barzani</persName>'s forces allows the
                            Kurdish movement to maintain only a weak defensive posture against the
                            combined forces of their enemies. Mulla Barzani estimates that with the
                            current level of assistance from the Iranians and [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] he can do no more than fight a delaying
                            action against the regime in Baghdad. He feels that within six months he
                            will either have to reach a settlement tantamount to political surrender
                            or he will have to expend his forces and the Kurdish leaders in a short
                            period of combat that will certainly lead to their final defeat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Barzani</persName> is not seeking merely sufficient aid to
                            enable him to defend Kurdistan from the Iraqis and Soviets. That is only
                            his minimum objective. He would prefer to receive political, financial,
                            and military support sufficient for the Kurds to <pb n="8" xml:id="d319-08" facs="d319-08"/>leave their defensive posture to
                            become an offensive force against the Iraqis and their Soviet allies on
                            behalf of the United States and its friends in the Middle East.
                            Hopefully, under such conditions, Kurdish forces could combine with
                            anti-Ba'thi Iraqi Arabs to either overthrow the pro-Soviet regime in
                            Baghdad or to so embroil that regime and its forces in combat that it
                            would no longer represent a threat to Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia,
                            Jordan, or the Persian Gulf states. While recognizing their role as
                            small in an area-wide context, the Kurdish leaders believe they could,
                            nevertheless, make a significant contribution to protecting and even
                            advancing the interests of the United States and its allies in the
                            Middle East. It is this latter point that the Kurdish representatives
                            here wish to stress most strongly. They emphasize that Mulla Barzani is
                            willing to commit his movement to act in concert with United States area
                            objectives and policy guidance in return for the assistance Kurdistan
                            needs. The Kurdish representatives picture such cooperation as
                            consistent with the shared political philosophy of Kurdistan and the
                            United States, i.e., freedom of people to live as they wish and to
                            govern their own affairs.</p>
                        <p>More specifically, the Kurdish representatives here seek recognition by
                            the United States of the Kurdish political objective of autonomy, as it
                            has previously been recognized by governments in the Middle East,
                            including the central government in Baghdad, the Soviet Union, and other
                            Communist nations. The Kurds realize that, because of the need for
                            secrecy in any established relationship between them and the United
                            States Government, such sympathy and recognition for their position
                            would have to remain a secret indefinitely. They would, however, hope
                            that as opportunities arise, the United States would quietly, but
                            publicly note its recognition of Kurdistan as a politically autonomous
                            entity within the independent nation of Iraq.</p>
                        <p>When [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] called on the Shah of
                            Iran on 4 June, the Shah committed himself fully to two possible courses
                            of action consistent with the Kurdish objective of autonomy. The first
                            course, and that preferred by the Shah, would be to utilize Kurdish and
                            anti-Ba'th Arab Iraqis to bring down the Ba'thi government in Iraq. The
                            second course would be as a minimum to support an autonomous Kurdistan
                            within Iraq which could stand on its own feet and resist all attempts to
                            crush it. This is the clearest recognition of Kurdish autonomy ever
                            received from the Iranians.</p>
                        <p>The Kurdish movement also desires the assistance of the United States
                            Government, as it is able in the future, to convince Iran and Turkey
                            that the Kurdish movement in Iraq has no <pb n="9" xml:id="d319-09" facs="d319-09"/>territorial or political ambitions regarding the
                            Kurdish people in either Iran or Turkey. <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            movement is particularly concerned about the Turkish Government which
                            has steadfastly refused to have any contact with the Iraqi Kurds despite
                            the fact that not a bullet has been fired on their mutual borders with
                            Turkey during the past ten years. On the contrary, the Kurdish movement
                            has in effect protected the security of both Turkey and Iran's borders
                            with Kurdistan. This in turn secures most of Iran and Turkey's border
                            with hostile Iraq. The Kurds would appreciate the good offices of the
                            United States Government in putting the Kurds into direct contact with
                            the Turkish Government and expressing the readiness of the Iraqi Kurds
                            to sign any border guarantees desired by either the Turks or the
                            Iranians. The latter two countries can write whatever guarantees they
                            desire regarding current borders and the Kurds will sign them.</p>
                        <p>Last, but not least, the Kurdish movement requests the United States
                            Government to continue the direct contact established between them for
                            the first time on 30 June 1972. The Kurdish movement recognizes that
                            such direct political contact would have to remain secret
                            indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the discussions of 30 June 1972 in Washington, D.C., the
                            Kurdish representatives, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                            believe they have received an expression of sympathy for Kurdish
                            existence as an autonomous, political, and geographic entity within the
                            independent nation of Iraq. They understand that the United States
                            Government has agreed to continue direct contact with their political
                            leadership [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Finally, they
                            understand that the United States Government will consider as soon as
                            possible the Kurdish requests for financial and military assistance and
                            advise of its decision [<hi rend="italic">text not

                            BY UNRULY KURDISH YAZIDI TRIBESMEN IN SINJAR DISTRICT WEST OF MOSUL (ONE
                            OF SEVERAL AREAS CONTESTED BETWEEN <persName>BARZANI</persName> AND
                            BA'THIS REGIME SINCE THEY CONCLUDED SETTLEMENT IN MARCH 1970). REPORTS

                            PAYMENTS OF "PROTECTION MONEY" THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE FROM
                            COMPANY. STRIFE APPARENTLY SPREAD QUICKLY FROM MOSUL PROVINCE (WHERE
                            IRAQI ARMY REPORTEDLY CLASHED WITH KURDS AT DKP HEADQUARTERS IN MOSUL)

                        <p>5. OUR CONTACTS AMONG LOCAL KURDISH/IRAQI EXILES CONFIRM MANY ELEMENTS OF
                            ABOVE STORY, BUT PROVIDE SEVERAL RADICALLY DIFFERENT TWISTS. THEY
                            CONTEND THAT TROUBLE BETWEEN KURDS AND ARABS IN CONTESTED AREAS AROUND
                            MOSUL KIRKUK AND SULAYMANIYYAH ACTUALLY PRECEDED OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE IN
                            SINJAR DISTRICT, ALTHOUGH THEY AGREE THESE TROUBLES BECAME MORE VEHEMENT
                            AFTERWARDS. THEY REGARD STORY ABOUT DEPENDENCE OF 30,000 YAZIDI
                            TRIBESMEN ON IPC "BAKSHEESH" AS BA'THIST FAIRY TALE, NOTING THAT
                            MANICHEAN YAZIDIS HAVE LONG MADE COMMON CAUSE WITH
                                <persName>BARZANI</persName> AND THAT THEIR PARAMOUNT SHAYKH, TAHSIN
                            BEY, HAS JOINED THE MULLA IN HIS MOUNTAIN RETREAT. (THEY ADMIT THAT
                            KURDS AS WHOLE, HOWEVER, ARE UNHAPPY WITH IRAQ GOVT'S ECONOMY DRIVE
                            WHICH HAS PRODUCED DRASTIC CUTBACKS IN EXPENDITURES IN CONTESTED
                            NORTHERN AREAS.) AS FOR ASSASSINATION OF GHANEM AL 'ALI THEY NOTE THAT
                            PESH MERGA HAD BEEN ”GUNNING" FOR HIM FOR SOME TIME, AND THEY REJOICE AT
                            HIS DEMISE. SOME OF THEM EVEN SPECULATE THAT
                                <persName>BARZANI</persName> MAY HAVE ENGINEERED DEATH OF JALLAL
                            HOWEIZI, HIS FORMER (1969) COMRADE IN ARMS WHO HAD ALLEGEDLY SUCCUMBED
                            TO SOFT MINISTERIAL LIFE IN BAGHDAD AND BECOME BA'THIST STOOGE.</p>
                        <p>6. OUR CONTACTS WHO ARE ANTI-BA'THISTS, CONTEND THAT RECENT INCIDENTS IN
                            NORTHERN IRAQ ARE LONG-AWAITED SIGNAL OF BEGINNING OF KURDISH UPRISING
                            AGAINST BAGHDAD GOVT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BARZANI OR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> INITIATED THEM. SOME SAY PRESENT LULL
                            IS TEMPORARY. DICTATED BY FACT THAT <persName>BARZANI</persName> HAS NOT
                            YET WORKED OUT FINAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHOLESALE KURDISH REVOLT WITH HIS
                            ALLIES IN TEHRAN.</p>
                        <p>7. COMMENT: WE ARE UNABLE EVALUATE ACCURACY OF CONFLICTING REPORTS.
                            BA'THIST SPOKESMAN IN BAGHDAD MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO PUT BEST FACE ON
                            SITUATION THAT IS SOURCE OF VITAL CONCERN TO THEM. ON OTHER HAND, WE ARE
                            ONLY TOO AWARE OF BOASTFULNESS AND WISHFUL THINKING WHICH MARKS
                            STATEMENTS OF BARZANI SYMPATHIZERS IN <pb n="4" xml:id="d320-04" facs="d320-04"/>BEIRUT. IN OUR VIEW, ALL THAT CAN BE SAID WITH
                            RELATIVE CERTAINTY IS THAT KURDISH BA'THIST RELATIONS ARE TENSER THAN AT
                            ANY TIME SINCE MARCH 1970 AGREEMENT.</p>

                            representatives and contains a proposal for U.S. action. The proposal
                            provides for two categories of assistance to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Financial and Munitions.</p>
                        <p>On the Financial side, the proposal would provide, in addition to
                            contributions from Iran, [<hi rend="italic">text not delcassified</hi>]
                            $3 million from the U. S. over one year. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> would furnish this [<hi rend="italic">text not

                                <persName>Barzani</persName>.</p>
                        <p>With respect to munitions, the U. S. would supply roughly $2 million in
                            supplies (exclusive of transportation costs). The ordnance would be
                            delivered [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to Iran for
                            turnover to the Kurds. Details on costing are at Enclosure 3 of the
                            attached memorandum.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> both favor support for
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. A case could be made that it is more
                            important than ever due to the recent events in Egypt which will
                            probably result in more intense Soviet efforts in Iraq. At the same
                            time, sensitivity increases immeasurably in the light of Soviet paranoia
                            resulting from events in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Procedurally, we have two options:</p>
                        <p>Circumvent the 40 Committee and go directly by memorandum to the
                            President and then deal solely with <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, or—<pb n="2" xml:id="d321-02" facs="d321-02"/>Inform 40 Committee principals only

                        <p>I think we should pursue the latter course in the event something blows
                            and we could insist that established procedures were followed.
                            Furthermore, I doubt very much that the operation can be conducted
                            without its surfacing in official channels at some point.</p>
                        <p>If you agree, I will have this converted to a memorandum to the President
                            for your approval and advise him that we are instructing the principals
                            only of his decision and move with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss>, to get the action

                            <head>SUBJECT:</head>
                            <item>Assistance to Iraqi Kurdish Leader, Mulla Mustafa Barzani</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. This memorandum describes a proposal for covert assistance to the
                            Iraqi Kurdish leader, Mulla Mustafa Barzani. Attached are the following:
                            (1) an inventory of the proposed ordnance for the Kurds (Attachment A)
                            and (2) an estimate of the situation entitled Prospects and Problems of
                            Assistance to the Kurds (Attachment B).</p>
                        <p>2. Material assistance required by Mulla Mustafa Barzani to continue
                            resistance to the Ba'thi regime in Baghdad falls into two main
                            categories, (a) financial and (b) ordnance.</p>
                        <p>3. With regard to financial assistance, our intelligence has consistently
                            placed the yearly requirement for financing the Pish Mirga
                                (<persName>Barzani</persName>'s guerrilla army), with a strength of
                            25,000, at approximately $18 million. While
                            <persName>Barzani</persName>'s recent emissaries placed their total
                            annual requirements at $60 million, this figure envisioned a full-scale
                            military offensive involving 60,000 troops and included the cost of a
                            government infrastructure and certain social services to the Kurdish
                            population. It is not recommended that we encourage or support such an
                            ambitious, highly provocative, and probably impractical scale of
                            activity, which would exceed the limits of covert capability.</p>
                        <p>4. Of the $18 million required for guerrilla warfare of an essentially
                            defensive nature, we have indications that Iran may be prepared to fund
                            half this sum, or $9 million. [<hi rend="italic">text not

                        <p>5. In the financial subsidy category, it is recommended that we provide
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> with [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] — $3 million over one year's time. [<hi rend="italic">text not delcassified</hi>] Both
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and the Shah would, however, be witting
                            of our contribution. While this figure is in some ways arbitrary, it is
                            arrived at in the conviction that (a) at least half the total should be
                            borne by Iran, whose equities as neighbor to Iraq are particularly high,
                            and (b) the balance might well be split [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>6. In the category of ordnance assistance, the Agency now has in stock
                            the additional arms and ammunition required by the Kurds. This ordnance
                            is of either non-attributable, foreign manufacture or of US manufacture
                            normally stocked by Iraq or Iran, except for artillery (ground and
                            anti-aircraft) and tanks, which we should probably not in any event
                            undertake to supply. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Thus
                            the total cost of ordnance support is 2,004,190, exclusive of shipping
                            charges. Transportation costs, [<hi rend="italic">text not

                        <p>7. It is recognized that the transportation problem will be considerable.
                            Since it is our recom- mendation that the ordnance be delivered [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and thus covered by the
                            Iranians, the feasibility and security of shipment and reception in

                            Kurdistan cannot be definitely determined without detailed exploratory
                            consultations with a highly select few [<hi rend="italic">text not

                        <p>The following is a preliminary estimate which sets forth in detail
                            considerations relevant to covert <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            support to the Iraqi Kurds under the leadership of Mulla Mustafa
                            Barzani.</p>
                        <p>SUMMARY:</p>
                        <p>1. It is clearly in the interest of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and its friends and allies in the area that the present
                            Iraqi regime be kept off balance, or even overthrown if that can be done
                            without escalating hostilities on the international level. The most
                            effective and secure means to achieve this end will be to furnish
                            appropriate support to <persName>Barzani</persName> and the Kurds to
                            enable them to maintain their resistance to the regime. The regime,
                            despotic internally, is aggressively hostile in its intentions toward
                            Iran, Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the newly-formed Federation of
                            Arab Emirates. The danger Iraqi hostility poses has become an
                            increasingly significant factor in the area because of the steadily
                            deepening Soviet support for Iraq, now institutionalized in the
                            Soviet-Iraqi treaty of friendship and coopera- tion signed 9 April 1972.
                            Soviet awareness of the threat Kurdish opposition represents to the
                            Iraqi regime has been reflected recently in increased Soviet and East
                            German pressure on <persName>Barzani</persName> to join the National
                            Charter Front sponsored by the Soviets and the regime. Both the regime
                            and the Soviets appreciate that if the Iraqi Army must be mobilized and
                            redeployed for a renewed campaign against the Kurds, it is likely to
                            become less subject to regime control, and the regime's capabilities for
                            action against its neighbors be reduced. Nonetheless, there are current
                            indications that the regime may itself be preparing to take the military
                            initiative against <pb n="7" xml:id="d321-07" facs="d321-07"/>the Kurds,
                            and the likelihood of its doing so will increase if it becomes aware of
                            the present Kurdish approach to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] for support.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether or not the Iraqi regime chooses to initiate military action
                            against the Kurds, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> can covertly
                            assist <persName>Barzani</persName> to maintain Kurdish opposition to
                            the regime. If the Kurds are attacked by Iraqi forces, they will require
                            ammunition for their existing stocks of arms and additional arms of
                            compatible type without delay. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            assistance should be furnished with maximum administrative and physical
                            security feasible in the circumstances so as to enhance plausible
                            denial, although the multilateral context in which this assistance must
                            be provided will inevitably entail security complications. Apart from
                            considerations of plausible denial, the volume and type of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> financial and materiel assistance
                            should be such as to encourage the Kurds to adhere to the kind of
                            guerrilla operations within their mountainous redoubt at which they
                            traditionally excel, as well as to obviate insofar as possible the risk
                            that major Kurdish military escalation might provoke direct Soviet
                            intervention in the conflict.</p>
                        <p>3. The provision of significant <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            covert support to the Kurds will involve certain problems, including
                            that of possible direct Soviet involvement. While Soviet intervention
                            would jeopardize the improved relations with Iran for which the Soviets
                            in recent years have been consistently working, Soviet readiness to pay
                            this price to safeguard their investment and position in Iraq cannot be
                            excluded. Another problem will be presented by Turkish sensitivity to
                            Kurdish nationalism because of their concern for the large Kurdish
                            minority in the eastern region of Turkey. Then there are the limitations
                            on <persName>Barzani</persName>'s influence and effectiveness among the
                            Kurds imposed by Kurdish factionalism and divisiveness even within the
                            Kurdish Democratic Party of which he is the leader, as well as problems
                            implicit in <persName>Barzani</persName> advanced age and the lack of a
                            suitable heir to his political powers among the Kurds. Finally, there is
                            the complication <pb n="8" xml:id="d321-08" facs="d321-08"/>inherent in
                            the initiation of covert <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support to
                            the Kurds at a time when the Department of State envisages the opening
                            of a two-officer US Interests Section in Baghdad sometime in early fall
                            1972.</p>
                        <p>4. The problems notwithstanding, it is clear that unless the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and other interested nations provide
                            increased support to Barzani, he will have no reasonable alternative to
                            reaching an early accommodation with the Iraqi regime — an accommodation
                            which would serve Soviet aims and enhance Iraq's capabilities for
                            disruption of stability among other nations in the area.
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and some of the parties involved in
                            supporting him envision Kurdish resistance as part of a larger movement
                            including non-Kurdish Iraqi elements which would replace the radical
                            Ba'thi regime with a government of moderation and re- conciliation. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>5. In anticipation of a decision to provide covert support to the Kurds,
                            we have been planning the modalities of such support, especially the
                            priority supply of ammunition and additional compatible armament to
                            bolster the Kurds' defensive capability. Preliminary checks with the
                            appropriate [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] component
                            reveal that substantial quantities of arms and ammunition are
                            available.</p>

                        <p>PROSPECTS</p>
                        <p>1. In their discussions with our representatives, the Kurdish emissaries
                            outlined their political, financial and intelligence requirements in
                            considerable detail. As we analyze these requirements and explore
                            procedures for dealing with them, we are also considering the
                            ramifications of our developing relationship with the Kurds in order to
                            achieve desired results with minimum risks of undesired side effects.
                            Some aspects of the situation which will affect the level and manner of
                            our support are discussed below. They concern Soviet support of the
                            Ba'thi regime and government commitments under the Treaty of April 1972;
                            the military capabilities and requirements of the Kurds; and such
                            problems as Kurdish factionalism, Turkish hostility to the Kurds, and
                            the modalities of maintaining contact with Mulla Mustafa Barzani and
                            providing him with financial and logistic support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ba'thi-Soviet Collaboration Against Moderate
                            Regimes and Western Interests</p>
                        <p>2. There can be no doubt that it is in the interest of ourselves, our
                            allies, and other friendly governments in the area to see the Ba'thi
                            regime in Iraq kept off balance and if possible overthrown, if this can
                            be done without increasing Soviet influence in Iraq or escalating
                            hostilities to a dangerous international level.</p>
                        <p>3. This regime has not been content with despotic control of its own
                            territory and people. Moved by an aggressive, adventurist,
                            pseudo-Marxist ideology, it has mounted campaigns against its neighbors
                            and against all western interests in the Gulf. Under the leadership of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">Saddam Husayn Tikriti</persName>, the
                            Iraqi Balthi clique has promoted <pb n="10" xml:id="d321-10" facs="d321-10"/>subversion in Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Union of Arab
                            Emirates. It has trained and dispatched saboteurs and assassins against
                            the Shah, and tried to foment insurrections of Arab and Baluchi
                            minorities in Iran. Balthi assassination squads have operated
                            successfully in Kuwait and Beirut and have also attempted to murder a
                            former Iraqi Prime Minister in London.</p>
                        <p>4. While Ba'thi aspirations heretofore may have seemed far beyond their
                            capabilities, developments of the past few months suggest that they now
                            should be taken much more seriously. For during these few months the
                            Soviet Union has clearly revealed an intention to exploit the Iraqi
                            regime to advance its strategic and economic interests in the Middle
                            East. Although deducible from many earlier Soviets acts and
                            pronouncements, Soviet strategy to gain control of the area and its
                            resources has never before been so evident.</p>
                        <p>5. On 7 April 1972 Soviet Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Alexei Kosygin</persName> spoke at the inauguration ceremony of the
                            North Rumaila oilfield, which has been developed with upward of 200
                            million dollars worth of Soviet technical assistance. He enunciated a
                            theme which communist propaganda had been agitating since World War II,
                            namely that the countries of the area should end the exploitation of
                            their oil by capitalist oil companies. He hailed the pressure of
                            national liberation movements which had forced the colonialists to
                            withdraw in the Middle East, as in other parts of the world. Against the

                        <p>6. Two days later, on 9 April in Baghdad, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and Iraqi President AHMAD HASAN AL-<persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> signed a Treaty of Friendship and
                            Cooperation, the published provisions of which provide for coordination
                            of their stands in the event of a threat to the peace of either party
                            and continuing cooperation in consolidating their mutual defense
                            capabilities. These provisions gave the Iraqi regime the prospect of
                            Soviet support in the event Of external attacks, <pb n="11" xml:id="d321-11" facs="d321-11"/>and possibly even in the event of
                            an internal insurrection. Article 9, concerning consolidating mutual
                            defense capabilities, seems to promise the Soviet Union increased naval
                            facilities in Iraqi Gulf ports and further access to Iraqi airfields.
                            This Treaty serves as a reminder of a treaty negotiated by the Soviet
                            Union with Nazi Germany 32 years ago, in which the Soviet Union declared
                            that its territorial aspirations center south of the national territory
                            of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean. (Documents on

                        <p>7. Less than two months after <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s Rumaila speech and the signing of the
                            Soviet-Iraqi Treaty, the Ba'thi government on 1 June 1972 announced the
                            nationalization of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Immediately
                            thereafter the Iraqi Foreign Minister led a delegation to Moscow to
                            obtain Soviet assistance in avoiding the economic consequences of
                            anticipated retaliation by western companies and governments. The Soviet
                            news agency TASS strongly supported the nationalization of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, calling it a move toward liberating
                            Iraq "from the sway of foreign capital.” By 3 June Radio Moscow was
                            broadcasting in Persian to Iran a commentary that the Iraqi
                            nationalization of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> should serve an
                            example for Iran in dealing with the plundering activity of the
                            international oil consortium. "Today we are witnessing the
                            nationalization of assets of the imperialist oil monopoly in Iraq.
                            Undoubtedly this will happen in other countries sooner or later. The

                            Balthis and Soviets</p>
                        <p>8. The Soviet Union obviously has attached great <pb n="12" xml:id="d321-12" facs="d321-12"/>importance to getting Mulla Mustafa
                            Barzani and his Kurdish followers to adhere to the "National Charter
                            Front" sponsored by the Soviets and including both the Ba'th and the
                            Communist Party of Iraq. The Kurdish emissaries and our independent
                            sources have reported recent visits by senior Soviet officials and East
                            German delegations to <persName>Barzani</persName> to persuade him to
                            join the Front. The Soviets and the Ba'th evidently realize that so long
                            as <persName>Barzani</persName> maintains an independent enclave in the
                            north, there will always be a threat to the permanence of the unpopular
                            dictatorship in Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>9. During the early and middle 1960's, Kurdish insurgency tied down
                            two-thirds of the Iraqi army. This contributed to conditions which
                            facilitated a series of successful military coups and effectively
                            limited Iraqi capabilities for military adventures abroad against
                            Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iran. <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">Saddam
                                Husayn Tikriti</persName> has successfully increased Ba'thi civilian
                            political control over the Iraqi army. If the army has to be mobilized
                            and deployed for another campaign against the Kurds, however, it will
                            have to be provided with increased quantities of ammunition and fuel and
                            be given greater operational initiative. This may lessen the
                            effectiveness of Ba'th party controls within the army and enhance the
                            opportunities for a military coup. A recent study by the Office of
                            Intelligence Research of the Department of State speculates that if
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> can find sufficient outside support to
                            renew his insurgency, the added strain of another Kurdish war could
                            bring down the Ba'thi government.</p>
                        <p>10. Past history of the Iraqi Ba'th adventurers does not suggest that
                            they can be placated by concessions. They exploit weakness and are
                            likely to be deterred from their aggressive course only by fear of the
                            consequences of failure or by being kept on the defensive.</p>
                        <p>11. The present situation, when the Ba'thi regime is faced with a serious
                            reduction in income, and while the organized Kurdish political
                            leadership is still disposed to resist, may be our last desperate chance
                            to engage in a spoiling operation designed at least to harass <pb n="13" xml:id="d321-13" facs="d321-13"/>the Ba'th and perhaps to contribute
                            to conditions favorable to its replacement by elements less hostile to
                            our interests and those of our friends in this area. We must recognize
                            that the Ba'th may be impelled by rising Kurdish opposition to seek more
                            support from the Soviet Union. The alternative of letting the Kurdish
                            resistance die from lack of support, however, will mean that the Kurds
                            will be compelled to join the Soviet-sponsored National Front, and the
                            Ba'th will be able unhindered to pursue its offensive in the area. On
                            balance it appears better to take the risks of keeping Kurdish
                            resistance alive.</p>
                        <p>12. From our point of view, it is desirable to provide
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> with sufficient encouragement and
                            support to maintain a position not dependent on the Baghdad regime and
                            capable of preventing final military conquest of the Kurdish areas by
                            the Iraqi army. So long as a Kurdish redoubt exists, dissident elements
                            in the army and on the Iraqi political scene will not despair of an
                            opportunity eventually to overturn the regime. Maintenance of Kurdish
                            resistance even at the defensive level will also limit the regime's
                            capability for engaging in aggressive adventures against Iran, Jordan,
                            and the Gulf.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>13. Despite hopes of mounting a major offensive against Baghdad,
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> must know well that until he has a much
                            more effective anti-aircraft capability and an adequate supply of
                            defensive arms and ammunition, it will not be in his interest to engage
                            in offensive operations which will trigger retaliatory air and ground.
                            strikes against his towns and villages.</p>
                        <p>14. Barzanils desire to avoid a premature military confrontation with the
                            Ba'thi regime may not, however, be sufficient to prevent one being
                            thrust upon him by the Ba'th in the very near future. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>
                            has had reports that the Iraqi army has recently been training

                            been two recent aerial reconnaissances of Barzanils headquarters in the

                                <persName>Barzani</persName> is reported to believe an attack may be
                            imminent and to have ordered his people to open fire on any more
                            overflights. The Iraqi press and radio have mounted a major campaign
                            during the past week alleging that a band of thirty men, fifteen of them
                            Kurds, who were involved in a clash in the Sinjar area of northwestern
                            Iraq on 3 July were a mercenary gang of imperialist stooges, puppets for
                            monopolistic oil companies, and links in a chain of American plots
                            against Iraq. It is also possible that due to the number of countries
                            being approached by <persName>Barzani</persName>, the Soviet Union and
                            the Ba'th will have become aware of <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            effort to obtain American support. This might reinforce Soviet and
                            Ba'thi inclinations to take preemptive action against
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> before he can strengthen his
                            position.</p>

                        <p>15. <persName>Barzani</persName> may actually have no option but a purely
                            defensive stand and a struggle for survival. He then will need as
                            quickly as possible ammunition for the weapons already in his hands,
                            plus additional weapons of types with which the Kurds are already
                            familiar. These emergency supplies should be delivered by methods and
                            routes which combine minimum delay with as much secrecy as possible in
                            the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>16. If <persName>Barzani</persName> can avoid an immediate Iraqi assault
                            we will give priority consideration to his longer range requirements
                            under the three alternative strategies outlined by his emissaries. They
                            projected financial and materiel requirements in terms of three possible
                            levels of action described by them as "defensive, offensive, and
                            revolutionary platforms.”</p>
                        <p>17. The first, or "defensive platform,” they said, would involve a
                            minimal increase of outside assistance to permit their movement to
                            preserve the status quo and resist indefinitely political, economic, and
                            military pressures from the Ba'th.</p>
                        <p>18. The second, or "offensive platform,” which is the one
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> favors, would provide the Kurds with
                            the <pb n="15" xml:id="d321-15" facs="d321-15"/>financial and military
                            means not only to maintain their position, but so to tie up the Ba'thi
                            regime that it no longer would pose a military or subversive threat to
                            its neighbors and western interests. <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            projection of his financial and military materiel requirements was keyed
                            to this platform of activity.</p>
                        <p>19. The third, or "revolutionary platform,” would involve the use of
                            Kurdistan as a secure base from which to promote the overthrow of the
                            Ba'thi regime in cooperation with other anti-regime Iraqis. The Kurdish
                            emissaries declared that this level of activity would require little
                            further investment beyond that of the second level, but would involve
                            financial assistance to Arab collaborators.</p>
                        <p>20. In their discussion of the types of equipment needed for the second
                            or offensive platform of activity, it appeared that the Kurds have some
                            unrealistic ideas about military actions and the kinds of equipment
                            which they could use. Their interest in tanks for action outside the
                            mountains suggests a belief that they can engage the Iraqi army in
                            conventional warfare. It also assumes a logistics base in Iran which
                            would be similar to that provided by North Vietnam to the Viet Cong. To
                            their credit, however, the Kurdish emissaries were frank in admitting
                            the need for military advice.</p>
                        <p>21. If past experience proves anything, it is that the Kurds do best
                            against the Iraqi army when they remain well within their mountains and
                            engage in aggressive guerrilla tactics, hitting the Iraqis in many
                            places and keeping them off balance. Totally lacking in air support, in
                            armor and in heavy artillery, as they must continue to be, the Kurds
                            cannot prevent the Iraqi army from bombarding their towns and villages
                            or, during the summer when the roads are open, from sending armored
                            columns to attack villages which lie along major roads through the
                            valleys. The Kurds.. with their light infantry weapons, have lateral
                            mobility across ridges and valleys, while the army, with heavy weapons
                            and vehicles, has mobility only up and down the valley roads. The army
                            has virtually <pb n="16" xml:id="d321-16" facs="d321-16"/>no lateral
                            mobility from ridge to ridge across the sharp defiles.</p>

                        <p>22. The Kurds recognize that by themselves they cannot bring about the
                            overthrow of the Ba'thi regime. Other forces must be brought into play
                            to maximize the pressures on the Ba'th.</p>
                        <p>23. This calls for identification of those individuals and groups among
                            which discontent already exists or can be stimulated, and a
                            determination of how discontent and antagonisms can best be
                            exploited.</p>
                        <p>24. Three prime groups for consideration are the Ba'th itself, the Iraqi
                            military establishment, and the Iraqi political exiles.</p>
                        <p>25. Our reporting indicates that there currently is some degree of
                            tension between President AL-BAKR and the strongman of the <gloss target="#t_BPI1">BPI</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_al Tikriti, Hardan Abd Al Ghaffar1">Saddam Husayn al
                                Tikriti</persName>. This is an obvious area for exploitation. There
                            are other areas of discontent within the Ba'th, for example, the
                            privileged position of the members of the Public Relations Bureau within
                            the party, and friction between the civilian and military wings of the
                            party. Our information on this aspect is limited.</p>
                        <p>26. Recent purges by the <gloss target="#t_BPI1">BPI</gloss> within the
                            Iraqi army are bound to have heightened the elements of fear and hatred
                            of the regime within the officer corps, but again, our information on
                            this is limited.</p>
                        <p>27. We know more about the current group of Iraqi political exiles. A
                            number of them have a history of insecure and unsuccessful plotting. The
                            same may be said of the Iranians [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                delcassified</hi>] in their past efforts to promote coups in
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p>28. Fast and systematic vetting of all non-Kurdish elements who surface
                            as this activity develops will be essential.</p>

                        <p>29. In canvassing possible stocks of weapons which may be provided to the
                            Kurds, we should give priority to weapons with which they are already
                            supplied and to ammunition for those weapons. Second priority should be
                            given to anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons, including land mines and
                            rockets, with emphasis on portability. The portability factor suggests
                            that the Kurds should be advised to depend upon rocket and mortar-type
                            weapons, rather than to attempt to increase their conventional artillery
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>30. The Kurdish spokesmen indicated that in the event of an "offensive"
                            phase, they envisioned the expansion of their Pish Mirga armed force to
                            60,000 men. There are at present only 24,000 Kurds under arms, 14,000 in
                            the Iraqi government-paid frontier and police forces, and 10,000 in the
                            independent Kurdish irregular units. The logistics of supporting a
                            60,000 man force in such an inaccessible area would be of staggering
                            dimensions. Access by road from Iran is limited. Supply by air would be
                            far beyond Iranian capabilities and could not be kept secret or even
                            discreet.</p>
                        <p>31. We should bear in mind that the Kurdish request for [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to sustain their
                            "offensive plat- form" was to cover only Pish Mirga salaries, care for
                            widows and orphans, and social and educational services -in effect the
                            budgetary support required to support a Kurdish state. It did not
                            include the costs of combat, i.e., supplying weapons, ammunition, and
                            communications equipment.</p>
                        <p>32. Coming directly on the heels of the Soviet-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship
                            and Cooperation, massive foreign involvement could hardly be ignored by
                            the Soviets, no matter how much they might desire to avoid complicating
                            their smooth relations with the Shah. The Soviets have invested heavily
                            in their position in Iraq and would not readily see it lost. The Ba'thi
                            regime has given them more than they ever had before. The Treaty, even
                            if it contains no secret provisions, seems to look toward Soviet
                            intervention if needed to keep the present regime in power.</p>

                        <p>33. Our effort in further talks with <persName>Barzani</persName>'s
                            representatives should thus be to keep their expectations within limits
                            of reality and which can be satisfied within the bounds of plausible
                            denial, and to counsel them against actions likely to escalate to an
                            international confrontation.</p>
                        <p>34. The modalities of providing financial and military support depend
                            upon the degree of secrecy desired, the level of military capability we
                            wish to provide, and the collateral objectives we wish to achieve.</p>
                        <p>35. Unlike arms, money can be provided either directly or indirectly,
                            with minimal problems of clandestinity. We might find it in our interest
                            to provide some financial assistance [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] the Iranians to reinforce their feelings of
                            participation as well as for security reasons. We might also find it
                            useful to pass some funds directly to the Kurds to enhance our own
                            influence, as well as to provide some measure of unilateral control and
                            a device for intelligence exploitation. The mechanics of acquiring the
                            required currency and passing it to the Kurds in Iraq and elsewhere can
                            be worked out.</p>
                        <p>36. Arms are another matter, and we already have indicated to the Kurds
                            that most of our assistance might have to be via third parties.
                            Geography makes Iran an essential intermediary in any arms delivery
                            system. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>

                            arrangements. The multilateral nature of our involvement, however, will
                            impose obstacles to complete secrecy, and we may in the event have to
                            settle simply for plausible denial. The Kurds themselves <pb n="19" xml:id="d321-19" facs="d321-19"/>are too divided and penetrated to
                            keep major secrets from sophisticated foreign intelligence
                            organizations, and some of the third parties involved are prone to
                            leaks. Since we have already been accused by the Ba'thi regime of
                            helping their enemies, our concern should be only that no exploitable
                            evidence be provided to support hostile charges. These would continue

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Involvement:</p>
                        <p>39. There is a definite possibility of increased Soviet involvement in
                            support of the Ba'thi regime if hostilities begin with the Kurds, or
                            even if the Iraqis anticipate the initiation of hostilities. The Soviets
                            now have a great stake in Iraq, carved out originally during the Qasim
                            period 1958-63, maintained despite setbacks under the original Ba'thi
                            anti-communist government of February - November 1963, greatly expanded
                            since 1968, and culminating in the alliance of April 1972.</p>
                        <p>40. Soviet military and economic aid to Iraq since the overthrow of the
                            monarchy in July 1958 has been second only to that provided to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Even during the months
                            following the Ba'thi coup of 8 February 1963 against Qasim, when the
                            Ba'th was executing communists by the hundreds and the Soviet Union was
                            denouncing their movement as Fascist, the Soviets did not terminate
                            their involvement with the Iraqi army or with the many economic projects
                            which they had launched. They estimated that eventually any Iraqi
                            regime, dependent on Soviet cooperation for ammunition and spares for
                            its Soviet equipped army and air force, would have no choice but to
                            restore relations to cooperative levels. The Soviets were correct. The
                            first Ba'thi government and its non-Ba'thi and radical Ba'thi successors
                            have become increasingly beholden to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>41. The acceleration of Soviet influence on Iraq since early this year is
                            a source for special concern. After having provided the Iraqis the money
                            and technical expertise to bring the confiscated North Rumaila oil field
                            into production, the Soviets consolidated their favorable position with
                            the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed on 9 April. Three
                            articles of that Treaty are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Article 8: In case of emergence of conditions that threaten violation of
                            the peace, the two signatories will immediately hold contacts in order
                            to coordinate their stands to eliminate the danger and restore the
                            peace.</p>
                        <pb n="21" xml:id="d321-21" facs="d321-21"/>
                        <p>Article 9: In the interest of security of the two countries, the two
                            signatories will continue to develop cooperation for consolidating the
                            defense capability of each other.</p>
                        <p>Article 10: Each of the two signatories de- clares that it will not enter
                            into pacts, or take part in any international groupings or any actions
                            or measures aimed at the other signatory. Each of the two signatories
                            also pledges not to allow the use of its territory in undertaking any
                            action that would result in a military harm to the other. (Text from

                        <p>42. The Soviets were active in promoting a detente between the Iraqi
                            Ba'thi regime and the Ba'thi regime in Syria, which had been its bitter
                            enemy in their internecine struggle for party hegemony. The Soviets also
                            promoted better relations between Iraq and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. They were instrumental in promoting a coalition of
                            Iraqi political factions, including the Communists and formerly
                            pro-Nasir nationalists, in a National Front under Ba'thi leadership. The
                            Soviets, including Kosygin himself, have tried to persuade
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> to join the Front. Their efforts
                            indicate the importance they attach to shoring up the Ba'thi regime,
                            which has given them so much and is so aggressive in attacking Western
                            interests in the area.</p>
                        <p>43. <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> has had reports that Iraqi
                            paratroops are training in the vicinity of Mosul and Kirkuk with Soviet
                            officers and advisers present. During the civil war in Yemen, when the
                            Soviet-backed Republican government troops were hard pressed by the
                            royalist forces, the Soviets provided Soviet pilots to help in the
                            emergency. Soviet pilots and planes were also deployed in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> when Israeli deep-penetration raids
                            proved to be more than the Egyptians could cope with. It is not
                            unlikely, therefore, that if they should judge the Ba'thi regime is
                            seriously threatened, the Soviets would send some forces in — even
                            "Kurdish volunteers" from their reservoir of Kurds — to help the Ba'th
                            and protect the Soviet investment in Iraq. They might also mount a
                            political, diplomatic, and propaganda campaign in support of their Iraqi
                            clients.</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="d321-22" facs="d321-22"/>
                        <p>44. The Soviets would probably wish to avoid a confrontation with Iran
                            which would jeopardize the advantages they have gained with the Shah in
                            cent years. They might, however, estimate that they could frighten him
                            off and that even if he were angered at Soviet threats of intervention
                            or actual intervention, he would be even more upset by the probable
                            unwillingness or inability of his American allies to confront the
                            Soviets on his behalf.</p>
                        <p>45. If, as a result of renewed Kurdish-Iraqi hostilities the Soviet Union
                            were to send troops into Iraq or the Ba'th felt sufficiently menaced by
                            such outside enemies as Iran, the Soviets might be invited to remain on
                            Iraqi soil indefinitely. The presence of operational Soviet ground and
                            air forces inside Iraq on a scale comparable to that in Egypt could at
                            some future date provide just the degree of reliable support required
                            for a communist-dominated power group to seize power from the Ba'th. Now
                            in Iraq the Soviets are pressing all parties to join a National Front.
                            Their treaty and the developing situation may provide the other
                            ingredient for an eventual power-play — namely, a Soviet military
                            presence.</p>

                        <p>46. The Turkish aspect of the proposed operation requires further study.
                            The Turks are acutely sensitive to any manifestations of Kurdish
                            nationalism on their borders. Three million Kurds, nearly half of the
                            world's total, live in Turkey. Although the Kurds have been vigorously
                            suppressed and are now called "Mountain Turks,” they are still regarded
                            by the Turks as a serious potential threat to internal stability and the
                            integrity of the state. Despite Turkish dislike for the Ba'thi regime
                            and its alliance with the Soviet Union, the Turkish government is likely
                            to see militant Kurdish nationalism as a more immediate threat than the
                            Ba'th to its peace and security. On 25 June 1970, when Iraqi President
                            AL-BAKR passed through Ankara, he conferred with Turkish leaders on the
                            Kurdish problem. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] The
                            Turks are apprehensive of Kurdish aspirations eventually to establish a

                            Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. [<hi rend="italic">text not

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Kurdish Factionalism:</p>
                        <p>47. The Kurds of Iraq are far from being united in support of Mulla
                            Mustafa Barzani. Deep factional cleavages rooted in tribal, political
                            and social conflicts divide the Kurds into competing and mutually
                            hostile groups. This situation poses problems of effectiveness and
                            especially of security in any program to provide assistance to
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>.</p>
                        <p>48. <persName>Barzani</persName> has played the preeminent role in
                            Kurdish efforts to gain autonomy within Iraq. He was the leader of the
                            Kurdish revolt of 1943 and the military commander of Ghazi Muhammad's
                            “Mahabad Republic" on Iranian soil in 1946. He has led the Kurdish
                            military effort against the Baghdad government since 1961. He has become
                            not only a Kurdish leader, but a world figure.</p>
                        <p>49. Within the Kurdish movement, however, there are many counter-currents
                            which have limited <persName>Barzani</persName>'s attempts to unify
                            Kurdish efforts. These currents are likely to endure and continue to
                            weaken Kurdish military and political initiatives.</p>
                        <p>50. The most fundamental sources of division lie in traditional tribal
                            rivalries. <persName>Barzani</persName> himself is not a tribal leader,
                            but a religious one, a Mulla. His “<persName>Barzani</persName>”
                            followers are not, strictly speaking, a tribe, but Kurds who inhabit the
                            Barzan region of Northeastern Iraq and who follow
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. Several important Kurdish tribes have
                            opposed him actively, and others have passively refused to support or
                            oppose him. The Baghdad government under Qasim and his successors was
                            able to pit elements of the Zibari, Harki, and Baradost tribes against
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>. Qasim even organized a Kurdish cavalry
                            unit, <pb n="24" xml:id="d321-24" facs="d321-24"/>the Saladin Brigade,
                            which he used for attacks on Kurdish rebels and their villages. Despite
                            this background of divisiveness, however, <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            has wider support among Kurds today than any other Kurdish leader.</p>
                        <p>51. A second kind of divisiveness lies in the conflicting political
                            orientations of factions within the Kurdish Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>), of which <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            has been President since shortly after returning from the Soviet Union
                            to Iraq in 1958. There are strong dissident elements within the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>, many of them Marxist, which often have
                            challenged <persName>Barzani</persName>'s leadership and from 1958 to
                            1960 succeeded in making the Party's program practically identical with
                            that of the Communist Party of Iraq, except for its Kurdish autonomy
                            aspects. Many of the Kurdish political and guerrilla leaders who hold
                            Marxist views are better educated and more cosmopolitan than the
                            supporters of <persName>Barzani</persName>. One of these, Ibrahim Ahmed,
                            has been a leading figure in the Communist movement in Iraq. Another
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> rival, Jalal Talabani, while not a
                            Communist, has challenged <persName>Barzani</persName> several times in
                            the past. While he has temporarily accepted
                            <persName>Barzani</persName>'s leadership, there is little doubt that he
                            will again assert himself when a favorable opportunity presents itself.
                            Some Kurds are undoubtedly Soviet agents who will keep the Soviets
                            informed of all plans and activities to which they become privy.</p>
                        <p>52. <persName>Barzani</persName> is 69 years old. While he is still
                            vigorous, it is obvious that his own years of leadership are limited.
                            Some of his own sons, notably the eldest, Lugman, and another,
                            Ubaydallah, have sold out to the Baghdad government. He is actively
                            supported by his sons Idris and Ma'sud. Ma'sud leads his intelligence
                            organi- zation. Idris has handled contacts for enlisting outside
                            support. Neither of them have the charisma of their father, and they
                            appear unlikely candidates to take over leadership of the Kurdish
                            movement after him. Such leadership is more likely to pass to Jalal
                            Talabani or someone like him.</p>
                        <p>53. Our awareness of the deep factional differences among the Kurds does
                            not preclude providing <persName>Barzani</persName> or others with
                            covert assistance as part of an effort to blunt Balthi and Soviet
                            offensives against our friends and interests. Knowledge of Kurdish
                            divisions should, however, <pb n="25" xml:id="d321-25" facs="d321-25"/>keep us from having illusions that support of
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> would enable him to control the entire
                            northern region of Iraq and make the kinds of arrangements for
                            exploiting its resources which <persName>Barzani</persName>'s emissaries
                            projected.</p>

                            despite their diplomatic break with us in June 1967.) The placement and
                            retention of American officials in Baghdad would be jeopardized if the
                            Iraqis become aware of our support of the Kurds. [<hi rend="italic">text

                        <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <pb n="26" xml:id="d321-26" facs="d321-26"/>
                        <p>56. The threat to moderate Middle-Eastern governments and to western
                            interests posed by the Soviet-backed Iraqi Ba'thi regime warrants
                            helping <persName>Barzani</persName> maintain his opposition to that
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>57. Regardless of his own plans, <persName>Barzani</persName> may have
                            hostilities forced upon him by a pre-emptive Iraqi military offensive.
                            In that case he will need some basic defense supplies on a priority
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>58. Our contribution to <persName>Barzani</persName>, whether in money or
                            material, should be provided with the maximum administrative and
                            physical security of which we are capable, recognizing that
                            multi-lateral involvement inevitably will involve security
                            complications.</p>
                        <p>59. Our financial and materiel contributions should be kept on a scale
                            consistent with plausible denial. If our assistance goes beyond certain
                            dimensions it will not be possible to maintain plausible denial.</p>
                        <p>60. As a complementary effort, we should explore the feasibility of
                            exploiting directly or indirectly non-Kurdish elements in the Iraqi
                            political scene.</p>
                        <p>61. Multi-national involvement in supporting <persName>Barzani</persName>
                            and other elements opposed to the Ba'thi regime, requires coordination
                            of the efforts of all parties in order to enhance security and
                            effectiveness and to avoid working at cross-purposes.</p>

                            RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS STILL VALID AND THAT NO
                            CHANGE WHATSOEVER IS INTRODUCED ON THIS MEASURE. THE SPOKESMAN, WHO WAS
                            COMMENTING ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN
                            THURSDAY ON THE ASSIGNMENT OF A U.S. DIPLOMAT IN BAGHDAD SAID, "WHAT
                            OCCURRED DID NOT GO BEYOND THE APPOINTMENT OF TWO DIPLOMATS FOR THE U.S.
                            INTERESTS SECTION IN THE BELGIAN EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD. IN RETURN FOR THE

                            INDIAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON. THIS MEASURE (PRESENCE OF IRAQI AND U.S.
                            DIPLOMATS), MADE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF SEVERED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
                            REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND THE U.S., IS BY NO MEANS A NOVEL MEASURE, HAVING
                            BEEN AGREED UPON SOME MONTHS AGO FOR THE SAKE OF PRESERVING THE
                            INTERESTS OF IRAQIS. AS IS CUSTOMARY IN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS.”</p>
                        <p>“THE SPOKESMAN CLARIFIED, "THE RUPTURE OF DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC
                            RELATIONS THEN RESORTED TO BY IRAQ AND OTHER ARAB STATES WAS DUE TO THE
                            U.S. BACKING OF THE ZIONIST AGGRESSION AND TO HER CONTINUED ANIMOSITY

                            POLITICAL, MATERIAL AND MILITARY SPHERES, IS ON THE INCREASE AND WITH
                            MOUNTING OBSTINATION AND COMPLETE ALIGNMENT WITH THE ENEMY AGAINST THE
                            INTERESTS AND RIGHTS OF THE ARAB NATION. IT IS NOT STRANGE, THEREFORE,
                            THAT THE U.S. SPOKESMAN COMES OUT WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND AT THIS
                            PARTICULAR TIME SINCE IT IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE U.S. MACHINATIONS
                            DESIGNED TO MISLEAD OUR ARAB MASSES WITH A VIEW TO SECURE PASSAGE TO
                            U.S. AGGRESSIVE GOALS AGAINST OUR JUST ISSUES, CHIEF AMONG WHICH IS THE
                            PALESTINE ISSUE. THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS ALSO AN ATTEMPT FOR A U.S.

                        </list>
                        <p>On September 19 a joint communique was issued in Moscow and Baghdad on
                            the occasion of the visit to Moscow of Iraqi President Hassan
                            al-Bakr.</p>
                        <p>The language of the communique indicates continued close Iraqi-Soviet
                            relations but no signs of a further strengthening of these ties. From
                            the make-up of the Iraqi delegation, it would appear that economic
                            cooperation and assistance were high on the agenda.</p>
                        <p>The most significant aspects of the communique concerning the Near East
                            are:</p>
                        <p>A. Declaration by both sides of their "continued material and moral
                            support and political and moral backing" for the Palestinian resistance
                            movement which the two sides "consider as an organic part of the Arab
                            nationalist liberation movement.”</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: This is not a new position for Iraq but would appear to mark a
                            further willingness on the part of the Soviets to back the fedayeen
                            movement in the belief that such support will win them friends among the
                            Arabs who presumably continue to consider the fedayeen movement as a
                            legitimate resistance organization.</p>
                        <p>B. Both sides reaffirmed that "a just and firm peace cannot be
                            established" in the Near East without "the liberation of all the
                            occupied territories.</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: This is equivocal language which in the Soviet view may mean
                            only those lands lost after the 1967 war but in the Iraqi mind might
                            well mean all of Palestine.</p>
                        <p>C. The two sides agreed on "tangible measures to continue to strengthen
                            the Iraqi Republic's military ability and to raise the fighting
                            standards of the armed forces.”</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: We assume that this means additional shipments of Soviet arms to
                            the Iraqi armed forces.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d324-02" facs="d324-02"/>
                        <p>D. Both sides denounced Israeli "acts of air piracy against Lebanese and
                            Syrian territory and also the armed aggression against southern
                            Lebanon.” The two sides concluded that this situation "threatens peace
                            in this area and in the whole world" as a result of "continued Israeli
                            aggression" and "continued political, military and financial support of
                            the U.S.”</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: This language is the standard Iraqi line which the Soviets are
                            obviously pandering to.</p>
                        <p>E. The Soviet Union "expressed its satisfaction" over the nationalization
                            of the “<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s monopolist oil operations"
                            as well as with the "steps which are being taken to fulfill the March 11
                            Manifesto regarding the peaceful and democratic settlement of the
                            Kurdish question.”</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: Nothing new here on the Soviet side.</p>

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> also reports that
                            the Baghdad regime and the Soviets are extremely concerned about the
                            independent course being followed by <pb n="2" xml:id="d325-02" facs="d325-02"/>
                            <persName>Barzani</persName>. Also, according to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, all is not well with the Bathist regime.</p>
                        <p>— Reduction of oil revenue is causing fiscal stringencies and some
                            discontent. <persName>Barzani</persName>'s maintenance of a secure
                            redoubt will continue to pin down two-thirds of the Iraqi army and
                            deprive the Bathists of a secure base from which to launch sabotage and
                            assassination teams against Iran.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I hope your visit will provide ample opportunity to discuss U.S. policy
                            toward Iraq and our general approach and tactics.</p>
                        <p>It hardly needs reiterating that Iraq will be of increasing interest to
                            the U.S. in the years ahead, as much for negative reasons as positive
                            ones. There are, of course, Mobil and Esso and Iraq's huge oil reserves
                            and even larger potential reserves (Jim Akins ranks it No. 2 in the
                            Middle East right behind Saudi Arabia). Yet the U.S. does not need Iraq
                            per se nor its oil. What we do need, I believe, is a semblance of
                            orderly development and stability over the next ten or twenty years in
                            the Gulf and Saudi Arabia to insure Western access to the oil. Iraq,
                            because of its geographic location, its role as a major oil producer,
                            and its political vulnerability, must, therefore, be of considerable
                            interest to us. This would be true even if the Soviets had not for the
                            same and additional reasons made it one of their major targets in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>What opportunities do we have? For the time being, they are very minimal.
                            The Baa'th regime is convinced we seek to overthrow them and they see
                            our relationship to the Shah, our policy in the Gulf, and our backing of
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, all in this context. Our first
                            task should, therefore, be to attempt to diabuse them of this erroneous
                            impression. It is a long term proposition for, in fact, U.S. policies in
                            the area do conflict with Baa'thi aspirations at almost every turn.</p>
                        <p>How do we begin building some mutuality of interests? I am convinced that
                            we should not be the ones to seek out opportunities and put them forward
                            to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. The more we bahave as a
                            suitor, the more suspicious they will become. Instead I would recommend
                            a posture in which we behave very correctly, ignore the violent
                            anti-Americanism of the media, and wait for opportunities to respond to
                            the Iraqi requests that are bound to come. When they do, we should
                            respond as handsomely and quickly as possible, regardless of the
                            importance of the particular request. We should make a point of
                            observing reciprocity in words, but in our actions we should be willing
                            to overlook some of their more erratic behavior. <pb n="2" xml:id="d326-02" facs="d326-02"/>It follows from the above that we
                            should be in no hurry to clear up the contentieux. Our respective
                            positions on the compound, for example, are so far apart that there is
                            little prospect of resolution until there is a strong desire for
                            improved relations. When and if the time comes to discuss the
                            contentieux, I hope we can show maximum flexibility and avoid laying
                            down conditions.</p>
                        <p>Finally, our presence here is not yet firm nor are the ground rules
                            established. (The Foreign Ministry cannot, for example, decide whether
                            or not to give us our own cable address.) Until we are established, it
                            is important that my reporting is not referred to by Department Officers
                            in speaking with the press or even in diplomatic exchanged. Should any
                            sensitive or adverse information about Iraq emanating from Washington
                            get back to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, it has many ways of
                            harassing us, and they would not hesitate to do so.</p>

                        <p>1. ON OCT. 30 ISRAELI COUNSELOR OF EMBASSY YOSEF BEN-AHARON CALLED ON
                            DEPTOFF TO RELAY INFORMATION FROM ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY CONCERNING
                            REPORTS OF RENEWED PERSECUTION OF IRAQI JEWS. ACCORDING TO ISRAELI
                            REPORTS, BEN-AHARON STATED THAT SOME TIME IN LATE SEPT. SEVEN MEMBERS OF
                            THE IRAQI JEWISH COMMUNITY DISAPPEARED. AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER MEMBER
                            OF COMMUNITY, WHICH BEN-AHARON SAID NOW NUMBERS APPROXIMATELY 250
                            PERSONS, WAS MURDERED IN HIS HOME. BEN-AHARON CONTINUED THAT IRAQI JEWS
                            NOW FEAR THAT IRAQI REGIME BEGINNING AGAIN TO PERSECUTE THEM.</p>
                        <p>2. BEN-AHARON ASKED IF USG HAD ANY CONFIRMATION OF THESE REPORTS TO WHICH
                            DEPTOFF REPLIED IN THE NEGATIVE. BEN-AHARON THEN ASKED WHAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO ON BEHALF OF IRAQI
                            JEWS, REMINDING DEPTOFF OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> EFFORTS IN 1971.</p>
                        <p>3. DEPTOFF EXPRESSED DEPARTMENT'S WILLINGNESS TO STUDY MATTER BUT
                            OBSERVED THAT AS WAS TRUE IN 1971, IT DIFFICULT FOR USG DO ANYTHING
                            DIRECTLY ON BEHALF OF IRAQI JEWS, DESPITE RECENT ARRIVAL IN BAGHDAD OF
                            TWO AMERICAN FSO'S AT THE U.S. INTERESTS SECTION. HE SUGGESTED THAT
                            ISRAELIS MIGHT WISH CONTACT OTHER POWERS, ESPECIALLY FRENCH WHO APPEAR
                            TO BE ONLY WESTERN STATE WHICH NOW ENJOYS SOME ACCESS IN BAGHDAD.
                            BEN-AHARON APPRECIATED DIFFICULTIES FACING USG. HE STATED THAT HIS
                            GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY DECIDED <pb n="2" xml:id="d327-02" facs="d327-02"/>TO APPROACH WESTERN EUROPEAN POWERS, BUT WONDERED IF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MIGHT BE WILLING SUPPORT THESE
                            APPROACHES. DEPTOFF PROMISED BEN-AHARON MATTER WOULD BE STUDIED ON
                            URGENT BASIS AND HE WOULD INFORM BEN-AHARON OF FINAL DECISION.</p>
                        <p>4. SAME INFORMATION CONCERNING PLIGHT OF IRAQI JEWS HAD BEEN CONVEYED
                            EARLIER SAME DAY BY GEORGE GRUEN, DIRECTOR, AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE,

                            CIRCUMSTANCES; AND INFORMED RAVIV THAT MEANWHILE US HAS AUTHORIZED OUR

                            AND TO EXPRESS U.S. SUPPORT OF ISRAELI EFFORTS TO INTEREST THEM IN THE

                        <p>6. ACTION POSTS REQUESTED APPROACH HOST GOVERNMENTS AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS

                            HAVE ON THIS SUBJECT; AND EXPRESS SUPPORT OF ISRAELI EFFORTS TO INTEREST

                            OF IRAQI JEWS, SHOULD CORROBORATIVE INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE.</p>

                        <p>Introduction: This is a very tentative assessment of the Iraqi regime
                            based on the only two-and-a-half months in the country and a total
                            reliance on secondary sources and the public media. It is long only
                            because it is the first such assessment from Baghdad in over five years.
                            Comments from end-users, who on some subjects may have better
                            information than available to <gloss target="#t_USINT1">USINT</gloss>,
                            are not just encouraged, but solicited.</p>
                        <p>I. The Internal Scene</p>
                        <p>The Baath regime, in power since July 1968, has achieved a semblance of
                            stability. The only organized opposition appears to be the Kurds who are
                            in physical control of a sizeable portion of territory along the Iranian
                            border. Public order is maintained elsewhere with apparent ease. Until
                            the June 1 nationalization, the economic growth rate was substantial
                                (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> in real terms rose at an annual
                            rate of 5.4% from 1966 to 1970 and much more rapidly in 1971). Although
                            no recent figures are available, the rigorous austerity measures do not
                            seem to have hurt the vast majority of Iraqis. This year's crops were
                            very good and some grain is being exported. Travel restriction have just
                            been lifted for the Haj and for the favored few, there are new Mercedes
                            (although officially banned) and something of a construction boom in
                            luxury residential housing.</p>
                        <p>The Iraqi people have, however, paid a price for the new stability. It
                            has been achieved through the application of increasingly effective
                            police state methods. Many able Iraqis have gone into exile and those
                            who remain live in a state of uncertainty and sometimes fear. Baghdad is
                            a city of whispered conversations and glances over the shoulder. A
                            recent incident gives a inkling of what it is like for an educated
                            Iraqi; Dr. Clement Sarkis, a prominent physician married to an
                            Englishwoman and a frequent guest at diplomatic functions, was picked up
                            by Ministry of Interior or Party security men on October 23 and held
                            incommunicado for ten days. After his release he refused to discuss his
                            incarceration except to say he had been questioned closely about his
                            foreign friends. The warning to the few remaining non-official Iraqis
                            who mix socially with foreigners is clear.</p>
                        <p>The Baath appears to have failed thus far to gain wide popular support
                            and the regime rests on the twin pillars of Party and Army. Party
                            members are still organized in secret cells and are believed to number
                            about 100,000; i.e. 1% of the population. Many more are believed to be
                            part of the Party's system of informers. In addition to assassinations,
                            the party is rumored to eliminate its dissident members or other enemies
                            by such means as staged automobile accidents. The most recent "accident"
                            occurred on November 14 and involved two Syrian "comrades" who were
                            given an elaborate mourning procession and then flown with full honors
                            to Damascus. The Army is very much in evidence and obviously well
                            treated, but this is not a new phenomena in Iraq. The military has
                            practically no contact with Westerners and even routine contacts with
                            Western military attaches must go through a liaison office. The
                            Communist attaches and advisors are also believed to be kept at arms
                            length. Information on the role of the Baath within the Army and on
                            attitudes within the officer corps is virtually impossible to obtain
                            here.</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> Conflict</p>
                        <p>The major issue facing the regime at this time is the conflict with
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> resulting from the June 1
                            nationalization. The regime is trying to convey the impression that
                            things are going much better than hoped: i.e. the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> oil is being sold (without mentioning
                            that a large percentage of it is going to <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s consent),
                            the country is fully behind the nationalization (which is probably
                            true), Iraq has many foreign friends, and if things don't work out,
                            there is a rapidly expanding market for oil in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The consensus of Western observers
                            is, however, that the regime would like an early settlement that not
                            only resolved the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> nationalization,
                            but also North Rumaila, BPC and in addition brought in substantial new
                            investment. The alternative to a settlement with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> is dismal, at least in the near term: having Iraqi oil
                            pursued throughout the world; more barter arrangements; and a greater
                            dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than desired.
                            Yet no one here discounts this possibility. The leaders of the regime do
                            not believe they can surrender to <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            and survive. A dangerous reorientation of the economy may be the lesser
                            of two evils.</p>
                        <p>B. The Kurdish Problem</p>
                        <p>After a two-and-one-half year truce, rumors were wide-spread during
                            November of possible new fighting between the Army and the Kurds. It was
                            believed here that the tension resulted from the Kurds taking advantage
                            of the regime's difficulties to press their demands for implementation
                            of the March 1970 agreement. To give weight to their demands they
                            probably instigated the army desertions and other incidents. The regime
                            responded by opening a public debate - one of the freest in local memory
                            - over differing interpretations of the March agreement. The Baath
                            accused the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> of cooperating with Iran
                            and Israel and the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> accused the Baath
                            of bad faith, covert anti-Kurdish activities, and monopolizing power.
                            The debate did serve to redefine the issues and perhaps with the
                            assistance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which is active
                            as the intermediary, progress toward a modus vivendi that excludes
                            fighting can be made. Neither side seems to want a renewal of large
                            scale fighting, but neither is there sufficient mutual confidence to
                            bring about the implementation of the agreement. Outlook: continued
                            stalemate with minor incidents.</p>
                        <p>C. The National Front</p>
                        <p>The regime is having rough sledding in creating the National Front in
                            accordance with the draft National Charter issues on November 1, 1971.
                            The Iraqi Communist Party approved and has been rewarded with two
                            ministers (Irrigation and without Portfolio). The <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> has refused to sign the Charter because
                            it claims inter alia that participation in the government is meaningless
                            as long as all executive and legislative power rests with the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is actively pushing the establishment of a National
                            Front, as evinced by the large number of foreign Communist delegations
                            that have visited Iraq in the past few months to bestow official
                            blessing on the Baath as a progressive party worthy of party-to-party
                            relationships.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> shows no signs of giving in on
                            the crucial issue of meaningful participation and without the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> a National Front would be fairly
                            meaningless.</p>
                        <p>III. External Affairs</p>
                        <p>A. The Arabs</p>
                        <p>The regime has been more successful in breaking out of its isolation
                            internationally than domestically. Within the Arab world, for example,
                            Iraq is now developing new relationships with as diverse states as
                            Algeria and the Sudan and attempting a rapproachment with Saudi Arabia.
                            President Bakr even sent King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> a birthday greeting on November 14. Serious
                            differences still exist with Syria over oil transit payments and
                            personal rivalries among Baath leaders. In the Arabian Gulf tradition
                            methods of diplomacy seem to be the order of the day rather than the
                            subversive ones.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d328-02" facs="d328-02"/>
                        <p>B. The Soviet Threat</p>
                        <p>Relations with the Soviet Union and other <gloss target="#t_COMECON1">COMECON</gloss> countries have increased most substantially since
                            nationalization and credits and loans now total $775 Million. The Iraqi
                            request for observer status with COMPCON is seen here as both a
                            bargaining gambit with the West and an indication that Iraq does not
                            again intend to become so dependent on the West. Relations with the
                            Soviet Union, however, go well beyond economics as demonstrated by the
                            very active Soviet role in all three of the major domestic issues facing
                            the regime (see above). While the French Ambassador is most eloquent on
                            the Soviet threat, perhaps to facilitate his mission, the consensus of
                            Western Ambassadors is that Iraq and the Gulf have become major targets
                            for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The areas of
                            concentration are the oil sector, the military, irrigation, and the
                            development of an Iraqi fishing fleet to ply the Arab Gulf and the
                            Indian Ocean (Baghdad 56). More ominous is the close Communist
                            relationship with the Ministry of Interior and Party security
                            apparatuses. The December 3 formal agreement between the Czech and Iraqi
                            Ministries of Interior is, as the Iraqi Mister said, "only bringing the
                            existing relationship into the open”.</p>
                        <p>We should not be lulled into complacency about the Soviet threat by the
                            fact that Arab states elsewhere have proved relatively impervious to a
                            dominant Russian presence. Iraq may be different. Few Arab countries are
                            as culturally diverse and therefore capable of being controlled by a
                            small, militant minority. For Russia, Iraq is geographically the closest
                            Arab country. Its concrete interests here are substantial (oil, Indian
                            Ocean, border security). The Soviets may not wish to gain direct control
                            over the levers of power, but we should not discount this possibility.
                            One could not help but be struck by the statement in a recent editorial
                            in the official al-Jumhuriya that "Iraq and India form the foundation of
                            the progressive front in Asia.”</p>
                        <p>C. Relations With the West</p>
                        <p>Although relations with the West are somewhat in abeyance pending the
                            outcome of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> conflict, Iraq is
                            seeking to expand these ties. France continues to be courted openly, but
                            the French Ambassador maintains that no new commitments are being made,
                            despite the commercial loss entailed, pending a settlement. If
                            negotiations fail, France will be faced with a cruel choice of breaking
                            with its <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> partners or losing its
                            incipient "special position" here.</p>
                        <p>President al-<persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> received the new
                            Canadian Ambassador on November 28 and insisted that the West had forced
                            Iraq toward the Communist world. The Ambassador was later informed that
                            Iraq had named an Ambassador to Ottawa despite the knowledge that Canada
                            could not reciprocate. Greece and Brazil will establish Embassies here
                            early next year, partly at Iraqi urging. Visa restriction for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> citizens were recently eased and
                            commercial relations with Great Britain proceed about normally. The
                            media is speaking less about "Western imperialism" and more about
                            "American imperialism" and suggesting that the EEC countries are
                            prepared to break with the past and establish a new relationship with
                            the Arabs at Israel's expense, whereas U.S. support for Israel is more
                            determined than ever. The U.S. is vilified daily on other issues as
                            well—from Vietnam to crime, much of it is obviously fed in from
                            Communist sources. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s treatment
                            of <gloss target="#t_USINT1">USINT</gloss> has been correct, but we have
                            not yet detected any hint of a desire for improved relations. Iraqis in
                            general studiously avoid contact with <gloss target="#t_USINT1">USINT</gloss> officers.</p>

                        <p>IRAQ'S ROLE IN MIDDLE EASTERN PROBLEMS<lb/> CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. Iraq is a factor in many Middle East problems. Geography, economics,
                            and ideology stimulate tendencies toward activism in foreign policy, but
                            these have been swamped in recent years by domestic concerns-notably
                            squabbles within the Baath Party hierarchy and the simmering dispute
                            with the Kurds in northern Iraq. In general Iraq's foreign relations
                            have been troubled, in large part because of its extreme and unbending
                            pan-Arab radicalism. This and preoccupation with domestic concerns have
                            produced a degree of isolation, which continues, though in somewhat
                            modified form, in the present atmosphere of laissez-faire in intra-Arab
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>B. Iraq and Iran see each other as major antagonists. They are in
                            conflict over rights in the Shatt al Arab boundary river and are rivals
                            for influence in the smaller Gulf states. Baghdad is also troubled by
                            Iranian aid to Kurdish rebels. Hence, the arms race between Iraq and
                            Iran will continue, though the Iraqis have a healthy respect for Iranian
                            military superiority and are likely to refrain from escalating
                            incidents. Moreover, the Iraqi aim of establishing political influence
                            in the Gulf is not likely to meet with much success since Iraqi assets
                            and capabilities are limited and are outclassed by those of Iran and
                            Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d330-02" facs="d330-02"/>
                        <p>C. Relations between Syria and Iraq are seriously marred by the hostility
                            of the two Baath parties. The states are also in dispute over the
                            transit fees for Iraqi oil shipped through Syrian pipelines and the
                            division of the Euphrates waters which are being dammed by both
                            countries. While in time these problems are likely to be resolved on
                            terms relatively favorable to Syria-which has the whip hand-there seems
                            little prospect of general rapprochement between the regimes.</p>
                        <p>D. Relations with other Arab states are not particularly cordial.
                            Although the Baath regime has publicly supported the fedayeen movement,
                            it has not permitted it to engage in significant activities in Iraq.
                            While Iraq would speak out against any Arab state moving to negotiate
                            with Israel, it probably would attempt very little, if any, action
                            against such states.</p>
                        <p>E. The Baath leaders feel the need to maintain, indeed, to expand, their
                            oil revenue and do not appear to regard oil as a practical weapon to
                            obtain political gain from the West. They moved to nationalize the
                            Western owned Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) in June 1972 only after the latter reduced oil output
                            and, hence, income, but they did not touch its affiliates. Negotiations
                            between <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and Baghdad are continuing
                            and the Iraqis seem inclined to settle for terms generally as profitable
                            for the companies as their deals with other Gulf producers. But this
                            would be a tricky business and would require obfuscation of the terms so
                            Baghdad could claim victory. If this effort failed, the parties might
                            prefer a tacit arrangement to freeze the dispute at its present
                            stage.</p>
                        <p>F. The Soviets have had a long-time interest in Iraq and the Persian Gulf
                            area, but the initiative for the 1972 treaty of friendship seems to have
                            been taken by the Iraqis. The Soviets welcomed the treaty and see
                            additional psychological benefit from it since Sadat ousted Soviet
                            advisors from Egypt. They realize, however, that their relations with
                            Baghdad irritate Iran, whose goodwill Moscow values highly. While Moscow
                            in time may seek more extensive use of Iraqi ports, overflight rights,
                            and possible use of Iraqi airfields for staging, it will probably move
                            very gradually in this direction. The Baath leaders value Soviet
                            military aid and are unlikely to jeopardize it by abruptly reducing the
                            number of advisors, as Sadat did.</p>

                        <p>G. The Baath government sees no particular benefit in significantly
                            improving relations with the US. The US recently sent American personnel
                            to its interests section in Baghdad, a move which had some practical
                            advantages for Iraq and could be made without fanfare; it does not
                            presage further progress toward restoring diplomatic ties.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d330-04" facs="d330-04"/>
                        <p>THE ESTIMATE</p>
                        <p>1. Iraq is a very different country today from what it was in 1958 when a
                            revolutionary upheaval overturned the monarchy and set up a radical Arab
                            nationalist regime. Despite the strong pan-Arab cast to the ideology of
                            many of the inexperienced nationalist officers who dominated Iraq,
                            domestic problems proved so difficult and so persistent that successive
                            regimes were forced to turn inward.</p>
                        <p>2. It was not solely the extent of problems at home, however, that made
                            Iraq's position so isolated in the 1960s. The period was one of intense
                            rivalries between Arab states which NASSER's fading leadership failed to
                            mollify. The young Iraqi republic, though its leaders varied, was
                            through much of this period the most dogmatic and most ideologically
                            motivated of the Arab states. The result was often irritation and
                            hostility, even between Iraq and other radical states. Since NASSER's
                            death, however, relations between Arab states have changed in character;
                            indeed there is something of a spirit of laissez-faire.</p>
                        <p>I. IRAQ SINCE THE REVOLUTION</p>
                        <p>3. Iraq has never been an easy country to govern, with its large Kurdish
                            minority living in the hills in the north and the Arab majority divided
                            between the Shiite and Sunni branches of Islam. Sunni Arabs, who number
                            only about a quarter of the total population have consistently dominated
                            the government. By breaking down central authority the revolution
                            compounded the problem of administering the diverse groups. The former
                            ruling clique-wealthy, often foreign educated, and accustomed to look to
                            the West for support-has either emigrated or lost its positions of
                            power. Republican regimes have had to rebuild the governing apparatus
                            almost from scratch, a process hampered by recurrent shifts of
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>4. Confronted with these difficulties and lacking wide acceptance of
                            their legitimacy, governments since 1958 have generally adopted harsh
                            repressive tactics against all opponents. Rivals have been jailed,
                            exiled, or even murdered. Regimes have encouraged and manipulated mob
                            violence against their enemies. <pb n="5" xml:id="d330-05" facs="d330-05"/>And the cumulative weight of these violent tactics
                            has engendered a general fear of informers that pervades Iraqi life.
                            Nonetheless, the effectiveness of government controls is mitigated by
                            administrative inefficiency, and the regime has allowed some emigrees ta
                            pay brief visits to their homeland.</p>
                        <p>5. Successive revolutionary regimes have had only modest success in
                            improving living conditions of the populace. While the economy has grown
                            at an average annual rate of about five percent in recent years, the
                            rewards have not been evenly distributed. Initial efforts to improve the
                            lot of the peasants by confiscating large private landholdings caused
                            extensive disruption. Some of the ill effects have been overcome, but
                            much land remains in government hands and agricultural output has failed
                            to keep pace with population growth. Industrial and commercial activity,
                            mostly in government hands, has lagged, but over the past 15 years a
                            substantial amountof economic infrastructure in the form of
                            communications, public utilities, and public hous ing has been built.
                            And the governments havehad large inflows of foreign cash from oil to
                            bolster the economy and avoid major crises.</p>
                        <p>6. Nationalization of the Iraq Petroleum Company (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) in June 1972, however, curtailed oil output, causing
                            Iraq a loss of some $130 million in revenues in the following six
                            months. Thus far, Iraq has received somewhere between $50 and $90
                            million in loans principally from Libya and Kuwait to help make up the
                            loss. To conserve foreign exchange, the government cut imports sharply,
                            including those for development projects. Although by late 1972 Iraq was
                            again receiving oil revenues roughly equal to the average receipts of
                            the previous year, the government has refused to relax the austerity
                            measures that are causing hardships in the domestic economy. Government
                            workers are subjected to forced savings; cuts in imports have resulted
                            in shortages of consumer and capital goods. Most important for the long
                            run, the development program, which was just beginning to show some real
                            progress in such fields as irrigation projects and industrial
                            development, has been sharply reduced.</p>
                        <p>II. MAJOR DOMESTIC PREOCCUPATIONS</p>
                        <p>7. The Baath (1) Party of Iraq-in power since July 1968-is part of a
                            pan-Arab ideological movement founded over a quarter century ago in
                            Syria. The leaders of the Iraqi party are more wedded to pan-Arabism and
                            since 1966 have had apparently irreconcilable personal differences with
                            those at the head of the Syrian party. Indeed, personality has often
                            been more important than ideology in setting specific policies of the
                            Baghdad regime. Military support was essential to the Baath's success in
                            seizing power in Baghdad and remains a key element. But the Iraqi armed
                            forces, unlike those in Syria, have been reduced in importance in the
                            equation of power. The Iraqi civilian leaders have purged the officer
                            corps, while raising its pay. They have also brought a number of
                            dedicated party members into the military. There remains, however, a
                            military faction in the Baath and probably a non-Baath or anti-Baath
                            faction in the military forces.</p>
                        <p>(1) Baath means resurrection or rebirth in Arabic.</p>
                        <p>8. Committed to monopolizing power, the present Baath leadership, during
                            its four years of rule, has managed to curb or destroy political
                            dissidents except for the Kurdish nationalists in the northern mountain
                            fastness. In this situation, strife among the Baath leaders appears to
                            be the primary threat to continued stable rule. Within the Baath Party,
                            the civilian faction under <persName corresp="#p_HTS1">Saddam Husayn al
                                Takriti</persName>, Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary <pb n="6" xml:id="d330-06" facs="d330-06"/>Command Council, has been in the
                            ascendant, but there are continuing signs of friction between this
                            clique and that of President Hasan al Bakr who has had closer ties with
                            the military wing of the Party. Saddam Takriti is being criticized for
                            problems stemming from increasing friction with the Kurds, the
                            nationalization of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, failures to
                            secure late-model arms from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            and intrigue over plans to form a National Front. President <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName> seems to be infiltrating personnel
                            loyal to him into sensitive positions in the regime. It is hard to judge
                            how this factional infighting will turn out. But sooner or later this
                            conflict seems likely to come to a head, producing a major reshuffle in
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>9. Should these internal disputes lead to the ouster of Saddam Takriti
                            and his supporters by <persName corresp="#p_BAH4">BAKR</persName>'s
                            clique, the armed forces would undoubtedly again play a greater role in
                            the political process. But the policies of the regime might not change
                            greatly. Such a break in the revolutionary ranks, however, would weaken
                            central authority and might promote additional military plotting. This
                            might even raise the chances of a coup by a non-Baath group in the
                            military, although the regime's principal intelligence arm-the so-called
                            Public Relations Bureau-is said to have "watchdogs" in military units.
                            Despite these and other efforts over the past few years to turn the
                            military establishment into a Baath preserve, it seems likely that
                            especially among lower and middle ranking officers a number of non-party
                            members remain. Lacking information on the loyalty and outlook of these
                            officers as we do, it is not possible to suggest with confidence what
                            changes a non-Baath regime would make. But it is virtually certain that
                            in this case military officers would be dominant and that they would
                            govern in the authoritarian manner of previous regimes.</p>
                        <p>The Kurdish Stalemate</p>
                        <p>10. Like their predecessors, the Baath leaders have found the Kurdish
                            problem difficult. Most of the Kurdish districts of northern Iraq have
                            been outside of effective control by the central authorities for a
                            decade. Extensively supported by Iran-and Israel-the charismatic Mulla
                            Mustafa Barzani has successfully overcome traditional tribal rivalries
                            to weld disparate Kurdish groups into a more or less homogeneous
                            movement capable of standing off Baghdad's thrusts. After repeated
                            failures to reimpose its authority by force of arms, the Baath
                            government in March 1970-with Saddam Takriti reputed to be the chief
                            architect-reluctantly brought itself to offer
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> and his Kurdish Democratic Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>) a generous settlement,
                            providing for a wide measure of autonomy for the Kurds in their areas.
                            (2) This ended open warfare, but has not provided genuine peace.</p>
                        <p>(2) The most important provisions of the agreement call for delimitation
                            of the Kurdish area, a Kurdish Vice President, a national census to
                            determine Kurdish representation in any future legislature, and Kurdish
                            control of security forces in the designated Kurdish area.</p>
                        <p>11. Tension is again rising in relations between Baghdad and the Kurds.
                            The Baath government has never fully lived up to the terms agreed in
                            1970. There is little prospect that it will. In fact, the Baath
                            government still would like to bring the Kurdish areas under its direct
                            control. To this end, it continues to intrigue against
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> in hopes of splitting the Kurds.
                            Recently there have been renewed clashes between Baghdad's forces and
                            the Kurds. (3) But although the government is losing patience with
                                <persName>Barzani</persName>, it has not succumbed <pb n="7" xml:id="d330-07" facs="d330-07"/>to the temptation to reopen
                            full-scale hostilities. The Baghdad leaders apparently recognize their
                            present inability to carry military action to a successful conclusion
                            against <persName>Barzani</persName>. They may also hope that time will
                            increase the strains within the Kurdish movement, providing better
                            opportunities to end the autonomy of the north at some later date.
                            Further, the Soviets are no doubt counseling forebearance.</p>
                        <p>(3) Serious fighting is impossible in winter when heavy snowfall makes
                            the Kurdish area impassable. Only in the period May through October is
                            weather suitable for major military ground action in the Kurdish
                            region.</p>
                        <p>12. For his part, <persName>Barzani</persName> bitterly mistrusts the
                            Baath government which has made several attempts on his life. He
                            continues to search for outside support and would like direct assistance
                            from the US to complement the weapons, money, and military instructors
                            received from Israel and Iran. <persName>Barzani</persName> is
                            dissatisfied with the present stalemate, but on the whole finds it less
                            onerous than open warfare. His Kurdish defense forces, equipped only
                            with light arms, lack the capability for sustained warfare outside of
                            their mountain sanctuaries. They can exploit rugged terrain of the north
                            to push back attacks, but cannot carry the war to Baghdad. Moreover,
                            renewed hostilities would not be popular with the Kurds who suffered
                            especially from air attacks in previous campaigns.</p>
                        <p>13. While the present stalemate may well hold for some time, it is
                            inherently fragile. Given present tensions, small-scale clashes of the
                            sort that have taken place in past months seem inevitable, especially
                            after the end of the enforced immobility of the winter season. This will
                            pose a continuing challenge to the Baath regime and form a ready pretext
                            for broader hostilities.</p>
                        <p>14. Baghdad feels other grievances against the Kurds as well.
                                <persName>Barzani</persName> has proved unresponsive to Soviet
                            urging to join the Communist Party of Iraq as a second junior member of
                            a National Front dominated by the Baath. (There is little chance that
                            the Kurds will agree to participate as long as Baghdad does not meet the
                            terms of the 1970 agreement.) This undoubtedly irritates the Baath
                            leadership and may also be weakening the interest of the Kremlin in
                            providing diplomatic support to the Kurds. Any diminution of Soviet
                            concern about the fate of the Kurds would also encourage the Baath
                            regime to revive the war. In any event, there is only miniscule prospect
                            that relations between <persName>Barzani</persName> and the Baath will
                            improve. And the Kurdish problem will almost certainly remain a
                            constraint on the freedom of action at home and abroad of any Iraqi
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>15. The chances for a resumption of full-scale fighting would increase
                            sharply with the departure of <persName>Barzani</persName>. Now about
                            70, <persName>Barzani</persName> seems in relatively good health.
                            Suspicious as he is of Baghdad's good faith-with reason-he is not likely
                            to put himself within reach of the Baath Party regime. But when he
                            leaves the scene, there is no one in the Kurdish camp who could play his
                            unifying role. Without <persName>Barzani</persName>, the effectiveness
                            of the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss> would be questionable. It
                            would probably be challenged by Jelal Talabani, once the second ranking
                            figure in the <gloss target="#t_KDP1">KDP</gloss>. Expelled from the
                            party in 1964, he heads a younger, more radical group whose progressive
                            social views are antipathetic to the traditional Kurdish tribal order.
                            Moreover, without Barzani's commanding presence, tribal rivalries would
                            be likely to come to the fore again. Such disunity among the Kurds would
                            powerfully tempt almost any regime in Baghdad to attempt to reimpose its
                            authority. And under these circumstances, an early resumption of warfare
                            would become likely.</p>
                        <p>III. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORING STATES</p>
                        <p>16. More than preceding Iraqi regimes, the Baath government in Baghdad
                            has ideological-as well as national-aspirations in the Arab world.
                            Believing deeply in their version <pb n="8" xml:id="d330-08" facs="d330-08"/>of pan-Arab socialism, some Baath leaders would like
                            to export their "progressive" approach to their fellow Arabs. But the
                            Baath in Baghdad has encountered both resistance and apathy in its
                            endeavors abroad. The Arab world appears to be going through a cycle of
                            fragmentation-each country emphasizing national concerns and giving
                            diminished attention to matters of larger Arab interest. Even the Iraqi
                            Baath Party seems to be losing some of its resolve to promote pan-Arab
                            designs.</p>
                        <p>17. In part, the Baghdad regime is constrained by the weakness of its
                            armed forces. Intense political involvements and extensive purges have
                            lowered the quality and training of Iraqi military personnel. This, more
                            than the amount and characteristics of equipment, severely limits
                            military effectiveness. The Iraqi Armed Forces have little offensive
                            capability. They are overshadowed by the Iranian military establishment
                            on the ground, at sea, and especially in the air. Iraq could defeat
                            Kuwait militarily as long as the latter did not receive external help,
                            from say the Iranians. Logistical considerations would make it difficult
                            for Iraq to carry out military action against the relatively defenseless
                            states of the Gulf coast. The Baghdad government probably recognizes
                            something of its weakness and seems unlikely to attempt major military
                            action to accomplish its regional designs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dispute with Iran</p>
                        <p>18. Iraq and Iran see one another as major antagonists. Relations between
                            the two were poisoned following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy.
                            Each side is now convinced of the malevolence and untrustworthiness of
                            the other. This mistrust has been fanned by simmering dispute over
                            sovereignty in the Shatt al Arab waterway. (See map.) The Shah has
                            denounced the 1937 agreement which accorded Iraq complete control of
                            this important boundary river; and Iran has taken military measures to
                            enforce its claims to navigational rights. Another source of trouble has
                            been Iranian assistance to <persName>Barzani</persName>, of which the
                            Baath leaders are well aware. Both Baghdad and Tehran have undertaken to
                            sponsor subversion against the other-e.g., Tehran's abortive coup
                            attempt in January 1970 and Baghdad's assistance to Iranian terrorists.
                            And the two countries are also rivals for influence in the smaller
                            states on the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>19. There is little prospect for early improvement in relations between
                            Iraq and Iran. The Shah's ambitions for a dominant role in the area and
                            his plans to modernize and expand his armed forces will cause concern in
                            the Baath leadership. These plans, which he justifies partly as a
                            response to what he perceives as the threat from Iraq, will further
                            stimulate Baghdad to seek equipment in the USSR. Likewise, continuing
                            Soviet assistance to the Iraqi Armed Forces will only boost the Shah's
                            determination to maintain regional military superiority. The Iraqi
                            leaders have a healthy respect for the Shah's military edge and have
                            backed down from military confrontation whenever large-scale action
                            seemed likely. This caution is likely to persist even in the face of
                            provocations by the Shah. We do not think Iran is likely to initiate
                            major military action against Iraq.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ambitions in the Gulf</p>
                        <p>20. Iraqi regimes have long nourished designs to play a larger role in
                            the Gulf. Abdul Karim Qasim, leader of the 1958 revolution, advanced
                            claims to Kuwait, precipitating fears that he was preparing for military
                            action to enforce his demands. After his overthrow, however, the
                            short-lived 1963 Baath regime in Baghdad renounced these claims and
                            succeeding governments have not revived them. While the present Baath
                            government has been attempting to establish a commercial as well as a
                            political influence in the area, it clearly <pb n="9" xml:id="d330-09" facs="d330-09"/>is not willing to commit a large share of its
                            resources to that end. The Iraqis appear to be making Bahrain their
                            center of operations. The Baath regime is also in contact with dissident
                            groups, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied
                            Arab Gulf, which are seeking to overthrow the traditionalist governments
                            of the smaller Gulf states.</p>
                        <p>21. Thus far, Iraqi subversive activity has not met great success. The
                            Baghdad regime's desire to establish formal relations with the emerging
                            Gulf states has kept it from openly pursuing propaganda attacks on these
                            conservative regimes. Moreover, in the quest for influence Iraq is far
                            outclassed by the wealth and proximity of Iran and Saudi Arabia. Despite
                            these problems, Baghdad is wedded to its image as a revolutionary power.
                            Hence, it seems almost certain to continue to support subversion in low
                            key with money and arms. But under the circumstances Baghdad is not
                            likely to score much success.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Syrian-Iraqi Relations</p>
                        <p>22. There is little love lost between the ruling Baath parties in Iraq
                            and Syria. Baghdad has harbored Syrian dissidents and has pressed the
                            more pragmatic Syrian party to acknowledge Iraqi primacy. At the same
                            time, under Soviet prodding, the Iraqi regime has made tentative
                            overtures to Damascus to compose their general differences. But
                            Baghdad's terms are not acceptable to the Syrian leaders, who have
                            little to gain by closer ties with Iraq.</p>
                        <p>23. Relations are further ruffled by a dispute over transit fees for oil
                            shipped through the Syrian segment of the now nationalized <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> pipeline. Iraq is resisting Syrian
                            demands for sharply higher fees, which could significantly reduce its
                            profit on oil from the northern fields. Meetings on this issue between
                            Damascus and Baghdad have been unavailing. Meanwhile, Syria is letting
                            the oil flow in hopes eventually of receiving a better settlement. While
                            Damascus is not being paid pending agreement, it probably has the whip
                            hand as there is no other outlet for oil from the northern fields. And
                            eventually economic pressures will probably lead the parties to a
                            resolution of this dispute in which Syria would receive higher fees than
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> paid.</p>
                        <p>24. There seems little likelihood, however, of general rapprochement
                            between Syria and Iraq as long as the present leaders remain in power in
                            either country. The Syrians are tilting toward Cairo these days. Not
                            only does this decrease their interest in improving relations with
                            Baghdad; it poses difficulties for the Iraqis who are usually suspicious
                            of Cairo. The chances for reconciliation are further dimmed by other
                            contentious issues, such as the use of Euphrates waters. This matter
                            will become particularly urgent when the large Syrian dam now under
                            construction is finished. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            which gives considerable economic aid to dam and reclamation projects in
                            both countries, has urged better cooperation on river development. While
                            in the end the parties will no doubt reach some agreement, the process
                            is not apt to be smooth and there will probably be mutual recriminations
                            for some time to come.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Arab Regimes</p>
                        <p>25. Iraqi relations with other Arab states are not as frigid as they have
                            been at times past, but neither are they particularly cordial. Baghdad
                            and King Husayn have no special bone to pick since the Iraqi forces
                            withdrew from their forward bases in Jordan near the ceasefire line with
                            Israel. These forces had complicated the King's efforts to bring the
                            fedayeen under control, and Husayn is still suspicious of Iraq. Despite
                            general antipathy to monarchies, the Baath leaders seem to have come to
                            something of a modus vivendi with the Saudi Arabian Government. But this
                            could <pb n="10" xml:id="d330-10" facs="d330-10"/>be vitiated if the
                            Iraqis became more active in the Gulf, for Riyadh is extremely
                            suspicious of Iraqi intentions in this area. The Baath leaders are happy
                            that NASSER is gone from Egypt, and they are especially pleased at
                            Sadat's preoccupation with Egyptian affairs. Yet Egypt still looms for
                            them as a rival, and no warmth is likely to develop in their
                            relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Arab-Israeli Dispute</p>
                        <p>26. Iraq has always talked tough on the question of Israel, but is far
                            from the battle lines and has managed to be relatively little involved
                            in actual fighting. From the end of the 1967 war until 1971, Baghdad did
                            station a force of about 20,000 men-one-fifth of its armed forces-in
                            Jordan and a few thousand in Syria to show solidarity with the Arab
                            cause. These gestures, however, represented small sacrifice for the
                            Baath regime, which used such assignments in part as a form of dignified
                            exile for officers of suspected loyalty. And once King Husayn had broken
                            the power of the fedayeen in Jordan in September 1970, the Iraqis, after
                            initial indecision, began to withdraw their forces. Indeed, while paying
                            lip service to the fedayeen cause, Baghdad has avoided being drawn into
                            a leading role in this issue. Although the Baath regime has publicly
                            supported the fedayeen movement, it has not permitted it to engage in
                            significant activities in Iraq.</p>
                        <p>27. Baghdad's hard line against Israel is certain to continue. The Iraqis
                            reject <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution 242 and adamantly
                            oppose concessions to Israel as part of a settlement. Baghdad would
                            clearly speak out-as it has in the past-against any moves toward
                            Egyptian and Jordanian negotiations with Israel. But it probably would
                            attempt very little, if any, concrete action against these states if
                            they decided to try to reach a settlement with Israel, and, in any case,
                            probably has few assets to employ against them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Turkey</p>
                        <p>28. Except for a short interval under Qasim, Iraqi governments have
                            traditionally maintained good relations with Turkey. Both states have a
                            common interest in keeping the lid on Kurdish dissidence. They also
                            share interest in arriving at equitable arrangements for the use of the
                            Euphrates waters. Bilateral talks have been held on this matter over the
                            past few years, though final resolution of this problem is not likely
                            for some time. A recent exchange of high-level visits has confirmed the
                            good relationship between the states, and there is no reason to expect
                            significant change in the near future.</p>
                        <p>IV. OIL</p>
                        <p>29. Iraq's stature and international role are very much bound up with the
                            development of its large oil resources. Management of this critical
                            resource, which generates more than a third of Iraq's gross national
                            product and more than three-fourths of all government revenues, has been
                            a major challenge to the Baath Party regime. In its approach to this
                            problem, the party is generally governed more by its appreciation of
                            market factors and the laws of supply and demand than by the imperatives
                            of its socialist ideology. The Baath leaders recognize the need to
                            preserve, indeed, to expand, the flow of oil revenue which is an
                            all-important prop of the regime. No Iraqi Government of any stripe has
                            yet shut down oil production, although Iraq briefly boycotted sales to
                            some Western nations immediately after the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict.
                            The Baath regime does not appear to regard oil as a practical weapon for
                            obtaining gain from the West.</p>

                        <p>30. Iraq's nationalization of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>,
                            which operated the large producing fields in the north, came only after
                            more than a decade of running dispute over concession rights, beginning
                            with Iraqi seizure of 99 percent of the concession area in 1961. These
                            differences had curtailed investment in new facilities, slowing the rate
                            of increase in oil output to half that for the Middle East as a whole
                            over the past decade. In fact, most of the growth in oil production in
                            Iraq in recent years has come from maximizing the use of facilities that
                            existed before 1961. Moreover, given prevailing tanker costs, shipment
                            through the pipeline to the Mediterranean had become more expensive than
                            through the Persian Gulf. These factors had induced <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> to cut back production, an action which
                            in June 1972 provoked nationalization of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> Kirkuk fields in northern Iraq. The government did not
                            touch the Basra Petroleum Company's sizable field in the south, nor even
                            the small Mosul field in the north, though both were operated by
                            affiliates of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>31. Oil production was sharply curtailed immediately following
                            nationalization, but Iraqi efforts to arrange alternative supply
                            contracts have been relatively successful. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> itself contributed to the easing of the crisis by
                            agreeing to suspend legal action against purchasers of oil produced from
                            its Kirkuk concession until there had been time to negotiate a
                            compromise solution. The original time limit for these talks has been
                            extended until the end of 1972. Meanwhile, Baghdad has concluded
                            provisional arrangements to sell oil to the Compagnie Francaise de
                            Petroles (<gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss>), a major shareholder of
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Iraq has also concluded deals
                            to supply Greece, Italy, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and
                            East European states with oil from the nationalized fields. Iraq is now
                            shipping about 800,000 barrels a day to the Mediterranean through a
                            pipeline system which has a capacity of about 1.2 million.</p>
                        <p>32. Iraqi's success in disposing of these quantities of oil has depended
                            in part on the cooperation of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Its
                            prospects for sharp increases in sales-with concomitant increases in
                            revenue-appear to hinge on reaching some agreement with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. While the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and East Europe are presently assisting Iraq to
                            develop its North Rumaila field, they are neither prepared nor able to
                            dispose of large quantities of oil. (4) In the short run, Soviet ports
                            and distribution facilities are not oriented toward receiving or
                            trans-shipping oil from abroad. Also, both Moscow and East Europe suffer
                            from foreign exchange constraints that would complicate such deals.
                            Principally, however, it would be the difficulty for the Communist
                            countries to arrange for the marketing of Iraqi oil that would
                            discourage them from a major attempt to supplant <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. They are probably also concerned about the possible
                            decrease of their own oil revenues and damage to their reputation as
                            reliable members of the international commercial community.</p>
                        <p>(4) A more comprehensive discussion of this issue will be forthcoming in
                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 3-73, "International Petroleum
                            Prospects”, to be issued early in 1973.</p>
                        <p>33. Iraq's dependence on the Western oil companies is all the greater
                            because it has not received wholehearted support from its Persian Gulf
                            neighbors in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. These
                            countries are making arrangements with the international oil companies
                            that promise an uninterrupted supply of oil to world customers at terms
                            tolerable to both producers and sellers. Though over the long run,
                            international demand for oil will make increased production from Iraqi
                            reserves of pressing importance, these arrangements remove for some
                            years much of the urgency for the Western companies to purchase larger
                            quantities of Iraqi oil.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d330-12" facs="d330-12"/>
                        <p>34. The Baath leaders apparently recognize that their position has
                            weaknesses, and do not feel great confidence in their ability to
                            dispense entirely with the international oil companies. The Baghdad
                            regime seems inclined to settle for participation in the operations of
                            the Basra and Mosul companies on something like the formula generally
                            accepted by other Persian Gulf producers. For reasons of prestige, the
                            Baath regime will not renounce nationalization of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. But there are signs that the party
                            would be amenable to some settlement in effect providing similar
                            benefits to <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. This would be a tricky
                            business and the terms would have to be sufficiently obfuscated to
                            permit Baghdad to claim victory. It would also require considerable
                            cooperation by the companies.</p>
                        <p>35. A formal settlement which in the case of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> allowed the companies a level of profitability similar
                            to that from handling Persian Gulf crude would represent the optimum
                            solution for all parties and would be a tribute to their devotion to
                            economic interest over principle. If this effort failed, a freezing of
                            the dispute at its present stage would be likely. Both Baghdad and the
                            companies would probably prefer a tacit arrangement on something like
                            present terms-i.e., with <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> in fact
                            acting for its <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> partners-to a formal
                            settlement that appeared to be an undesirable precedent for the future.
                            For a few years at least neither Iraqi need for money nor the oil
                            companies' need for crude will be so extreme as to force either side
                            into what it considers a bad bargain.</p>
                        <p>V. IRAQ AND THE GREAT POWERS</p>
                        <p>36. The Baath regime wants to maintain its independence of both the
                            Soviet Union and the West. But because of experience with European
                            mandates, suspicion of the role of Western governments in oil matters,
                            and abiding antipathy for all whom they see as Israel's supporters, the
                            Baghdad leaders regard the West in general and the US in particular as
                            malevolent imperialists, whereas they are more confident of the friendly
                            intent of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This attitude has
                            been shared by all governments since the revolution, but the tone has
                            varied from the somewhat more cordial approach to the West by Abd
                            al-Rahman Arif before the 1967 war to the present deep suspicion by the
                            Baath Party. The present regime also appears to wish a notably closer
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than some of
                            its immediate predecessors had thought desirable.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>37. The Soviets have had a long-time interest in Iraq and the Persian
                            Gulf area. But the initiative for the 1972 treaty seems to have been
                            taken by the Iraqis. The Baghdad leadership evidently reckoned that it
                            would enhance the regime's domestic prestige and its reputation in the
                            Arab world-at least among the radical Arabs. Moreover, the Baath must
                            have hoped that a treaty might lead to an increase in Soviet military
                            and economic aid, and assistance in increasing Iraqi production and
                            marketing of oil. Equally, the Iraqis probably calculated that the
                            conclusion of an accord might transform the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s benevolent neutrality in the simmering Iraq-Iran
                            dispute into a much more benevolent and less neutral stand. The treaty
                            was concluded in April and ratifications were exchanged in Moscow by
                            Foreign Minister al Bald on 20 July 1972 in the midst of Sadat's
                            expulsion of Soviet military advisors from Egypt. Baghdad has
                            subsequently applied to the Soviet trading bloc, CEMA, for observer
                            status.</p>
                        <p>38. The Soviets have a considerable investment in Iraq. Economic
                            assistance has amounted to over half a billion dollars and military
                            assistance more than a billion since 1956. This makes Iraq the recipient
                            of more <pb n="13" xml:id="d330-13" facs="d330-13"/>aid than any other
                            country in the region except Egypt. Most Iraqi military equipment is of
                            Soviet origin, and Iraq is heavily dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for spare parts, replacements and
                            military expertise. Yet the Soviets find relations with Iraq a thorny
                            issue. Having signed friendship treaties with Egypt and India, Moscow
                            could scarcely turn down Iraq without risk of damage to its
                            relationship. Besides, the Soviets were attracted by the chance to
                            formalize their dealings with one more Arab state. Now that Soviet
                            forces have been ousted from Egypt, the psychological benefit from
                            formal ties with Iraq has become higher. But an Iraqi treaty irritates
                            Iran with whom Moscow has been bent on improving relations over the past
                            decade. Indeed, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> appears to
                            value highly the growing network of economic deals growing out of the
                            agreement to purchase sizable quantities of Iranian natural gas. No
                            doubt also the Kremlin recognizes that Iran is likely to play a far more
                            important role in the region than is Iraq.</p>
                        <p>39. The Iraqi treaty had little effect on Soviet-Arab relations as a
                            whole. Not only did Sadat soon break the spirit if not the letter of
                            Egypt's treaty by expelling Soviet forces, but other radical Arab
                            regimes expressed dissatisfaction with the Iraqi treaty itself. Libya
                            even withdrew its Ambassador from Baghdad for a time in protest. The
                            Asad government in Syria clearly feels no obligation to emulate Iraq in
                            making a formal arrangement with Moscow.</p>
                        <p>40. Within Iraq, Soviet military arrangements are not a significant
                            source of irritation. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            about 400 military personnel in Iraq, serving mostly as advisors. They
                            have not been as obtrusive as were those in Egypt. Soviet naval vessels
                            operating in the Indian Ocean frequently call at the port of Umm Qasr
                            for provisions, supplies, and to show the flag. There have even been
                            some joint exercises with the small Iraqi Navy, but these activities
                            have been intermittent and small scale. Particularly in view of the risk
                            of damaging their relations with Iran, the Soviets do not seem to be
                            pressing for the development of major facilities in Iraq. While Moscow
                            in time may seek more extensive use of Iraqi ports, overflight rights,
                            and possibly use of Iraqi airfields for staging, it will probably move
                            very gradually in this direction and will be prepared to draw back if
                            either the Iraqi price is too high or the Iranian protests are too
                            loud.</p>
                        <p>41. Soviet-Iraqi relations will probably remain close for some years to
                            come. The Baath Party is not searching for spectacular gestures to
                            enhance its prestige and seems unlikely to twist the Kremlin's tail by
                            sending home Soviet advisors as Sadat has done. Even if the Baghdad
                            regime were to decide to improve relations with the West in general and
                            with the US in particular, it would not do so at the expense of its
                            links with Moscow which provide much economic and political benefit. For
                            their part, the Soviets have no reason to wish to disturb the
                            relationship. They will no doubt maintain their present support to the
                            Baghdad government. The Soviet military aid program will continue,
                            though Moscow will be very conscious of its effect on the Shah.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The United States</p>
                        <p>42. The Baath government sees no particular benefit in significantly
                            improving relations with the US. American "imperialism”, particularly in
                            terms of US support for Israel and the activities of the US oil
                            companies, remains the regime's favorite whipping boy and scapegoat.
                            When Iraq broke diplomatic relations with the US after the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict in 1967, it agreed to permit interests sections in Baghdad and
                            Washington. Iraq kept personnel assigned to the Indian embassy in
                            Washington, but the US did not send American personnel to Baghdad <pb n="14" xml:id="d330-14" facs="d330-14"/>until September 1972. This
                            move did relieve some practical difficulties and could be carried out
                            without fanfare. It does not, however, presage further progress toward
                            restoring diplomatic ties. Indeed, the Baath regime would be likely to
                            remain far behind other "progressive" Arab governments in dealing with
                            the US. For example, if Sadat were to restore diplomatic relations with
                            the US, Baghdad might well denounce Egyptian action. It would almost
                            certainly feel little compulsion to follow suit.</p>
                        <p>43. There is not much chance of early change in this prognosis. Factional
                            and personal rivalries within the Baath Party, however they come out, do
                            not revolve around relations with the US. Any Baath regime would be
                            likely to continue the policy of reserve toward restoring diplomatic
                            ties. Even a non-Baath government would not be likely to move rapidly to
                            repair relations with the US. Suspicion of Washington runs deep in Iraq,
                            and there is no internal faction which seems willing to risk running
                            against this tide.</p>
