                    <hi rend="strong">Re-examining Sino-American Relations</hi>
                </p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> came into office
                    determined to improve relations with Communist China. Within days of his
                    inauguration, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> ordered that “every
                    encouragement” be given to speculation that the United States sought
                    rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Through <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> issued National Security Study Memorandum (<gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>) 14, U.S. China Policy, on February 5, 1969.
                    (3, 4,) Although these documents indicate that the original impetus for
                    re-examining policy toward the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> came from
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s enthusiasm for a major initiative toward China grew
                    rapidly. The written responses to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 14 (12,
                    23) as well as meetings of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>'s Senior
                    Review Group (<gloss target="#t_SRG1">SRG</gloss>) outlined the general approach
                    of U.S. policy. (13) Although the written response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 14, prepared primarily by the Department of State, included
                    three options—“Present Strategy, Intensified Deterrence and Isolation, or
                    Reduction of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s Isolation and Points of
                        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>
                    Conflict”—discussions tended to focus on how the United States could reduce
                    tensions, and whether the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would be receptive
                    to any initiative.</p>
                <p>China policy was closely held and the full <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    only met once to discuss this topic. No decisions were reached at the August 14,
                    1969, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting in San Clemente, California,
                    but <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s handwritten notes of a
                    briefing by Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard
                        Helms</persName> provide insight into the President's understanding of the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. (25) Complicating these multiagency
                    discussions was the fact that no one outside of the White House knew of
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s strong desire to communicate
                    directly with the Chinese leadership through secret channels. While the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings and reports were of limited
                    importance, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff itself was vital. This
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume highlights the role of
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff members, particularly <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">John H. Holdridge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston Lord</persName>, who assisted <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in his attempt to shape and implement
                    U.S. policy toward China. (38)</p>
                <p>Another broad study of China policy was undertaken in November 1970 as <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 106 (97). Agency responses and ensuing debate
                    did little to shape the direction of policy toward the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, but did signal to the bureaucracy that major changes were
                    under consideration. (105, 108) One of the most contentious issues was whether
                    to reduce the U.S. military presence on Taiwan. While the Department of State
                    and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> advocated removing some of these
                    forces as the war in Southeast Asia came to an end, the Department of Defense
                    submitted a paper to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> stating a variety
                    of concerns over any modification to U.S. presence on the island. (110) In April
                    1971, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> requested <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 124, “Next Steps toward the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>,” the response to which laid out further steps
                    to be taken to spur rapprochement. (117, 129) These studies, primarily prepared
                    in the Department of State, raised few new ideas, but did serve as “laundry
                    lists” of measures from which <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    selected over the next few months. Until July 1971, the Departments of State,
                    Defense, and Commerce, along with the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
                    participated in these discussions, without knowledge of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> initiative to seek direct contact with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Signaling a Thaw</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>s 14, 106, and 124 included recommendations
                    on trade and travel policies, which became one way for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to signal his desire to improve relations
                    with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. This effort began with National
                    Security Decision Memorandum (<gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>) 17 of June
                    26, 1969, “Relaxation of Economic Controls against China.” (14) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, through <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, requested that the Under Secretaries Committee,
                    headed by Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot
                        Richardson</persName>, devise plans to implement these changes. (17)
                        <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, the Department of State
                    official most trusted by the White House, suggested other small steps to relax
                    trade and travel regulations. (19) During the first year of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> presidency, the Department of State,
                    often through <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, had its
                    greatest influence over China policy, primarily by resurrecting a variety of
                    measures related to trade and travel with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> rejected during the final year of the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> administration. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName>, the Assistant Secretary of State
                    for East Asia and the Pacific, was also influential in shaping the Department's
                    policy toward the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. The Department's knowledge of and influence
                    over China policy, however, declined during the 1969 to 1972 period.</p>
                <p>In September 1969, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed with a
                    memorandum signed by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P.
                        Rogers</persName> that passport restrictions on travel with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> be extended for six months, then eliminated.
                    (35) <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> also sent a memorandum to
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, December 2, in which he laid
                    out the “Next Moves in China Policy.” He recommended that <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 17 be implemented completely and suggested
                    further measures related to travel and trade. (49) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> approved these measures, but wanted them implemented in a
                    “low key” manner. In December 1970, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> requested further steps that could be taken in this
                    area, and in January 1971, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> approved
                    another series of trade liberalization measures. (101, 111) Immediately after
                    the announcement of “ping-pong diplomacy” in April 1971, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> requested another set of trade and travel
                    modifications in <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 105. (116) By early June
                    1971, the Under Secretaries Committee had provided Nixon with a full range of
                    restrictions that could be modified.</p>
                <p>Sino-American meetings in Warsaw, scheduled for February 1969, represented the
                    second avenue to improve relations. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> approved the Department of
                    State's draft instructions to <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Walter
                        Stoessel</persName>, the Ambassador to Poland, indicating that the United
                    States was eager for “serious negotiations.” (6) The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, however, cancelled the meeting, ostensibly due to the
                    defection of one of their diplomats. In his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the Ambassador to Poland,
                        <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Walter Stoessel</persName>, on September 9,
                    1969, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated his eagerness to
                    resume the Warsaw Talks. (31) <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>
                    arranged two meetings with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> representatives
                    in Warsaw, on January 20 and February 20, 1970. (61, 62, 67, 68) Prior to the
                    January meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted
                    optimistically that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had assumed a “more
                    pragmatic style of diplomacy.” (59) The February 20 meeting marked a major
                    turning point, as the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> issued an invitation
                    for the United States to dispatch an envoy to Beijing for talks. (69) <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and the Department of State advocated a
                    slow and cautious approach, while <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    sought a more aggressive policy of high-level meetings with no preconditions.
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s rejection of the Department
                    of State's plan marked the end of the Department's substantive role in
                    formulating China policy during the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> anger
                    over the U.S. invasion of Cambodia led to the cancellation of the Warsaw
                    meetings scheduled for the late spring of 1970. (80) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> did
                    not wish to revive the Warsaw Talks, and instead sought to open communication
                    through Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also removed military irritants to U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> relations. In early 1969, they limited aerial
                    reconnaissance of the mainland, particularly U-2 overflights. (10) Following a
                    small raid by <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> forces on the mainland, the
                    Department of State also worked to gain assurances from <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and his son, <persName corresp="#p_JJC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, to provide the United States
                    prior notice and veto power for any future military action on the mainland. (16)
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also ordered the end of the
                    Taiwan Strait patrol in September 1969, despite vigorous protests from the
                        <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>. (34, 50) In late November 1969,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> approved a Department of
                    State plan to impress upon <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials the
                    significance of the patrol's cancellation. (48)</p>

                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> perceived Sino-Soviet tensions and
                    the possibility of a military conflict between the two Communist giants as both
                    a danger and an opportunity. In <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 63, “U.S.
                    Policy on Current Sino-Soviet Differences,” the administration began to study
                    the conflict in a comprehensive fashion. (15, 40, 41, 46) The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>'s Washington Special Actions Group (<gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>) and the Senior Review Group (<gloss target="#t_SRG1">SRG</gloss>) met in the summer and early autumn of 1969 to
                    discuss <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 63 and a separate report devoted
                    to “Immediate U.S. Policy Problems in Event of Major Sino-Soviet Hostilities.”
                    (29, 32, 36, 43, 47) This report, prepared for the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>, stated that the United States would “publicly emphasize its
                    impartiality and noninvolvement, urge both sides not to use nuclear weapons,
                    call for negotiations and the restoration of peace, and take steps to avoid any
                    provocative actions or accidental contact by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                    forces with belligerent forces.” (43)</p>
                <p>Taken as a whole, the documents suggest that this was less a crisis than some may
                    have believed, as there were few in the U.S. Government who expected a major
                    Sino-Soviet conflict despite heated rhetoric by each side. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, however, that the United States needed to make
                    clear that it would not support any Soviet attack on China. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was concerned that a weak U.S.
                    response to Soviet probes could increase the risk of war, and that “the Soviets
                    may be using us to generate an impression in China and the world that we are
                    being consulted in secret.” (37) By early 1971, the United States was actually
                    attempting to exaggerate the Soviet threat to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in order to encourage rapprochement with Washington.</p>
                <p>Even prior to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s July 1971 trip,
                    the United States began to inform the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    secretly of developments in Soviet-U.S. relations, particularly issues related
                    to arms control talks. (126) The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the
                    United States frequently exchanged information on their policies toward the
                    Soviet Union. As <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wrote to
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> after an August 1971 meeting
                    with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> representatives in New York: “We are
                    building a solid record of keeping the Chinese informed on all significant
                    subjects of concern to them, which gives them an additional stake in nurturing
                    our new relationship.” (155) Throughout 1971 and 1972, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> relayed messages through Paris or New
                    York to the Chinese, detailing Soviet-American discussions. For example, both
                    sides exchanged information on their responses to the Soviet's proposal for
                    five-power nuclear talks. (155) On October 2, <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> informed <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> diplomats
                    in Paris that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would provide
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> “a full rundown” of discussions
                    with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei

                    In late July 1972 <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> discussed

                <p>While relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> experienced no
                    fundamental change from early 1969 through mid-1971, there appeared a series of

                    the United States the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. The Departments of

                        <persName>Chiang</persName> and his son, Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_JJC1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, attempted to connect military
                    reorganization to the transfer of sophisticated military equipment, such as F-4
                    fighters. (1, 8, 86) During the summer of 1969, word of possible modifications
                    to trade and travel restrictions to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    leaked out, and <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> attempted to reassure <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> leaders that “there had been no change in basic
                        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward Communist China.” (21, 22)
                    Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName>, Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">Walter

                    the Taiwan Strait patrol. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also
                    met with the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> Ambassador to the United
                    States, <persName corresp="#p_ZS1">Chow Shu-kai</persName>. (44, 45, 52)
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> expressed concerns about the Warsaw Talks in
                    early 1970, but was assured by <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that
                    of the meetings with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials would not
                    affect the U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan and the Pescadores. (71, 74) In
                    early 1970, a new problem arose, as the U.S. Government grudgingly accepted the
                    admission of Taiwanese dissident Peng Ming-min to the United States. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed with the Department of State
                    that there existed no legal reason to exclude Peng, despite angry accusations
                    from <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> officials that the United States was
                    supporting the Taiwanese independence movement. (65, 91, 92)</p>
                <p>The most important visitor from the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> to the

                        <persName>Chiang</persName> raised concerns over the Warsaw Talks, and
                    worried that U.S. attention was diverted to Southeast Asia to the detriment of
                        <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> security. (76)
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> spoke with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Melvin R. Laird</persName> about the need for advanced weapons and an
                    explicit commitment of U.S. support. (77, 78)</p>
                <p>By early 1971, general <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> concerns over the
                    possibility of U.S. rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    and specific conflicts in bilateral relations increased tensions. One issue was
                    the reversion of Okinawa to Japan and the final disposition of the Senkaku
                    (Taioyutai in Chinese) Islands, which are located roughly between Okinawa and
                    Taiwan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ZS1">Chow Shu-kai</persName> urged
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to state publicly that any Japanese-American treaty
                    would not prejudice <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> claims to these small
                    islands. (113, 114, 115) In June, the United States and the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> engaged in heated negotiations over textiles
                    exports to the United States. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">David
                        Kennedy</persName> and others from the Department of State and Commerce
                    carried out the talks, which were a small side-show to the larger problem of
                    Japanese-American economic relations. The <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>
                    connected the textile issue, the Senkaku Islands, and the need for advanced

                        Ching-kuo</persName> did obtain a promise that the Department of State would

                    were transmitted through ambassadors in Beijing or private individuals, some of
                    whom were personal acquaintances of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. During his August 1969 around-the-world trip,
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> informed the leaders of Romania
                    and Pakistan of his interest in improved relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. (20) In the late summer and fall of that year,
                    Pakistani President <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">Yahya Khan</persName> offered
                    to play an active role in rapprochement. In the Pakistani channel <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had found a secret avenue for communication that
                    by-passed the Department of State. (26, 28, 39). In December, the Pakistani
                    Ambassador to the United States, <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Agha
                        Hilaly</persName>, transmitted the first direct message from the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>
                    reported that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> leaders had released two
                    detained Americans and were willing to resume the Warsaw Talks without
                    preconditions, and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that
                    the United States was interested in improving relations. (54, 55) In concert
                    with the invitation to the United States relayed in the February 20, 1970,
                    Warsaw Talks meeting, direct contact appeared likely when <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> reported that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> leaders “no longer see the Vietnam War as a problem between us”
                    and that they did not fear a Soviet-U.S. condominium against them. The Chinese
                    suggested that they were interested in “meaningful dialogue.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> to relay a message to Yahya, who could then inform the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> diplomats in Rawalpindi that the United
                    States was “prepared to open a direct White House channel” to Beijing. (70) The
                    U.S. invasion of Cambodia, however, put talks in hold until late 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> moved to rejuvenate contacts at his
                    October 1970 meeting with Yahya in Washington, where he offered to send a secret
                    envoy to Beijing. (94) <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> relayed
                    Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s response to
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on December 9, which
                    concluded that “a special envoy of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s would be most welcome in Peking.” Seven days later,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> that the United States sought talks on a
                    wide range of topics. (99) During the first four months of 1971, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> signaled a willingness to improve relations
                    through <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s interview with Edgar Snow
                    (103), Norwegian diplomats in Beijing (104), and the famous invitation to the
                    American ping-pong team. (112) On April 27, 1971, <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> relayed a message from <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, inviting <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, or <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> for a public visit to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. The note also stated that arrangements could

                <p>Pakistan's role in Sino-American rapprochement could not be divorced from its
                    conflict with India. The stability of Pakistan was a key area of cooperation
                    between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> after
                    mid-1971 prompting a remarkable measure of diplomatic coordination. In <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s meetings with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> diplomats in New York during November and
                    December 1971, both sides exchanged positions and messages concerning the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the antagonists on the subcontinent, India
                    and Pakistan. (173, 175, 176) South Asia was also one of the important
                    substantive issues discussed by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s deputy, <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Alexander M.

                <p>This volume provides the first complete collection of memoranda of conversation
                    from <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s July 9-11 trip to the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, including discussions of the history of
                    Sino-U.S. relations, personalities and policies of world leaders, planning for
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, U.S. military forces on Taiwan, the prospects
                    for conflict on the Korean Peninsula, U.S. relations with Japan, arms talks with
                    the Soviet Union, the war in Southeast Asia, and arrangements for further
                    contacts through Paris. In an important meeting, July 1, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> laid out the general approach he wished
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to take during these talks,
                    emphasizing that the United States should not “indicate a willingness to abandon
                    much of our support for Taiwan until it was necessary to do so.” (137) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also wanted <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to highlight three areas of concern to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>: 1) the U.S. reaction to a stalemate in
                    Vietnam, 2) the danger of a resurgent Japan, and 3) the threat posed by the
                    Soviet military. Markings on the original texts indicate that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> himself reviewed these memoranda, some of
                    which are over 40 pages long. Several key themes emerged from the talks. The
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> urged the United States to remove its
                    forces from Southeast Asia, but stated that it had no intention of becoming
                    involved, militarily or diplomatically, in the conflict. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was also forceful on the issue of Taiwan,
                    and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> tied the U.S. presence on
                    the island to the war in Southeast Asia. (139, 140, 141, 142, 143) One can see
                    the outlines of the Shanghai Communiqué beginning to take shape over six months
                    prior to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit.</p>
                <p>Scholars will find the memorandum prepared after each visit as interesting as the
                    records of the meetings themselves. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> provided <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    an overview of his talks with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>,
                    calling them “the most searching, sweeping and significant discussions I have
                    ever had in government.” (144) Other documents reveal much about <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s personality and his concerns over how
                    the China initiative was perceived in the United States The President requested
                    that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> tell the press “how RN is
                    uniquely prepared for this meeting and how ironically in many ways he has
                    similar character characteristics and background to <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then listed
                    nine similarities between himself and the Premier. (147) This volume also
                    highlights the secrecy that surrounded <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s foreign policy. For example, in August 1971, Secretary
                    of Defense, <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Melvin Laird</persName>, wrote to
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to request more information
                    on China policy, as well as an opportunity to participate in deliberations. He
                    was politely rebuffed by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.
                    (154)</p>
                <p>In Paris, Defense Attaché <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Vernon Walters</persName>
                    began a series of clandestine meetings with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    ambassador to France, <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName>.
                        <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> served as an important
                    conduit for messages between the two countries for organizing visits to the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and larger issues in Sino-American
                    relations. (149, 150) By the end of July, 1971, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName>
                    had met secretly in Paris to plan the October visit. (151) The volume contains
                    one lengthy segment of the memoranda of conversation from <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s talks with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, and includes three memoranda reporting to
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> the content and atmosphere of
                    the October meetings in Beijing. (162, 163, 164, 165) Printed as an attachment
                    to one of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s memoranda is an
                    early draft of what would become the Shanghai Communiqué. (165) This Foreign
                    Relations volume also reveals much about the relationship among <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. In
                    a series of messages sent to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    while he was in Beijing, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> requested
                    private meetings with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>, something that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> showed little enthusiasm for.
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also found himself caught
                    up in disputes over the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote on the expulsion
                    of the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> and seating of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, which occurred as he was returning from China.
                    He blamed <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and the Department of
                    State for mishandling the vote. (161) The U.S. eagerness to prove its
                    credibility to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> can be seen in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, “Concrete Commitments to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Made During <gloss target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss>
                    October 1971 Visit.” (166) Many of these commitments involved the United States
                    relations with the Soviet Union, Japan, and the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>, as well as a promise to investigate protests in support of
                    Taiwan independence and report the results to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. The record indicates that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> told the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    relatively little, stating that nothing could be done about these
                    demonstrations. (173) The electronic supplement contains materials documenting
                        <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>' activities, all memorandum
                    of conversation from <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s October
                    trip (including counter-part talks to prepare for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s February trip), complete versions of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s summaries for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, and the drafts of the communiqué.</p>

                </p>
                <p>One of the most interesting transcripts prepared for this volume from the White
                    House tapes covers a long conversation between <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on
                    the eve of the February trip to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. (192)
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that the Chinese
                    are “just as dangerous [as the Russians]. In fact they're more dangerous over an
                    historical period.” This fascinating discussion touched upon almost all aspects
                    of Sino-American relations and the U.S. role in East Asia. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made clear his concerns over appearing to
                    abandon the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> or reduce its presence in East
                    Asia. He also bluntly elucidated his view of the limited role played by
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and the Department of State in
                    forging U.S. foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    also prepared a memorandum for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    entitled “<persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and the Chinese Litmus Test,” where he urged <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to show “seriousness and reliability” in
                    talks with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> leaders. (193) The record of
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s talks in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> begins with his famous meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> on February 21, 1972, and includes seven other meetings
                    with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> between February 21 and 28.
                    (194-204) Also printed here is one of the memoranda of conversation from
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' meeting with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> (198), and one of the final discussions
                    between <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Vice Minister of
                    Foreign Affairs, Ch'iao Kuan-hua Chou concerning the Shanghai communiqué. (202)
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> continued the effort begun
                    during <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s earlier visits to tie
                    the war in Southeast Asia to the U.S. presence on Taiwan, reiterated the promise
                    made by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that two-thirds of the
                    U.S. forces on the island were related to the war, and could be removed after
                    “as the situation in Southeast Asia is resolved.” At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was concerned over the domestic political
                    impact of the communiqué. He told <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                    that “What we say here may make it impossible for me to deliver on what I can
                    do.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> claimed that three groups
                    wanted his trip to China to fail: those on the left because they wanted better
                    relations with the Soviets; those on the right for “deeply principled
                    ideological reasons” wanted to support the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>;
                    and supporters of India who feared Sino-American détente. (196) During these
                    talks, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> covered much of the same
                    ground with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as he did with
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in October and July of
                    1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                    touched upon almost every conceivable issue in international affairs, including
                    most importantly the Soviet Union and its strategic weapons program. (196) They
                    also discussed the history of Sino-American relations, each providing their own
                    interpretation of U.S. policy under President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his
                    Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. (196) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                    approval, provided the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> with detailed
                    information on Soviet military deployments. (202) On several occasions he
                    emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> should not have signed
                    the 1954 Geneva Agreements, characterizing this as a “mistake.” Taiwan appeared
                    to be the most controversial issue. However, as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> stated on the final day of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s trip, ”That is, we being so big, have already let the
                    Taiwan issue remain for 22 years, and can still afford to let it wait there for
                    a time. Although the issue of Taiwan is an obstacle to the normalization of our
                    relations, yet we are not rushing to make use of the opponents of your present
                    visit and attempt to solve all the questions and place you in an embarrassing
                    position.” (204) One of the most interesting documents is a rare memorandum from
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>, and
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> emphasizing the need to
                    avoid public speculation over the impact of the trip to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, and ”there should be no further elaboration”
                    on the communiqué, particularly those sections related to Taiwan. (206) Shortly
                    after, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wrote a memorandum for
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, comparing statements after
                    the February trip to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visits to
                    the Soviet Union as Vice President. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    wanted to emphasize that he had been ”whenever possible conciliatory” without
                    compromising principle. (210) The electronic supplement will contain the
                    memorandum of conversation between <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and top <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials,
                    as well as <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' meetings while in

                <p>Immediately after <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s July 16, 1971,
                    announcement of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s trip to the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, efforts began to calm the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> and to reduce the domestic political fall-out
                    from supporters of the Nationalist government. The Department of State bore the
                    brunt of <persName>Chiang</persName>'s wrath, both in Washington and Taipei.
                    (145, 146) In fact, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had met with
                    the Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>
                    <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">Walter McConaughy</persName> in late June, and had
                    hinted at further improvements in relations between the United States and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    told <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> to inform
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> that the United States could continue its
                    ”close, friendly” relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>. On
                    July 27, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> met with <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> Ambassador to the United States <persName corresp="#p_SJCH1">James Shen</persName> to offer assurances of continued
                    support. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that ”nothing
                    in his tenure in the White House had been more painful to him than what had
                    occurred (the secrecy over Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s trip to Peking and the announcement of the President's
                    visit).” (152) In his meetings with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SJCH1">Shen</persName> had
                    little success at obtaining information on U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> talks. (159)</p>

                    most non-Communist capitals in East and Southeast Asia immediately after the

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on March 23, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reviewed reactions to the China trip.
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> emphasized that ”<persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> should also play down the Taiwan aspect as
                    much as possible.” (215) After their return from Beijing, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_SJCH1">Shen</persName> to assure the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> of
                    continued support. (205) On March 6, <persName corresp="#p_SJCH1">Shen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met
                    briefly, a conversation for which the only record located is a White House tape,
                    which is transcribed here. (207)</p>
                <p>In meetings with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> during the
                    summer of 1972, <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> diplomats urged <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to pressure the Japanese to delay any
                    improvement in relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said little more than that he hoped
                    Japan would not ”become separated from the United States on this question.”
                    (241) In talks with Shen in September, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that ”What the Japanese wanted was for the
                    U.S. to defend Taiwan, which we were happy enough to do, so that they themselves
                    would be left alone with Peking.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he told the Japanese that they were moving
                    too quickly toward normalization with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.
                    (251) On the same day, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> told
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> that ”Our position—on which
                    you can rely—is that we will place no obstacle in the way of normalization of
                    relations between Japan and the People's Republic. We have not asked them [the
                    Japanese] to delay their visit or the conclusions they want to draw from their
                    visit.” (252)</p>
                <p>Ironically, in 1972 the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> acquired some
                    advanced U.S. weapons, including submarines. (255) These weapons were offered
                    even as the United States began to reduce joint intelligence operations on
                    Taiwan. (257) As the prospects for a cease-fire improved, a secret program
                    entitled Enhance Plus was undertaken to resupply the South Vietnamese military
                    with weapons and ammunition from U.S. allies. (256) This gave the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> bargaining leverage to demand the temporary
                    basing of F-4 fighter aircraft on the island, sale of F-5 aircraft to the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>, and a co-production program for the F-5
                    fighter on Taiwan. (264, 268) The year 1972 ended with a Special National
                    Intelligence Estimate 43-1-72 concluding that the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> might be able to fabricate a nuclear device as early at 1976.

                <p>Immediately after the February 1972 trip to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (with

                    contacts with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. This began with <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 148, which requested information on how to
                    expand exchanges between the United States and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 149 on bilateral
                    trade. (209, 211) Summaries of these reports and discussions in the <gloss target="#t_SRG1">SRG</gloss> produced a list of steps to be taken under
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s direction. These documents
                    also illustrate how the debate had shifted after July 1971—there was no longer
                    dissent over whether to increase communication, but rather how to achieve a
                    wider ranger of contacts. (217, 218) These discussions bore fruit in <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 170, June 8, 1972, which outlined further
                    steps to be taken to expand trade, and <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>

                    assets in the United States (228, 249) While the Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat
                    have received a great deal of attention from scholars, a memorandum from
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, September 1972, outlines the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s attempt to buy American grain through a
                    French company. (250) In March 1972, U.S. Ambassador to France, <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Arthur K. Watson</persName>, began to meet on a regular
                    basis with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> diplomats in Paris. This channel
                    was reserved for less sensitive topics, such as educational exchanges and trade
                    issues. (242) <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> appeared to send
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> slightly fuller records of

                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> made ending the war in Southeast Asia on favorable
                    terms a key goal of Sino-American rapprochement. As detailed elsewhere in this
                    summary, the war was a frequent topic in <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s discussions with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and other Chinese leaders. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> summed up his perception in October 1971, when he
                    informed <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that ”Peking will be
                    helpful, within limits.” (164) In January and February of 1972, Walters was the
                    conduit for a series of messages designed to obtain <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> assistance with negotiations, including a request that the
                    Chinese arrange a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName>.
                    (188-191) Vietnam was an important topic at the February 1972 meetings in
                    Beijing. Yet, the war in Southeast Asia became a major problem in Sino-American
                    relations, as U.S. bombing near the Chinese border led to strong protests during
                    the spring and summer of 1972. (213) This volume presents several of the notes
                    or statements from <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> diplomats in New York, apologizing for some of
                    these incidents. (233) The electronic supplement provides further documentation
                    on these exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> sought to obtain <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> support for his proposals to the North
                    Vietnamese for a cease-fire. He often referenced the danger of U.S.
                    ”embarrassment” or that ”any attempt to impose a military solution upon the
                    United States can only lead to unfortunate consequences.” (219) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> repeatedly informed <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> in New York that the United States
                    would not accept military defeat, but did not seek military victory either.
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> updated <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> diplomats on progress in the Paris Peace Talks,
                    including the specific negotiating positions of each side. (220)</p>
                <p>The volume contains <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s personal
                    letter to <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, May 8, explaining
                    the logic behind the May 8 decision to mine North Vietnam's harbors. The
                    President stressed that this action was not directed against other nations and
                    was designed to bring the conflict to an end. (226) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s reported that <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName>'s reaction was
                    ”restrained” and that this suggested a ”moderate Chinese response” to U.S.
                    bombing and mining operations. (227) The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was
                    careful to avoid any commitment to assist the United States in communication,
                    much less lobbying, the North Vietnamese. In one chilling exchange, the United
                    States requested that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> intervene to
                    prevent the possible execution of U.S. prisoners held by the North Vietnamese.
                    The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> response was that the ”Chinese position
                    in such affairs is total non-interference.” (238, fn. 2)</p>
                <p>The June 1972 visit by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was marked by further discussions of
                    issues such as South Asia, Japan, and the Soviet Union, with growing attention
                    paid to U.S. efforts to obtain <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> support for
                    its plan to end the war in Southeast Asia. In their final meeting on June 22,
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> states that ”there have been not
                    too many constructive exchanges” in the June talks. (231, 232, 233) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s summary of the talks prepared for
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was decidedly optimistic. (234)
                    Through the latter half of 1972, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> provided the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    diplomats with U.S. position statements and proposals for the Paris Talks with
                    the North Vietnamese. (253) In a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                        Hua</persName>, October 24 <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    asked ”whether the Prime Minister [<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                        En-lai</persName>] might be willing to use his good offices in the rather
                    complicated state that our negotiations have reached with the Vietnamese.” He
                    continued to ask that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ”convince Hanoi
                    that this [U.S. cease-fire proposal] is not a trick.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> admitted that obtaining South
                    Vietnamese agreement had become the sticking point. (258) The next day, the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> forwarded a message through New York,
                    focusing blame on South Vietnam and the United States for the continuing
                    conflict. (259) The United States responded by providing a copy of the offer
                    made to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and requesting that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ”use its considerable influence in a positive
                    direction so as to help bring about the peace that now is so near.” (260) Both
                    sides traded messages, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> pointing out that
                    the United States had backtracked in its talks after failing to obtain South
                    Vietnamese agreement, the United States asking for <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> support for its revised peace proposals. (261, 272) The year
                    concluded with another flurry of messages, as <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> or <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff traveled
                    to New York to warn of military action if the North Vietnamese did not accept a
                    cease fire, then to explain the Christmas bombing, and finally to inform the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> of U.S. willingness to resume talks.
                    (269, 270) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s effort to have the
                    Chinese influence the North Vietnamese had little effect.</p>

                <p>U.S. policy toward the Mongolian People's Republic experienced no significant
                    change during these four years. In 1969, the Department of State suggested, and
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, that the United
                    States should move toward establishing diplomatic relations with Mongolia.
                    Strong objections by <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>,
                    however, caused <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to reject any
                    initiatives toward Mongolia. Although the Department State continued to raise
                    the issue, no action was taken during the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. (271, 272)</p>

                <p>Sino-American rapprochement determined U.S. policy toward Tibet. Support of the

                    Tibetan guerillas formed the twin pillars of U.S. policy, which had little
                    knowledge of, much less influence in, Tibet itself. Although the Department of
                    State was generally supportive of limited visits by the Dalai Lama to the United
                    States, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> vetoed such a trip
                    throughout the 1969-1972 period. (275, 276, 277, 279) Covert support for the
                    Dalai Lama and his followers continued, although the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and other government agencies reduced this assistance by the
                    early 1970s. (278) The Central Intelligence Agency provided financial and
                    logistical support for a large number of Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India.
                    These guerillas were primarily to provide intelligence on <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> activities in Tibet. Over the course of the
                    first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposed, and the White House accepted, a plan
                    to phase out for these largely ineffectual paramilitary operations. (278,

                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing
                    a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> subseries that documents the most important decisions and
                    actions of the foreign policy of the administration of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>. This is the sixth <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in a new format,
                    that of electronic-only publication. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes
                    scheduled for publication for the 1969–1976 subseries, covering the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations, will be in this format. The decision to
                    institute this change was taken in full consultation with the Department's
                    Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established
                    under the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute. The advantages of
                    this new method of presenting documentation are evident in this volume: the
                    format provides convenient access to important supplemental documentation on key
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy shift, all or any portion of which can be easily
                    downloaded. Annotation—the value added element of documentary editing—is still
                    present in limited form, but not on the scale of a Foreign Relations print
                    volume. This electronic-only publication results in substantial savings in cost
                    and time of production, thus allowing the series to present a fuller range of
                    documentation, on a wider range of topics, sooner than would have been possible
                    under a print-only format. These advantages compensate for the fact that this
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an actual book bound
                    in traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the Historian, the General
                    Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all dedicated to publishing
                    the great majority of the volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also posted in electronic
                    format on the Department of State's website. While the future of research in
                    documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease of use and
                    availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue to use both
                    print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In that
                    sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the series
                    begun by President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward and
                    continued by subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for more than 140
                    years.</p>

                    Relations, 1969–1976, Volume E–13</p>
                <p>This volume supplements the recently released print volume XVII, China,
                    1969–1972, by publishing 175 documents, most of which are cited in the footnotes
                    of print volume XVII, that relate to the high-level contacts between the
                    People's Republic of China and the United States. Typically, the print volume
                    presents the shorter (and sometimes more subjective) summary memorandum of a
                    conversation or important message that National Security Advisor <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName> and the National Security
                    Council staff prepared for the President, while the supplement contains the
                    verbatim memorandum of conversation or the full text of messages exchanged. In
                    addition, Vol. E–13 contains documentation on the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's historic opening to China, including
                    accounts of meetings at the foreign minister level during President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to Beijing in 1972, backchannel
                    messages, and memoranda from other agencies, such as the Department of Defense.
                    This extra coverage of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration's opening to China is the result of a decision to give this
                    historic and important U.S. foreign policy shift maximum coverage in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the date and time of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> electronic-only volumes follows Office style guidelines,
                    supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the
                    Declassification and Publishing Division. The original text is reproduced
                    exactly, including marginalia or other notations, which are both visible on the
                    facsimile copy of the document and described in the source note. There is also a
                    text version of the document. The editors have supplied a heading, a summary,
                    and a source note with additional relevant information, as required, for each
                    document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are
                    retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors
                    are silently corrected in the text file. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the text, and a list of abbreviations, persons, and
                    sources accompanies the volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text
                    file to indicate text omitted by the editors because it deals with an unrelated
                    subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is
                    blacked-out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type)
                    appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld
                    because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source
                    note, and a bracketed note indicating the number of pages not declassified.
                    These denied documents are listed in their chronological place in the
                    volume.</p>

                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (<gloss target="#t_NARA1">NARA</gloss>) has custody of the

                    historical materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations
                    require <gloss target="#t_NARA1">NARA</gloss> to review these materials for

                    of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House officials,
                    since these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal
                    materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and related implementing public
                    access regulations require <gloss target="#t_NARA1">NARA</gloss> to notify

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information, and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The declassification review of
                    this volume, which began in 1999 and was completed in 2002, resulted in the
                    decision to deny no documents in full and to make minor excisions in 6
                    documents. The editors are confident, on the basis of the research conducted in
                    preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that this volume is an accurate supplemental record of the
                    foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration towards China from 1969 to 1972.</p>

                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires

                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the

                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of

                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between

                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department's

                    The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> files contain about 1,300 archive boxes
                    of materials. In particular, the Country Files for the Republic of China on
                    Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (Boxes 518–529); President's
                    File—China Trip (Boxes 846–851); and Files for the President—China Materials
                    (1031–1038) hold the most complete documentation of high-level policy
                    making.</p>
                <p>There are several collections in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files
                    that contain scattered,but often unique, documentation on the evolution of
                    America's China policy, including the chronological files for various <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff members such as <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Alexander M. Haig</persName>, Robert Houdek, <persName corresp="#p_LWA1">Anthony Lake</persName>, Jon Howe, <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Harold Saunders</persName>, and Richard Solomon. Finally,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s Office Files overlap
                    considerably with the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers at
                    the Library of Congress (discussed below). This collection includes materials
                    from the Presidential transition (November 1968–January 1969),overseas trips,
                    and Country Files (Boxes 86–100 cover China).</p>
                <p>Besides the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Materials include the White House Central
                    Files, which have Staff Member and Office Files, subject files and name files.
                    There also exists the White House Special Files,which include Staff Member and
                    Office Files, Subject Files, and Name Files. The White House Central Files
                    generally contain less sensitive materials, but add some insight into the
                    connection between the domestic and foreign policies of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House. The Special Files' Staff
                    Member Office Files collection includes the files of H.R. <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EJD1">John
                        Ehrlichman</persName>, and most other important White House staff members.
                    It also holds the President's Office Files (<gloss target="#t_POF1">POF</gloss>), which have the President's Handwriting File (copies of documents
                    with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>'s
                    handwritten comments) and Memoranda for the President. The Memoranda for the
                    President is a chronological collection of memoranda of conversation or other
                    documentation of meetings attended by <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. It includes meetings related to domestic politics and
                    foreign policy, and often contains records of talks with foreign leaders. While
                    only a small portion of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files have been
                    declassified,much of the Central and Special Files are available to the public.
                    Binders with complete box lists for these materials are available at the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials
                    Project.</p>
                <p>One important resource is the White House Central Files, President's Daily Diary,
                    which lists all those who met with the President at the White House or while he
                    was traveling. The Diary also indicates telephone calls to and from the
                    President and has a daily record of ”Presidential Movements.”</p>
                <p>The White House tapes, which began in February 1971, provide an invaluable record
                    of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> foreign policy and life in the
                    White House. Conversations were recorded from the Oval Office, Cabinet Room,
                    Camp David, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s private office in the
                    Executive Office Building (<gloss target="#t_EOB1">EOB</gloss>), as well as the
                    White House and Camp David telephones. A tape log outlining the topics of each
                    conversation and providing specific conversation numbers, time, date, and names
                    of those on the tape has been prepared by the staff at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project. An
                    abbreviation, acronym, and name list has also been provided by <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Project to help narrow the search of the
                    tapes. The tapes themselves vary greatly in quality; those from the <gloss target="#t_EOB1">EOB</gloss> office are difficult to hear, while those in
                    the Cabinet Room or over the telephone are often quite clear.</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Institutional Files (H–Files) contain documents distributed
                    prior to each <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting (71 meetings held from
                    1969 to 1972), Special Review Group (49 meetings), Senior Review Group (91
                    meetings), Washington Special Actions Group (153 meetings),Defense Program
                    Review Committee (23 meetings), Verification Panel (45 meetings), Vietnam
                    Special Studies Group (7 meetings), and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    Intelligence Committee (1 meeting), along with detailed minutes of most of these
                    meetings. There is a guide to the H–Files available at the National
                    Archives.</p>
                <p>After the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials
                    Project, the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName> Papers
                    located in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress are second in
                    importance. While the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> papers
                    contain copies of many of the most important items found in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project, the chief
                    advantage of these files is that they are well-organized and contain fewer
                    materials on administrative matters of little value to most researchers. The
                    most useful parts of the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers
                    are the Chronological Files, Memoranda of Conversations,Memoranda for the
                    President, and a collection of documents organized by country under the
                    Geopolitical Files heading. The <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    papers also contain records of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s telephone conversations (telcons). The telcons, prepared
                    by members of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff, include Kissinger's
                    talks with President Nixon, Secretaries Rogers and Laird, other top U.S.
                    officials, foreign diplomats (including ”unofficial” go-betweens involved in
                    Japanese textile negations), scholars, and newspaper, magazine, and television
                    reporters (who comprise about one-third of the total number of conversations).
                    Copies of the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> telephone
                    conversations are also available at the National Archives and are open to the
                    public. Another unique item in the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> papers is a typed version of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s daily schedule. This is found under
                    Miscellany, 1968–1976, Record of Schedule, though the schedule before August 31,
                    1970, has not been located. For an overview of the entire collection,
                    researchers are advised to consult ”<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName>: A Register of his Papers in the Library of Congress,”
                    prepared by the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress in 1996.Access to
                    these papers currently requires permission from <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                <p>Since <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> dominated the formulation and
                    implementation of China policy, the files of the Department of State, the
                    Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) are of less importance for the 1969–1972
                    period than for earlier administrations.The White House deliberately excluded
                    these agencies from involvement in rapprochement between the United States and
                    the People's Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>). These
                    files are, however, important sources of information for researching America's
                    increasingly troubled relationship with the Republic of China on Taiwan (<gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>). The Central Files of the Department of State
                    are most valuable for information on day-to-day interaction with the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> and for some information on events within the
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. The Lot Files of the Department of
                    State containing some useful information are the records of the Executive
                    Secretariat (S/S), the organization charged with managing the paperwork of the
                    Secretary of State (Lots 71 D 175 and 72 D 318) and the Conference Files, a
                    consolidated grouping of documents related to trips by the Secretary, the
                    President, and the Vice President. This latter collection includes many
                    memoranda of conversation with foreign leaders and correspondence from
                    high-level American officials while they were on travel or at the United Nations
                    in New York.</p>

                    <p>DATE AND PLACE: Friday, December 19, 1969, in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s Office</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> began by recalling
                        his last call on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> with
                        the Pakistani Minister of Information and National Affairs, Sher Ali, on
                        October 10. He recalled that, at that time, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had indicated that the Pakistanis might inform the
                        Communist Chinese informally of U.S. intentions to pull out two destroyers
                        from the Taiwan Straits.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> explained the passage
                        of time before that message was conveyed. Sher Ali did not leave the U.S.
                        for Pakistan until October 25th. President Yahya did not return to Pakistan
                        from his State visit to Iran until November 5th.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after November 5, President Yahya called in the Chinese Communist
                        ambassador in Rawalpindi and explained his feeling that the U.S. is
                        interested in normalizing relations with Communist China and as a gesture
                        was withdrawing two destroyers from the Taiwan Straits. President Yahya
                        based what he said on his conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on August 1.</p>
                    <p>In a letter of November 28 to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>, Minister Sher Ali reported that the ambassador's
                        immediate reaction had been that the U.S. always “double-talked.” The
                        ambassador cited China's shooting down of a U.S. intelligence plane.
                        President Yahya asked the ambassador to convey President Yahya's views to
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> then said that on
                        December 13 he had received another letter from Minister Sher Ali reporting
                        the Chinese ambassador's reply after hearing from Peking. The Minister's
                        letter reported that reply in these words: “They appreciate our [the
                        Pakistani] role and efforts. As a result, they [the Chinese] had let off the
                        two Americans the other day.” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d1-02" facs="d1-02"/>surmised that the two Americans
                        referred to were two yachtsmen who had been recently released.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> asked whether there
                        is anything further of a substantive nature that could be discussed between
                        President Yahya and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.
                        Pakistan does not have a firm date yet for <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s visit. The Chinese had been trying to persuade
                        President Yahya to visit China first, but President Yahya has told them it
                        is their turn to visit Pakistan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> surmised that there might be some issue for China in
                        the fact that this would be <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        first foreign trip following the cultural revolution and it might have to be
                        related to other visits.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> suggested that
                        perhaps the prompt Chinese response in resuming the Warsaw talks had
                        resulted from the message the Pakistanis had passed to them.</p>
                    <p>In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>'s
                        question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we
                        could now do the following:</p>
                    <p>1. When a date for <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s visit
                        to Pakistan is settled, he would give to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> something that the Pakistanis could
                        say to the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>2. The Pakistanis could tell the Chinese now that the U.S. appreciates this
                        communication and that we are serious in our desire to have conversations
                        with them. If they want to have these conversations in a more secure manner
                        than Warsaw or in channels that are less widely disseminated within the
                        bureaucracy, the President would be prepared to do this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> noted that President
                        Yahya might pass these thoughts to the Chinese so that when <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> comes to Pakistan he can have
                        thought about this suggestion. When he asked whether Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, in referring to other channels,
                        intended to continue using the Pakistani channel, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said we have no problem doing
                        this through Pakistan but would be open to any other suggestions the Chinese
                        might have.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> noted the possibility
                        that should it be desirable <pb n="3" xml:id="d1-03" facs="d1-03"/>for this
                        channel to be active at a high level sooner than <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s visit to Pakistan, President Yahya is probably
                        now in a position to send Sher Ali himself to Peking. Delegations are going
                        back and forth now in the normal course of events.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that they would keep the
                        channel between them active.</p>
                    <p>A brief exchange of views on the Warsaw talks followed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said he assumed they were in the
                        nature of a preliminary exchange of views, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that this was consistent
                        with our impression.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> turned to the subject
                        of the forthcoming U.S. decision on military supply policy. He said that he
                        had been working for three years with members of the Congress urging them to
                        understand Pakistan's difficulties. Now the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                        has submitted a report which favors the resumption of military sales to
                        South Asia. He thought the State Department favored resumption of some sort
                        of arms sales and therefore he assumed that the question was up to the White
                        House. He noted that President Yahya would be going in the early spring to
                        the Soviet Union and then perhaps to China on visits and hoped that Pakistan
                        would have a decision on U.S. arms supply policy before then. He also noted
                        the important political steps that President Yahya has taken recently and
                        said that the U.S. military supply decision would be important support for
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> interjected that we are
                        not in the business of changing Pakistan's domestic structure, but he
                        acknowledged the fact that a U.S. decision might be helpful. He explained
                        that the decision should be made in the near future. The White House has not
                        been holding up this decision, but must hold a meeting on it, probably in
                        January. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that he
                        could not say what the answer would be, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said that it was important to have an
                        answer, whatever it might be, although he assumed that there were good
                        chances it would be favorable.</p>

                    <p>DATE AND PLACE: Tuesday, December 23, in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s Office</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> opened the conversation
                        by handing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> the
                        original of a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to President Yahya (Tab A). He noted that the
                        President wanted to stay in communication with the Pakistani President and
                        had asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to deliver
                        this on his behalf.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the President
                        had greatly appreciated the message that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> had given him on December 19. When
                        the date of <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s visit to
                        Pakistan is set, he will have more to say.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said that very
                        shortly after his return to the office following the December 19 talk with
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, he had received a
                        letter from President Yahya dated December 14. In that handwritten letter,
                        President Yahya had asked that the two following sentences be conveyed to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. “It is our assessment that the Chinese appear willing for resumption of
                        talks at Warsaw at the Ambassador level without insisting on
                        preconditions.”</p>
                    <p>2. “Quite apart from the public renunciation of the recent agreement between
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Japan, the Chinese are greatly
                        concerned over it and see in it a revival of Japanese militarism which will
                        threaten not only China but the whole of Southeast Asia.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said he was not sure
                        exactly how these points came to President Yahya. The letter from Minister
                        Sher Ali Khan to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>
                        which the Ambassador had reported to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> last week <pb n="2" xml:id="d2-02" facs="d2-02"/>had been written on December 13. This letter from President Yahya had been
                        written the following day. It appeared, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said, that he had felt that these two
                        points needed to be added to the communication from Sher Ali Khan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we appreciate
                        this communication very much.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said that the U. S.
                        would have a chance to judge the significance of this report when it
                        determined whether the message conformed to what the Chinese had said at
                        Warsaw.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> then presented the
                        brief letter from President Yahya (Tab B) thanking President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> for “his timely action” in helping
                        meet Pakistan's food needs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> accepted this and said
                        that he also had in mind the question about U.S. military supply policy
                        which the Ambassador had raised the previous day.</p>

                    <p>The American side was met at the front door of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Embassy by staff members and led to the second floor where
                        the Chargé, <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei Yang</persName>, and his staff
                        were waiting. Both sides introduced themselves and there were handshakes all

                    <p>Yeh Wei-lan - Scribe</p>
                    <p>The group then proceeded to a large conference room. Enroute to the
                        conference room, interpreter Ch'ien explained to Anderson that the two sides
                        would be seated as if at a meeting, and that the press would be permitted
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d3-02" facs="d3-02"/>to enter and make photographs.
                        After the photo session, he explained, the group would move to a smaller
                        room where the actual meeting would be conducted. It was agreed that,
                        following past practice, it was the U.S. turn to speak first and that the
                        Chinese side would propose the date for the next meeting. It was also agreed
                        that we would continue the practice of having an informal meeting on the day
                        following the formal meeting to discuss any technical problems which might
                        arise during the meeting.</p>

                        d'Affaires, today marks the first opportunity for both of us to represent
                        our respective governments in a formal meeting. In our informal
                        conversations December 11 and January 8, however, I described to you the
                        general spirit with which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> has instructed me to approach this meeting today. I
                        observed that the United States wished to improve relations between our two
                        countries, that it did not seek to stand in isolation from China or to join
                        in any condominium with the Soviet Union directed against China.
                        Specifically, we do not support the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine.</p>
                    <p>It is my Government's hope that today will mark a new beginning in our
                        relationship. It is our hope that together we can take a fresh and
                        constructive look at the whole range of possibilities for the improvement of
                        relations between our two countries. We hope to explore what practical steps
                        we can take to eliminate many of the barriers to those understandings from
                        which our two countries could mutually benefit. We do not deny that there
                        are serious differences between our two Governments. But we believe that we
                        should make every effort possible to overcome these and that it should be
                        possible to make progress in this effort.</p>
                    <p>The United States intends to honor its commitments but the United States has
                        no intention of attempting, either unilaterally or in concert with others,
                        to exclude the People's Republic of China from developing normal, friendly
                        relations with its Asian neighbors and pursuing its own legitimate national
                        interests in this area. It is in this sense that I believe that whatever
                        constructive <pb n="3" xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>contribution your
                        Government can make toward reaching a just and equitable peace in the area
                        and in easing the legitimate concerns of other Asian governments would
                        contribute toward more rapid achievement of the goal of a reduction of
                        military tension in the area and a reduced American military presence in
                        Southeast Asia, which we recognize is near the southern borders of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to discuss with you any proposals designed to improve
                        relations and reduce tensions between our two countries. These might include
                        agreements on trade, renunciation of the use of force, and matters related
                        to disarmament. Other subjects for discussion might be the exchange of
                        reporters, scholars, scientists, medical personnel and scientific
                        information. As recently as November 25, 1968, your proposal for resumption
                        of these meetings referred to the desirability of concluding an agreement on
                        the five principles of peaceful coexistence. There may be other topics your
                        Government would like to propose. Those I have mentioned are all specific
                        areas in which we feel that early and meaningful progress can be achieved.
                        Perhaps even more important, however, is achievement through our frank
                        discussions at these meetings of understanding between our two governments
                        on our objectives in Asia, their limits, and our mutual acceptance of the
                        fact that improvement in our relations serves the interests of both our
                        countries. It is my Government's sincere belief that substantive political
                        dialogue can and should be a significant contribution toward this goal.</p>
                    <p>Since coming to office in January 1969, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has taken several actions that give concrete
                        expression to our hope that barriers to normal intercourse between our two
                        peoples can gradually be lowered. On July 21 of last year my Government
                        eased its regulations on travel to the People's Republic of China and
                        amended its long standing trade restraints. On December 19 a further and
                        more significant amendment of our trade controls was announced. We are now
                        prepared, should you be interested, to discuss the whole question of trade
                        between our two countries and the settlement of outstanding debts and
                        obligations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires. Without doubt the single most complex problem existing
                        between our two sides is the question of Taiwan and the United States
                        relationship with the Republic of China. The United States will continue to
                        maintain its friendly relations with the Government in Taipei and honor its
                        commitment to that Government to assist it in defending Taiwan and the
                        Pescadores from military attack. However, the United States position in this
                        regard is without prejudice to any future peaceful settlement between your
                        Government and the Government in Taipei. Our only concern is that this issue
                        not be resolved by force of arms. In this same spirit we will also not
                        support and in fact will oppose any offensive military action from Taiwan
                        against the mainland. The limited United States military presence on Taiwan
                        is not a threat to the security of your Government, and it is our hope that
                        as peace and stability in Asia <pb n="4" xml:id="d3-04" facs="d3-04"/>grow,
                        we can reduce these facilities on Taiwan that we now have.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires. The problem of controlling weapons of mass destruction
                        is a vital question for peoples of every country. The talks on disarmament
                        started last year between the United States and the Soviet Union are not
                        designed to perpetuate the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the
                        Soviet Union or to threaten any other country. I made it abundantly clear in
                        my statement to you of January 8, and the United States has stated as
                        clearly as possible publicly, that it does not intend to interfere in the
                        disputes of others or seek to gain advantage from them. We think disarmament
                        is a matter of vital concern to the welfare of both our peoples and would
                        welcome an expression of interest on the part of your Government in
                        commencing bilateral discussions between our two governments on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>My Government and the people of the United States welcomed the release
                        December 7 of Bessie Hope Donald and Simeon Baldwin who inadvertently
                        entered Chinese-claimed territorial waters while sailing from Hong Kong to
                        Macau. There remains, however, the longstanding question of the remaining
                        Americans being held in prison by your authorities. Anyone familiar with
                        American people of all political views will agree that the question of
                        United States citizens imprisoned or missing in China is one of great
                        concern to them. Forward movement on this issue, through the release of
                        those now held or, at minimum, through identification of those held and
                        permission for visits by family members, would be a constructive move toward
                        improved relations between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires. If as these talks progress it would seem to be useful
                        and your Government would so desire, my Government would be prepared to
                        consider sending a representative to Peking for direct discussions with your
                        officials or receiving a representative from your Government in Washington
                        for more thorough exploration of any of the subjects I have mentioned in my
                        remarks today or other matters on which we might agree.</p>
                    <p>In any event, in closing, Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, I would like to restate once
                        again my Government's hope that regular contacts between us can take place
                        at frequent intervals and that these talks will enable us to move toward a
                        new phase in Sino-American relations based on mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>This concludes my statement.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d3-05" facs="d3-05"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ambassador, in dealing with the question of relations between countries
                        having different social systems, the Government of the People's Republic of
                        China, following the principles of diplomatic policy personally set forth by
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse Tung</persName>, has
                        consistently stood for peaceful coexistence based on the principles of
                        mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual
                        non-aggression, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, equality
                        and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. In pursuing these principles
                        the Chinese Government has in the past twenty years established and
                        developed normal friendly relations with many countries. These principles
                        initiated by our Government have won active support and warm praise from all
                        countries and peoples of the world who genuinely cherish peace. Only by
                        strictly adhering to the five principles can peaceful coexistence be
                        realized. If one country forcibly occupies the territory of another country,
                        encroaches on its sovereignty, and interferes in the internal affairs of
                        that country, how can one speak of peaceful coexistence? The People's
                        Republic of China never will commit aggression or interfere in other
                        countries, but on no account can it tolerate interference and aggression
                        against China by other countries, wherever the interference and aggression
                        may come from.</p>
                    <p>In your statement read out at our meeting on the 8th, Mr. Ambassador
                        expressed the wish of the U.S. Government to widen the dialogue and contacts
                        between us but failed to mention a single word about Taiwan. We must point
                        out that there have long existed serious disputes between China and the U.S.
                        and that the crux of these lies in the question of Taiwan. This question is
                        a political one, having direct bearing on the five principles of peaceful
                        coexistence. It is not a question of ideology. Taiwan is an inalienable part
                        of China's territory; it is a province of the People's Republic of China.
                        Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, to which the U.S.
                        Government affixed its signature, explained that Taiwan and the Pescadores
                        Islands should be returned to China. Even as late as January 5, 1950, the
                        then U.S. President and Secretary of State still issued solemn statements
                        recognizing that Taiwan is China's territory. Shortly afterward, in June
                        1950, the U.S. Government, using the Korean War as a pretext, dispatched the
                        Seventh Fleet to Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area, and has since been
                        occupying the area by force of arms. An armistice in the Korean War was
                        brought about as early as 1953. But not only has the U.S. Government failed
                        to pull out its forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area, what is
                        more, it signed in December 1954 the so-called Treaty of Joint Defense with
                        the Chiang Kai Shek clique, which has long been repudiated by the Chinese
                        people, in an attempt to legalize by this treaty this occupation of Taiwan.
                        Thereafter the U.S. Government has all along <pb n="6" xml:id="d3-06" facs="d3-06"/>used Taiwan as a base for continuing to pose war threats
                        against the Chinese people and to use it for maneuvers to carry out “two
                        China” or “one China-one Taiwan” activities in an attempt to separate Taiwan
                        from China. Recently the U.S. Government still talked a great deal about
                        pledging to honor its so-called treaty commitments to the <persName>Chiang
                            Kai Shek</persName> clique and announced it would give the Chiang clique
                        a batch of military planes. All of this constitutes interference and
                        aggression against China. The Chinese people will assuredly liberate Taiwan;
                        this is a question of China's internal affairs. The Chinese people
                        absolutely will not allow any country to occupy Chinese territory and to
                        interfere in its internal affairs. With regard to this question of important
                        political principles, the position of the Chinese Government is firm and
                        unswerving. All fond hopes that China will change its position are doomed to
                        fail.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ambassador, the talks between China and the U.S. have gone on for over
                        ten years. In the course of these talks, the U. S. Government has invariably
                        advanced an evasive attitude toward the questions of fundamental principles
                        between the two countries and has confined itself to side issues, thus
                        preventing the talks achieving results on fundamental issues between the two
                        countries. Now that the U.S. Government wishes to increase the dialogue with
                        our country and improve Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations,
                        presumably the question of how to deal with the fundamental principles of
                        the relations of our two countries is already under your consideration. The
                        Chinese Government has always stood for the peaceful settlement of disputes
                        between China and the U.S. through negotiations; it has done so in the past
                        and is prepared to do likewise in the future. We would welcome studies and
                        explorations on the fundamental question of how to settle relations between
                        the two countries. We are willing to consider and discuss whatever ideas and
                        suggestions the U.S. Government might put forward in accordance with the
                        five principles of peaceful coexistence, therefore really helping to reduce
                        tensions between China and the U.S. and fundamentally improve relations
                        between China and the U.S. These talks may either continue to be conducted
                        at the ambassadorial level or may be conducted at a higher level or through
                        other channels acceptable to both sides. I have carefully listened to the
                        statement the Ambassador just made. We will study it and set forth our views
                        at the next meeting.</p>
                    <p>I said:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, I listened carefully and with interest to the views
                        expressed by you in your statement. I noted in particular the position
                        expressed by you concerning the problem of Taiwan. As I said in my statement
                        today, the position of the U.S. on this <pb n="7" xml:id="d3-07" facs="d3-07"/>subject is without prejudice to any future peaceful
                        settlement between your Government and the Government in Taipei. Our only
                        concern is that this issue not be resolved by force of arms, and I note from
                        your statement that you also believe this issue should be settled
                        peacefully. For this reason, I feel that we are in agreement that this
                        problem should be resolved peacefully, and I believe that through such an
                        approach we can make progress in solving our bilateral problems and
                        improving our relations.</p>
                    <p>At this point, in my view, it would be advisable to report to our Governments
                        what has been said today and to consider the subjects which might be taken
                        up at our next meeting. Of course, we will be prepared to hear anything else
                        today which the Chargé would wish to raise. If there is nothing more from
                        your side, we would have nothing more and would be interested in suggestions
                        from the Chargé as to when we would meet again.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ambassador, I would only like to add a few points. With regard to Mr.
                        Ambassador's proposal regarding sending a representative either to Peking or
                        to Washington, I will transmit the proposal to my Government. As I already
                        pointed out, the position of my Government on the question of Taiwan is very
                        clear and known to everybody. The so-called treaty concluded by the U.S. and
                        the Chiang Kai Shek clique is not recognized by the whole Chinese people.
                        And I must point out that Taiwan is not a state; it is part of the People's
                        Republic of China. Mr. Ambassador must be aware that there is only one
                        China: this is the People's Republic of China. If Mr. Ambassador has nothing
                        more to say, may I make a proposal for the date of our next meeting?</p>
                    <p>I said:</p>
                    <p>I have heard with attention what you have said. I understand your views
                        concerning Taiwan, and I hope that you have understood the point of view
                        that I have presented in my statement. I will report to my Government
                        everything you have said today, including what you mentioned regarding
                        meetings at a higher level. I believe the Chargé also mentioned that the
                        meetings might be in another channel, and I would like to inquire what might
                        be involved. Any explanation from the Chargé would be useful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said:</p>
                    <p>Concerning the question of the Chinese territory of Taiwan, which Mr.
                        Ambassador has mentioned, I have already explained in clear <pb n="8" xml:id="d3-08" facs="d3-08"/>terms the position of my Government.
                        Therefore I would not like to repeat them. Mr. Ambassador also mentioned the
                        question of talks at a higher level or through other channels. If the U. S.
                        Government is interested in talks at a higher level or through other
                        channels, you may put forward your draft proposal, or a draft proposal may
                        be worked out through consultation of the two sides at these ambassadorial
                        talks. If Mr. Ambassador has nothing more to say, may I make a proposal for
                        the date of the next meeting? I propose that the date of the next meeting be
                        decided on later through consultation via the liaison personnel of our two
                        sides. Mr. Ch'ien will be liaison officer of our side.</p>
                    <p>I said:</p>
                    <p>I accept, and I look forward to meeting again at an early date. Our liaison
                        man will be Mr. Simons.</p>

                    <p>Well, shall we conclude our meeting today?</p>
                    <p>I said:</p>
                    <p>We always have the question of the press. (<persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> and Ch'ien chuckled when they heard the statement in
                        interpretation.) There are many press people today outside your Embassy. I
                        would plan to say when they question me that “Chinese Chargé d'Affaires
                            <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei Yang</persName> and I met for one hour
                        today and discussed a number of matters of mutual interest. By mutual
                        agreement, however, our discussions and the topics we covered are held in
                        confidence. No specific date was set for the next meeting but it is agreed
                        that we would be in touch at an early date to consider this question
                        further. The meeting was conducted in a businesslike atmosphere. (Ch'ien
                        clarified the word “business-like” to Lei during interpretation.) We are
                        pleased that these talks have been renewed today and I believe today's
                        meeting was useful.” This is all I would say to the press.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Mr. Ambassador, on the question of releasing news to the press, we can act on
                        past practice, each side releases its own news to the press.</p>
                    <p>I said:</p>

                    <p>The American side met the Chinese side in the lobby of the American Embassy.
                        The two principals shook hands and, after the two sides had stood briefly to
                        allow press photography, proceeded together by elevator to the Embassy

                    <p>I opened the meeting.</p>
                    <p>I said: Mr. Chargé, I am pleased to welcome you today to the American Embassy
                        and would be very glad to hear any statement you wish to make.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: First of all I would like to
                        thank Mr. Ambassador for your words of welcome.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ambassador. At the 135th meeting, you formally stated that the United
                        States Government wishes to improve Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        relations and to relax the tensions between the two countries. You also said
                        that every effort possible should be made to overcome the serious
                        difficulties existing between the two countries and that you looked forward
                        to progress in this respect. The Chinese Government expresses its welcome to
                        these indications from the United States Government. The Chinese Government
                        has all along stood for conducting relations with countries of different
                        social systems in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful
                        Coexistence and for settlement of disputes between China and the United
                        States through peaceful negotiation. As far back as 1955 we openly declared
                        that the Chinese people are friendly to the American people. The Chinese
                        people do not want to have a war with the United States of America. The
                        Chinese Government is willing to sit down and enter into negotiations with
                        the United States of America to discuss the question of relaxing tensions in
                        the Far East, and especially to discuss relaxing tensions in the Taiwan
                        area. This is what we have done consistently in the past fifteen years, and
                        we are prepared to continue to do so in the future. The United States should
                        be aware of this position of the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>We noted that in Mr. Ambassador's statement of January 20, you did not evade
                        the crucial question in Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations.
                        You referred to the question of concluding an agreement on the Five
                        Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and dwelt upon the Taiwan question in
                        some detail, admitting that this is the single most complicated problem in
                        the relations between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>But at the same time you listed a series of other questions which you
                        considered could be discussed, among which were not only questions
                        concerning relations between the two countries but some international
                        questions, and among the questions concerning relations between the two
                        countries some were side issues. In this way, primary and secondary are
                        confused and essential and non-essential are reversed. Thus the crucial
                        question in the relations between the two countries is blurred.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d4-03" facs="d4-03"/>
                    <p>We have consistently held that the question of fundamental principle in the
                        relations between the two countries should first of all be solved and that
                        is the Taiwan question, which is related to the Five Principles of Peaceful
                        Coexistence. Only when this question is solved can fundamental improvement
                        be brought about in Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations and the
                        settlement of other questions be promoted. We are fully aware that the
                        settlement of the Taiwan question requires making every effort to create the
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>The Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ambassadorial talks which had been
                        suspended for two years have now been resumed. In your statement at the
                        first meeting, you expressed the hope that this would mark a new beginning.
                        We also wish the same. However, we cannot but point out with regret that on
                        the crucial Taiwan question there has still not been much change in your
                        basic position. While indicating your wish to improve relations with the
                        People's Republic of China, you declared that you intended to maintain
                        “friendly” relations with the Chiang Kai Shek clique long overthrown by the
                        Chinese people. While expressing willingness to discuss with us the Five
                        Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, you declared your intention to honor the
                        so-called “commitment” to the Chiang Kai Shek clique. Is this not
                        self-contradictory? Although in your statement at the previous meeting you
                        said that you considered the Government of the People's Republic of China
                        has the right to settle the Taiwan question as its own internal affair, you
                        still do not give up the position of creating “two Chinas” or “one China,
                        one Taiwan”, and you are very clear that this is what the entire Chinese
                        people absolutely will not accept.</p>
                    <p>In order to resolve this important contradiction “more thorough exploration
                        is indeed necessary”, as said by Mr. Ambassador at the first meeting. There
                        are certain difficulties in undertaking this task in the ambassadorial talks
                        between the two countries. It appears that our two sides have both foreseen
                        this situation. At the first meeting both came forward separately with the
                        same view, that talks at a higher level might be held, and you went even
                        further putting forward the idea of sending a representative to Peking or to
                        Washington for discussion. If the U. S. Government wishes to send a
                        representative of ministerial rank or a special envoy of the United States
                        President to Peking for further exploration of questions of fundamental
                        principle between China and the United States, the Chinese Government will
                        be willing to receive him.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d4-04" facs="d4-04"/>
                    <p>Mr. Ambassador. I would like to emphasize once again the importance of
                        settling the crucial question between China and the United States. Once a
                        way to settle this question is found, the way will be paved for the
                        settlement of other questions. As for the side issues in relations between
                        the two countries, they are not difficult to solve. For instance, with
                        regard to questions of U.S. criminals in China which you mentioned in your
                        statement at the last meeting, customary practice can be followed; packets
                        and letters can be transmitted, and visits by family members can be arranged
                        through the Red Cross societies of the two countries, and this can still be
                        done in the future.</p>
                    <p>That's all I have to say.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d4-05" facs="d4-05"/>
                    <p>I said: Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, the views of your Government, which you
                        expressed at our meeting on January 20, have been given careful
                        consideration at the highest level of my Government. I have listened with
                        great interest to your remarks here today. I feel, as I suggested at our
                        last meeting, that in spirit the views of our two governments on a number of
                        issues may be closer now than they have been since these talks first began
                        in 1955. I sincerely hope this is the case.</p>
                    <p>At our meeting on January 20 and again today, Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, you have
                        emphasized the importance to your Government of the question of Taiwan and
                        the necessity for some progress toward the resolution of this issue as part
                        of any general improvement of Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        relations. The question of Taiwan is, without doubt, a major obstacle to
                        better relations between our two governments, and we hope that as these
                        meetings progress we will be able to arrive at some meeting of minds on this
                        subject. My Government feels, however, that in our discussions we can and
                        should move forward simultaneously, not only on the question of Taiwan, but
                        also on the whole range of bilateral issues between our two countries.
                        Progress on some such issues can be expected to contribute toward further
                        progress on others. We have a problem of atmosphere, of building of
                        confidence. This is essential to the easing of tensions and in turn, will
                        contribute to a more rapid resolution of the more fundamental problems
                        between us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, let me state as clearly and as frankly as possible our
                        position on the question of Taiwan. It is my Government's position that the
                        question of the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland of China is one
                        to be resolved by those directly involved. While we will continue to adhere
                        to the principle that the resolution of this question should be by peaceful
                        means, without resort to the threat or use of force, we do not intend to
                        interfere in any peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question which might be
                        reached between the People's Republic of China and the government in Taipei.
                        Our relationships with the Republic of China are consistent with that
                        position. The limited United States military presence in this area is not
                        designed to influence the political settlement of this problem nor is it a
                        threat to the security of the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, it is
                        my Government's intention to reduce those military facilities which we now
                        have on Taiwan as tensions in the area diminish. I believe my Government's
                        position on this <pb n="6" xml:id="d4-06" facs="d4-06"/>question is
                        consistent with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and my
                        Government is willing, should you agree, to discuss with you a joint
                        declaration incorporating the principles which I have discussed and
                        affirming our two governments adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful
                        Coexistence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires; at our meeting on January 20 you stated that your
                        Government is willing to consider and discuss whatever ideas and suggestions
                        my Government might put forward in accordance with the Five Principles of
                        Peaceful Coexistence, therefore really helping to reduce tensions between
                        China and the United States.</p>
                    <p>I will not review again today all the proposals which I mentioned in my
                        statement of January 20 on which my Government feels that meaningful
                        progress can be made. I would, however, like to mention one or two specific
                        matters relating to the question of greater contacts between our two
                        peoples. As you know, my Government has progressively eased its regulations
                        on travel to the People's Republic of China which were imposed in 1950. On
                        March 15 of this year these regulations must again either be renewed or
                        abolished. We are seriously considering their non-renewal in the hope that
                        this will contribute to freer contact between the people of our two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, my Government has amended its regulations governing trade with the
                        People's Republic of China, permitting at least the beginning of an exchange
                        of goods between our two peoples. The United States believes that further
                        amendment of our controls on trade should be possible in the near future. An
                        expression of interest on your part in improving and developing contacts in
                        such areas would be noted with great interest by my Government and the
                        American people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, as you know, in December of 1950 my Government and the
                        Government of the People's Republic of China both took action to block the
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="d4-07" facs="d4-07"/>financial assets of the other
                        country's citizens. The effect of these actions has been to prevent the
                        development of trade and the settlement of obligations legitimately owed to
                        the other side. Your Government in the past has expressed interest in
                        resolving these questions. I am prepared, should you be interested, to
                        discuss arrangements for the expansion of trade in general and for the
                        settlement of all debts between our two countries, including the unblocking
                        of those financial assets now controlled by both sides.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, at our meeting on January 20 I indicated the
                        importance with which the American people view the question of United States
                        citizens who are either missing or held prisoner in China. I want to
                        emphasize again that progress on this issue would be taken as a welcome sign
                        that our two countries have moved away from the old hostilities of the past
                        and have moved toward a new and more constructive relationship. For example,
                        in those cases where an American has nearly completed his prison sentence,
                        it would be a small but significant step if your Government could arrange to
                        commute the short period which still remains and enable him to return to the
                        United States. The families of Americans who are missing in the area of
                        China inquire regularly about the fate of these men. Simple confirmation of
                        whether they are alive or dead would be greatly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, I would like to express my Government's
                        pleasure that this series of ambassadorial-level meetings has been resumed
                        and that we have met again after only one month. As I indicated in our
                        previous meeting, the United States is prepared to consider with you the
                        possibility of sending a representative to your country or receiving your
                        representative in the United States, should progress at these talks indicate
                        that this would be useful in improving relations between our two countries.
                        I have noted your specific statement today, about receiving a representative
                        in Peking, and I will transmit it to my Government. As you know, it is my
                        Government's view that these exchanges can make a valuable contribution
                        toward the gradual resolution of the problems between our two countries. I
                        believe we have made a useful start, and I hope that we will be able to make
                        further progress based on a spirit of mutual understanding.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d4-08" facs="d4-08"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: Mr. Ambassador. I have
                        listened to your statement carefully. On the question of Taiwan, I have
                        clearly set forth the position and attitude of our Government in my
                        statement made at our first meeting as well as in my statement today. I will
                        therefore not repeat them again. As regards your statement today, I will
                        report this to my Government. I am not prepared to make any comment on such
                        concrete questions as trade, exchange of personnel, exchanges of visits by
                        personnel of our two countries, that you have mentioned today. That's
                        all.</p>
                    <p>I said: Mr. Chargé. I noted that you referred in your statement to the
                        question of letters, packages, and visits by family members to prisoners in
                        China. This of course is welcomed as a continuation of your policies of the
                        past. However, unfortunately this does not carry us any further beyond the
                        present situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, in my statement today I mentioned the question of
                        prisoners who have nearly completed their sentences and those Americans
                        missing in the area of China. I would like to mention specifically two
                        persons as examples of the type of cases we have in mind. Robert Fecteau,
                        who was captured by your authorities in 1951, has nearly completed the
                        twenty years to which he was sentenced, and the wife of Lt. Joseph Dunn,
                        whose plane was, shot down near Hainan Island, frequently asks about his
                        fate. I hope that your Government will give sympathetic consideration to the
                        view I have set forward on those cases, as well as to the more general
                        problem posed by other Americans either imprisoned or missing in China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé, on another question, I would like to ask a question for
                        clarification. You mentioned higher-level meetings. Is it your understanding
                        and preference that a higher-level meeting would replace our
                        ambassadorial-level meetings, or would you envisage that we would continue
                        our ambassadorial-level meetings in preparation for any higher-level meeting
                        in the future?</p>
                    <p>That's all.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: I am not prepared to make
                        any further comments today on the question of American prisoners in China.
                        But I will report what Mr. Ambassador has said today on this question to my
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>As regards the question of meetings at a higher level, which Mr. Ambassador
                        has referred to in your statement, I have <pb n="9" xml:id="d4-09" facs="d4-09"/>already indicated our position very clearly in my
                        statement today (sic), but I will be interested in listening to any ideas
                        Mr. Ambassador has on this question.</p>
                    <p>If on this question, that is, meetings at a higher level, if Mr. Ambassador
                        has any ideas or any suggestions, I'll be ready to report them to my
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>I said: On the question of higher-level meetings, we naturally would like to
                        provide the U. S. Government with as clear an idea as possible of what you
                        have in mind. For example, one question which might arise concerning such a
                        meeting is whether such a visit would be given publicity or would be
                        maintained in confidence. Any other indications from your Government as to
                        your views would be appreciated. However, if you are not able to add today
                        to what you have said on this subject, I will report to my Government what
                        you have stated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: Well, Mr. Ambassador, I have
                        nothing more to say today.</p>
                    <p>I said: Mr. Chargé, would you like me to make a suggestion with regard to our
                        next meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: Yes, please.</p>
                    <p>I said: I would suggest that we handle the question the same way as last
                        time, that is that our liaison officers are to be in touch with regard to
                        our next meeting, which would be at your Embassy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: I agree to Mr. Ambassador's
                        suggestion regarding the date for our next meeting, that is, that the date
                        would be discussed and decided on later by our liaison personnel. Since this
                        time our side proposed the date, it would be your turn to propose the date
                        for the next meeting.</p>
                    <p>I said: We agree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chargé, again with regard to the press, I suggest that we handle the
                        press the same way as last time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: Yes. I agree.</p>
                    <p>I said: Mr. Chargé, I think we are finished with official business for today,
                        and would like to invite you for tea in my office next door.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d4-10" facs="d4-10"/>
                    <p>(<persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> began to answer before the
                        interpretation. Ch'ien reminded him of the need to await the interpretation.
                        Anderson asked <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> whether he had
                        understood everything. He replied—laughing with some embarrassment—that he
                        had but nonetheless invited Anderson to interpret.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> said: I thank you for your
                        invitation, but since I already have appointments, that question of having a
                        cup of tea can be settled through our liaison personnel. We can find some
                        other time. I will let you know. Thank you for the concrete arrangements for
                        this meeting and for your hospitality. Goodbye.</p>
                    <p>(On departing, <persName corresp="#p_LY1">Lei</persName> made a brief
                        statement, interpreted into English by Ch'ien, to the press in the lobby. It

                        and that the two sides would be in touch concerning the date of the next

                        today, in <persName>Henry</persName>'s absence, and asked that the following
                        information be passed to you:</p>
                    <p>“The message which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> gave
                        him on April 28 was transmitted directly to President Yahya that same
                        evening. President Yahya has cabled <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> confirming that Yahya personally conveyed the message
                        to the Ambassador of Communist China on Saturday morning, May 1. It most
                        probably reached Chou-En-lai the same day or the following day.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> stated he wanted this message
                        conveyed because of the criticism from Peking against your Administration,
                        reported in this morning's press. He stated that in his view, while Peking
                        had received your message of April 28th, they were already reacting to two
                        things:</p>
                    <p>— The State Department spokesman's statement that the two Chinas could
                        negotiate their problems with each other, and</p>
                    <p>— Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' statement in
                        London.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> said that he had sent
                        a telegram to President Yahya Friday morning after the press conference,
                        saying that your statement of Thursday evening appeared to be an effort to
                        correct the damage done by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> recommended that Yahya pass on this interpretion to
                        the Chinese Ambassador. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> also
                        confirmed that a message had been conveyed to the Chinese to the effect that
                        your hands would be tied if other American politicians <pb n="2" xml:id="d5-02" facs="d5-02"/>are brought into the matter of U.S.-Peking
                        relations. Therefore, it would be best if the Chinese Government would not
                        discuss the matter with any other American politician until a solid
                        government-to-government channel has been established. This does not mean
                        that there is any objection from here to the continuation of the
                        people-to-people program and we would welcome invitations to other kinds of
                        American visitors - students, reporters, scholars, etc.</p>

                    <p>Date: Friday, May 7, 1971—2:50 - 5:45 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Place: 1836 Aquanetta Circle, Palm Springs, California (Home of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Theodore</persName> Cummings)</p>
                    <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> stated that the State Department had accepted his
                        cover story without question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed appreciation for the cables sent by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>, and for his
                        loyalty over the past weeks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then stated that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was preparing to submit
                        a devastating report concluding that it would take $250 million to give
                        Pakistan breathing room; he then asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> whether it is, in fact, possible to
                        provide breathing room, and whether $250 million is a realistic estimate of
                        the support required. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> replied that although he thought it would be
                        possible, there are some real problems to contend with:</p>
                    <p>— Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KKB1">Keating</persName> seems to have
                        gone berserk; he has violated security and appears determined to break
                        Pakistan. For example, he recently called in a New York Times reporter and,
                        although he did not release the text, he did tell him the essence of Blood's
                        report. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> is
                        convinced that <persName corresp="#p_KKB1">Keating</persName> is determined
                        to make a political issue out of the Pakistani situation, and is attempting
                        to discredit the Administation in the process.</p>
                    <p>— Another problem is the quality of political reporting in Dacca. The
                        reporters there are missionaries without significant practical experience.
                        They have never before seen war and are grossly exaggerating the amount of
                        killing and bloodshed there.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d6-02" facs="d6-02"/>
                    <p>Moving to the primary item of business, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> that for some time, we have been
                        passing messages to the Chinese through the Pakistanis. Because of the
                        communications problem, it had not been possible to inform Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> of this previously, and
                        messages have been conveyed directly to Yahya by the President, or through
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then outlined the exchange of
                        messages that has occurred to date:</p>
                    <p>— The channel was established in August, 1969. At that time, while visiting
                        Pakistan, the President indicated to President Yahya (and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> told the former Air Force Chief
                        of Staff) that the United States desired to normalize relations with
                        China.</p>
                    <p>— President Yahya then called in the Chinese Ambassador who thanked him for
                        his interest and indicated that China would be interested in hearing
                        something positive.</p>
                    <p>— Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then told Hilaly that
                        we would remove two destroyers from the Taiwan Straits as a gesture of good
                        will. (In point of fact, this had already been decided for budgetary
                        reasons.)</p>
                    <p>— The Chinese responded by releasing two American yachtsmen.</p>
                    <p>— Two days or a week later, the Chinese told Yahya that they were willing to
                        resume talks in Warsaw. They also expressed concern about the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>— In a subsequent message delivered by Yahya, it was said that a war between
                        China and the U.S. is seen now as a very remote possibility.</p>
                    <p>— For a while, the Rumanian channel was used; then, when Yahya came to the
                        U.S. in October, the President suggested to him that the Chinese could begin
                        talking to us in secure channels.—On December 9, 1970, the Chinese replied
                        as follows (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stressed
                        that this must be treated with the greatest sensitivity):</p>
                    <p>“This (meaning the reply) is not from me alone but from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Lin Piao</persName> as well. China has always been
                        willing and has always tried to negotiate <pb n="3" xml:id="d6-03" facs="d6-03"/>by peaceful means. A special envoy of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s will be most welcome in Peking. We
                        have had messages from the United States from different sources in the past,
                        but this is the first time that the proposal has come from a Head, through a
                        Head, to a Head.”</p>
                    <p>— We replied in early January: “In the light of the remarks of Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> to President Yahya, as
                        well as the continuing United States interest in U.S. -China discussions at
                        a higher level, the United States Government believes it would be useful to
                        begin discussions with a view of bringing about a higher level meeting in
                        Peking. The meeting in Peking would not be limited to the Taiwan question
                        but would encompass other steps designed to improve relations and reduce
                        tensions. The United States therefore proposed that representatives of the
                        two Governments meet at an early convenient moment in a location convenient
                        to both sides to discuss the modalities of the higher-level meeting. These
                        modalities would include the size of the delegations, the duration of the
                        meeting, the agenda and a clear understanding on the status and amenities
                        which the U.S. delegation would enjoy while in the People's Republic of
                        China.” Orally, we suggested that the preliminary meeting be in
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>— Last week, we received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> a message probably written by the Chinese: “The
                        Chinese Government reaffirms its willingness to receive publicly in Peking a
                        Special Envoy of the President of the U.S. (for instance, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>) or the U.S. Secretary of State
                        or even the President of the U.S. himself for a direct meeting and
                        discussions. Of course, if the U.S. President considers that the time is not
                        yet ripe, the matter may be deferred to a later date. As for the modalities,
                        procedure and other details of the high-level meeting and discussions in
                        Peking, as they are of no substantive significance, it is believed that it
                        is entirely possible for proper arrangements to be made through the good
                        offices of President <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">Yahya
                        Khan</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stressed that these
                        developments could be of great diplomatic significance, both with respect to
                        Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Because (outside of the President), Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is the only person who
                        can talk to the Chinese understanding all of the inter-related aspects of
                        the negotiations, it is desired that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> be the first contact—the subsequent one to be with
                        the President himself.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d6-04" facs="d6-04"/>
                    <p>— Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that we intend
                        to reply that the U.S. is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues and
                        cannot confine the meeting to one topic. Each side will be free to raise
                        whatever issues are of concern to them. The President is prepared to go to
                        Peking, but there should be a preliminary secret meeting between Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Cho En-Lai</persName> at which time Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will be empowered to select a
                        time and the general circumstances of a Presidential visit—possibly next
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then indicated to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> that the President
                        will not go to Peking unless Vietnam is concluded. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will propose to meet with
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> or his representative
                        either in Pakistan or a location in Southern China which is easily
                        accessible from Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>TECHNICAL DETAILS OF MEETING</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> proceeded to discuss a number of
                        technical details related to the meeting between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> would receive a copy of
                        everything given to Yahya. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> if he thought <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> would permit our messages to be ready
                        by the foreign office. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> thought there was no danger of this since, in his
                        view, <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> does not trust either his
                        staff or the foreign office.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> next raised the question
                        of whether our next message should be delivered to Yahya through <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> or through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> whether it would be
                        possible to get to Pakistan without attracting attention. The Ambassador
                        felt that a visit by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        could be easily explained in terms of the East-West crisis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> next questioned whether
                        it would be better to meet in Pakistan where the Pakistanis would tape the
                        meeting—or in China <pb n="5" xml:id="d6-05" facs="d6-05"/>where the Chinese
                        would do the taping. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> felt the latter would be preferable, and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> outlined a proposed
                        itinerary in which he would go to Vietnam on an inspection trip, stop in
                        Bangkok, New Delhi, Islamibad on Friday, have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> take him off for the weekend—and
                        then go to Southern China for roughly 24 hours. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated he would then go on to
                        Tehran on Monday. He will probably travel in one of the large Presidential
                        aircraft—possibly Air Force 2.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if there were an
                        American Press Corps in Rawalpindi; Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> said there was one fellow named Zeiber.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that he could
                        say he was going to the Khyber Pass or to the hill station, and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> could cover for him.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> stated that Yahya
                        has a summer house which could be used; it would be best if President Yahya
                        invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> there for the
                        weekend. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> stated
                        that the Chinese have an airfield just the other side of the mountains which
                        could be used for the meeting.</p>
                    <p>COMMUNICATIONS</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated there were
                        several possible channels which he could use in communicating with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>:</p>
                    <p>— [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>— [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>— Navy Channel ending in Karachi (a commercial plane would have to be used to
                        get the message up to Rawalpindi, however).</p>
                    <p>— Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> could be shown
                        how to use one-time pads (however, encryption and decryption each take about
                        four hours).</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] The Ambassador felt the Navy
                        channel would probably be best; in his own office only his (non-State
                        Department) secretary <pb n="6" xml:id="d6-06" facs="d6-06"/>would handle
                        the messages. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> felt
                        it would be best to have the special Navy communicator in Karachi where the
                        Attache is stationed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        stated that [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] he would have the
                        Navy Channel set up by next week (Monday, if possible), after Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> clears the Attache (named
                        Dros).</p>
                    <p>TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he presently
                        thought he would leave Rawalpindi Saturday morning and return Sunday
                        evening—with a stay in China of about 24 hours to permit three separate
                        sessions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> pointed out that he
                        would be expected to have a large reception for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> who agreed that everything
                        required by protocol must be done to avoid arousing suspicion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> raised the question of
                        whether the country director at State should be permitted to send a
                        representative along on the trip—which would pose real problems in Pakistan.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> suggested that the
                        Vietnam country director be permitted to send his representative on that
                        portion of the trip only.</p>
                    <p>PAKISTAN'S ECONOMIC SITUATION</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he would
                        talk to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on Monday, May 10,
                        and tell him that Yahya must be kept afloat for six more months; one problem
                        will be that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is emotionally
                        against Yahya—as is the entire liberal community. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> pointed out that matters won't be
                        helped by the fact that <persName corresp="#p_KKB1">Keating</persName> is
                        now on his way back to conduct a series of conferences, including some with
                        his old Senate confreres. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he would tell <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that this is the only channel we
                        have, and he must give Yahya at least three months. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> stated that six months should be
                        the goal.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> stated that he had
                        urged Yahya to tell his staff to make a new presentation to the consortium.
                        Ahmad is coming to the United States next week, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> has stressed this to him. The
                        Ambassador stated that one inherent problem is that the lower echelon in the
                        Pakistani bureaucracy feels they have a commitment from China to support
                        operations in East Pakistan. Although <pb n="7" xml:id="d6-07" facs="d6-07"/>Japan is negative in their position, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> felt that Germany will not let
                        Pakistan go down the drain and the British will probably help as well. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked whether the $250
                        million will be applied entirely to debt re-scheduling—and whether Yahya
                        could propose a plan applicable to West Pakistan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> thought some of the $250 million
                        would be a new loan, and that a consortium proposal would be geared to East
                        Pakistan with the West receiving/administering the funds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> next asked what he could
                        do bureaucratically to help. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> said that the most important contribution would be
                        to get <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to head up the
                        consortium. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied
                        that he did not think <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would
                        agree to this because it would antagonize his liberal friends. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> then pointed out that the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> was another possibility that should
                        not be overlooked. Assali had previously requested a standby loan from the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> which was turned down; however, the
                        loan request could be reactivated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that he would take this issue up with
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>, and that he would report on his
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> through the
                        Navy channel. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>POLITICAL SITUATION</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked how it was that
                        the election results were so unexpected. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> said that everyone has missed in
                        their predictions. In East Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Rahman</persName> had been able to capitalize on the cyclone. When the
                        western nations began to pour in assistance, the Benghalis realized for the
                        first time that they were part of the world. In the West, everyone had
                        thought the landowners could continue to retain substantial support.</p>
                    <p>* * * *</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> voiced some mild
                        complaints about living in Pakistan and expressed the hope that if the China
                        meeting came off successfully, a new post could be offered. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied noncommittally that if
                        this gets done, “we will owe you a great debt of gratitude.”</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d6-08" facs="d6-08"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if there is any
                        way West Pakistan can hold on to East Pakistan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> said no, not in the long run. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then said that all we
                        need is six months. East Benghal is bound to become an economic disaster;
                        Chinese influence will grow there, and, it will not be possible to win any
                        permanent friends there. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> agreed and pointed out the difficulty of making a
                        financial commitment to the Benghalis.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> asked if Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> could have Hanna pass
                        the word down through regular channels that we are going to work things out
                        and support the government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he would insure this gets done. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> then said that our
                        interest in trying to save Pakistan be conveyed to the heads of government
                        in Britain, Germany—and possibly also Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he might be going to Britain on other
                        business and would speak to Heath about this. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> pointed out that at this point, the
                        other members of the consortium do not know our position.</p>
                    <p>SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated, by way of
                        summary, that he would:</p>
                    <p>(1) Have Hanna told that we want a positive attitude and six months time;</p>
                    <p>(2) Talk to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> along the lines
                        above;</p>
                    <p>(3) Look into the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Loan;</p>
                    <p>(4) Personally talk to Heath;</p>
                    <p>(5) Have <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">Rush</persName> talk to <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> in two weeks time—or, in any event,
                        before the end of the month; and</p>
                    <p>(6) Possibly get the State Department to get to Japan if there is a
                        convenient way to do this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked Ambassador

                        intolerable.</p>

                    <p>DELIVERY OF U.S. MESSAGE</p>
                    <p>With regard to the means of delivering the message to Yahya, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> felt that he should give
                        it to Yahya (rather than <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>) since
                        he could use this to build up credence with Yahya. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> also suggested that this could be
                        used as a lever to get some things done which he has been pressing for in
                        East Pakistan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed
                        out that the two were separate, and must be kept that way. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that in any event the
                        message would be shown to Hilaly and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> would get a copy to discuss with Yahya. All
                        technical coordination will be done through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>—who should discuss with Yahya Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s around-the-world
                        trip, his intention to stop in Pakistan for the weekend and then go on
                        (presumably) to Tehran after leaving Pakistan. A one-day official program in
                        Pakistan would probably have to be planned. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> should discuss with Yahya the fact
                        that he met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        also discuss the technical arrangements of the visit.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> asked that the Navy
                        attache contact him as soon as the channel is open, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> assured him this would be
                        done—probably by Monday.</p>
                    <p>Scenario for China Visit</p>
                    <p>A number of details were then discussed without any definite decisions being
                        made:</p>
                    <p>— Whether to fly to China using a Pakistani, Chinese or U.S. aircraft.</p>
                    <p>— Whether to employ a second U.S. plane (possibly a Jetstar) for the flight
                        into China in order to leave the larger aircraft parked conspicuously at
                        Rawalpindi.</p>
                    <p>— Whether or not Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName>
                        should accompany Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> into
                        China.</p>
                    <p>— Whether to fly into China from Rawalpindi or Sargoda.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> pointed out that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be least likely
                        to be observed in Sargoda, a military base 45 minutes south of Rawalpindi.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> might initially land
                        there on the pretext of <pb n="10" xml:id="d6-10" facs="d6-10"/>visiting the
                        surrounding countryside. After his large plane had left for Rawalpindi to
                        refuel, he could transfer to a smaller plane which would take his party to
                        China and return him to Rawalpindi the following day. The problem with this
                        plan would be that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        could not normally visit a defense installation like Sargoda without
                        arousing suspicion.</p>
                    <p>The final determination with regard to technical details was left in the
                        hands of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJS1">Farland</persName> who
                        indicated he would submit several well-developed alternatives to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for review.</p>
                    <p>After a few parting remarks, the meeting was concluded at 5:45 p.m.</p>

                    <p>1. Conversations were the most intense, important, and far reaching of my
                        White House experience.</p>
                    <p>Principal host spent 17 hours with us, his associates another four, the
                        latter mostly devoted to communique drafting.</p>
                    <p>2. Other side first suggested meeting next summer, then fell back to Spring,
                        finally settled on formulation of “before May 1972” which they interpret as
                        from December onward. It is obvious they are planning a big welcome. All
                        technical issues, including size of press corps and prior political visits,
                        settled as President wished. Agreed time for joint announcement which I am
                        bringing back with me is 2230 July 15, D.C. time. They were insistent on
                        mentioning site and cast of weekend meeting.</p>
                    <p>3. Talks on other subjects including one of particular concern very
                        encouraging but too sensitive for cable. Will write report on plane.</p>
                    <p>4. Please inform President that I strongly urge no further dissemination even
                        to guest until I return. Just say I thought matter too sensitive for
                        cable.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d7-02" facs="d7-02"/>
                    <p>5. Please keep everyone steady. Other side made special point about need to
                        keep word meticulously. They will not understand even a minor leak and will
                        consider it deliberate affront and proof of unreliability. Please keep P.R.
                        types ignorant. A leak or even a hint is almost certain to blow everything.
                        I cannot be too strong on this.</p>

                    <p>Introduction</p>
                    <p>My two-day visit to Peking resulted in the most searching, sweeping and
                        significant discussions I have ever had in government. I spent seventeen
                        hours in meetings and informal conversation with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, flanked by <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal
                            Yeh Chien-ying</persName>, member of the Politburo and of the Military
                        Commission; <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName>, the new Chinese
                        Ambassador in Ottawa; and <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang
                            Wen-chin</persName>, head of the West European and American Department
                        in the Foreign Ministry. Another four hours was spent with
                            <persName>Huang</persName> and <persName>Chang</persName>, mostly on
                        drafting a communique. These meetings brought about a summit meeting between
                        you and <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-Tung</persName>, covered all
                        major issues between our two countries at considerable length and with great
                        candor, and may well have marked a major new departure in international
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>It is extremely difficult to capture in a memorandum the essence of this
                        experience. Simply giving you a straightforward account of the highlights of
                        our talks, potentially momentous as they were, would do violence to an event
                        so shaped by the atmosphere and the ebb and flow of our encounter, or to the
                        Chinese behavior, so dependent on nuances and style. Thus, this memorandum
                        will sketch the overall sequence of events and philosophic framework, as
                        well as the substance of our exchanges. For the intangibles are crucial and
                        we must understand them if we are to take advantage of the opportunities we
                        now have, deal effectively with these tough, idealistic, fanatical,
                        single-minded and remarkable people, and thus transform the very framework
                        of global relationships.</p>
                    <p>What Happened</p>
                    <p>The Chinese treated the entire visit with elaborate correctness and courtesy.
                        They were extremely tough on substance and ideological in their approach,
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d9-02" facs="d9-02"/>but their dealings were
                        meticulous; they concentrated on essentials; they eschewed invective and
                        haggling over details. The atmosphere on the human plane was relaxed and
                        cordial, matter-of-factly; (one did not have the sense that they were
                        carrying out instructions to be cordial as is often the case with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>Thus Chinese hospitality started in Pakistan as we boarded the Pakistani
                        plane in pre-dawn obscurity to be greeted by four senior Chinese officials,
                        headed by <persName>Chang</persName>, flown up from Peking two days earlier
                        along with three Chinese navigators (they had insisted on boarding the plane
                        half an hour before us). And it continued right through to our return flight
                        to Islamabad two days later with all the Chinese officials (except <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>) at the airport and the plane loaded
                        with one last round of Chinese dishes, the latest English version of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s works, and photo albums of
                        our visit prepared throughout the night.</p>
                    <p>We were met at noon at the Peking airport by the very senior <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName> who, like
                            <persName>Chang</persName> aboard the plane, sought to confirm that you
                        were in principle prepared to visit their, country and that I was there for
                        constructive talks between equals. Both were worried about why I had come
                        secretly (Yahya had told me the same thing). Was I ashamed to acknowledge
                        meeting them? Here, and in <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        specific references on several occasions, the Chinese showed extreme
                        sensitivity to slights such as Dulles' refusal to shake <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s hand in Geneva in 1954.</p>
                    <p>We were whisked in Chinese-built limousines, curtains drawn, through wide,
                        clean streets, with little traffic except bicyles. We passed through the
                        huge Tiennmen Square, capable of holding 500,000 people, to a stately,
                        serene, totally secluded government guest house in the Western section of
                        the capital. After drinking tea with our Chinese hosts, we rested, consumed
                        the first of a series of Chinese meals of staggering variety and quantity,
                        and prepared for <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s arrival.</p>
                    <p>He came at 4:30 p.m. At our first encounter like the entire visit, he was
                        matter of fact, urbane, and totally at ease without any of the
                        self-conscious sense of hierarchy of Soviet officials. After a few minutes
                        of ice-breaking small talk and an official photograph, we moved to a
                        conference table and launched into three hours and twenty minutes of
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>I gave the substance of the opening statement you had approved, considerably
                        truncated to get to the point quickly, laying out a possible agenda which we
                        in fact took up point-by-point in our meetings—the summit, Taiwan, <pb n="3" xml:id="d9-03" facs="d9-03"/>Indochina, relations with major countries
                        such as Japan and the Soviet Union, South Asia, future American-Chinese
                        communications, arms control, and any other topics of interest to the
                        Chinese. He immediately moved to their fundamental concern, Taiwan, and I
                        rejoined with our position on Indochina.</p>
                    <p>We broke at 8:00 p.m. for dinner, continuing a low-keyed substantive
                        discussion. Indochina came up again as we finished off the last few of the
                        fifteen or so dishes.</p>
                    <p>Our resumed session from 9:50 to 11:20 p.m. was dominated by the subject of
                        great power relations in general. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        spoke of the Chinese fear of a remilitarized Japan, and violently and
                        contemptuously attacked Soviet imperialism which he claimed had learned its
                        lessons from the U. S. I explained the philosophical framework of U.S.
                        foreign policy in the postwar period culminating in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> listened raptly, asking very probing but
                        non-contentious questions, some based on the President's remarks in Kansas
                        City of July 6. (It was characteristic of <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> that when I indicated that I had seen only press
                        reports, I found <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s own annotated
                        copy of the text waiting for me at breakfast with a request to return it
                        since it was the only copy he had.)</p>
                    <p>On Saturday morning, July 10, we were taken to the Forbidden City, where the
                        entire, enormous Imperial Palace grounds had been closed off from the public
                        for a half day so that we could take a secret tour. For two and a half hours
                        we absorbed the magnificently simple and proportionate sweeps of the red and
                        gold buildings, the courtyards each with its own character, and the living
                        quarters of past emperors. The Director of all of China's archeological
                        museums guided us past ancient relics of China that had been unearthed in
                        recent years.</p>
                    <p>We then proceeded to the Great Hall of the People where we were greeted by
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> for another four and a half
                        hours of discussions sandwiched around a one and a half hour roast duck
                        lunch.</p>
                    <p>Before lunch <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made a one and a half
                        hour presentation, as always without notes, responding to each of the seven
                        points on my original agenda. This was an extremely tough presentation,
                        though put forward without rhetorical flourish—the preoccupation with
                        Taiwan; the support for the North Vietnamese; the spectre of big power
                        collusion, specifically of being carved up by the U.S., <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and Japan; the contempt of the Indians,
                        hatred for the Russians and apprehension over the Japanese; the disclaimer
                        that China is, or would want to be, a superpower like the Russians and we
                        who have “stretched out our hands too far”; and throughout, the constant
                        view <pb n="4" xml:id="d9-04" facs="d9-04"/>that the world must move toward
                        peace, that there is too “much turmoil under the heavens.” There were light
                        touches as well, such as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        revelation that James Reston was taking a slow train from the border which
                        would conveniently get him to Peking right after our departure. Still,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> ended with a
                        challenge—whether there was any sense in a high-level meeting given our vast
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>I responded very toughly, pointing out that they had raised the issue of a
                        Presidential visit and that we could not accept any conditions. I would not
                        raise the issue again; they had to decide whether to issue an invitation. I
                        then launched into a deliberately brusque point-by-point rebuttal of
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s presentation. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> stopped me after the first point,
                        saying the duck would get cold if we did not eat first.</p>
                    <p>At lunch the mood changed and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        geniality returned. I gathered the impression that his speech had been
                        largely for the record.</p>
                    <p>At the end of lunch <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> launched into
                        a moving account of the Cultural Revolution which he continued to relate
                        even after I noted that this was China's internal affair. One could tell
                        that the Revolution was an anguishing period for him. He described China as
                        torn between its fear of bureaucracy and the excesses of revolution, with
                        each side claiming to speak for <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        until the acknowledged excesses threatened to destroy the fruits of some
                        fifty years of struggle.</p>
                    <p>After lunch I continued my comments on his remarks, having covered Taiwan and
                        Japan before the break. On Indochina, as on Taiwan, I noted the need for
                        time for a political evolution and I re-emphasized the link between the two
                        questions. After moving through the other issues such as great power
                        relations, South Asia, communications between our governments and arms
                        control, we had laid a sound substantive framework. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, suddenly, matter-of-factly returned to
                        your visit to China. He suggested the summer of 1972, indicating that they
                        would prefer it if you met the Soviet leaders first. He said that they were
                        not afraid of anyone but they were not looking for unnecessary trouble
                        either. I said that a U.S.-Soviet summit had been agreed in principle but I
                        could make no promise and would accept no condition. I also said that a
                        summer summit might look like a political campaign gesture. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> then moved your visit up to the
                        spring.</p>
                    <p>We adjourned at six so <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> could go to
                        another meeting (he normally works from noon to early morning) and agreed to
                        meet four hours later to draft the joint announcement. We returned to the
                        guest house for dinner and <pb n="5" xml:id="d9-05" facs="d9-05"/>an evening
                        of fits and starts, of nighttime strolls and cancelled meetings and a
                        complicated, occasionally painful minuet of communique drafting. This
                        process is described in the section dealing with the summit.</p>
                    <p>The next morning we held a final two hour meeting which wrapped up the
                        summit, the communique, and final substantive comments. In the first forty
                        minutes we reached agreement with <persName>Huang</persName> and
                            <persName>Chang</persName> on the Communique at Tab A. This capped a
                        drafting process that had its quota of tension but was marked by the other
                        side's clear willingness to meet us half way. Our negotiating over the
                        language was free of the pettiness and elbowing that we have experienced
                        with the Russians. And once the basic bargain was struck, the rest of our
                        business flowed comparatively easily.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, who had been waiting nearby—so
                        as to avoid a confrontation over language—suddenly appeared after the
                        announcement was agreed, and we proceeded to settle all the major principles
                        of your visit along the lines you wished.</p>
                    <p>After bidding farewell to <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, we and
                        the other Chinese officials had a final lunch. All tension was gone and
                            <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName>'s normally impassive
                        face was finally creased by smiles. On the way to the airport he recounted
                        some of his experiences—how over forty years ago as a division commander of
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>, he heard of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and his 2000 followers in the mountains and joined them.
                        And as we drove up toward the waiting Pakistani plane he remarked that none
                        of them on the Long March had ever dreamed to see victory in their
                        lifetimes. They had thought their struggle was for future generations.</p>
                    <p>Yet, he said, “here we are and here you are.”</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d9-06" facs="d9-06"/>
                    <p>The Chinese</p>
                    <p>Two qualities in the Chinese came across with particular force during this
                        initial encounter: their inward philosophical tension and their inward
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>For us this episode is, of course, a major new turn in international
                        relations. For the Chinese Communists it is no less than a personal,
                        intellectual, and emotional drama. They have endured fifty years of the Long
                        March, struggle against the Japanese and Kuomintang, the Great Leap Forward,
                        and the Cultural Revolution.</p>
                    <p>Yet here they were, dealing with arch capitalists, while what they call a
                        “war of liberation” was going on at their borders, acting out a drama of
                        philosophic contradictions. The moral ambivalance of this encounter for them
                        was reflected in a certain brooding quality, in the occasional schizophrenia
                        of <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s presentations, in the jagged
                        rHythym in drafting the announcement, and the tales of the Cultural
                        Revolution and the Long March and <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                            Tse-Tung</persName>'s inspirational leadership. This ambivalence showed
                        up also in their request during our Saturday Imperial Palace tour for an
                        oral summary statement to be made on tape by both sides the final day. I
                        suggested this idea be shelved until we had finished our discussions and
                        they confirmed it would be for internal use only. When <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> arrived at the guest house late that
                        evening he said that they no longer considered the tape necessary. I suspect
                        they wanted the tape for <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                        Tse-Tung</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Thus these were men in some anguish. Yet their long history of past suffering
                        gave them an inner confidence that was reflected in a certain largeness of
                        spirit. There was none of the Russian ploymanship, scoring points, rigidity
                        or bullying. They did not turn everything into a contest. Profoundly
                        committed and firm on principle, they dealt in historical terms; and once we
                        reached basic understandings, such as on the announcement, details fell into
                        place without maneuvering for petty gains.</p>
                    <p>They can be expected to be meticulous in their diplomacy. Indeed they
                        stressed over and over again that they considered meticulous observance of
                        even the spirit of our agreements the key to good future relationships. When
                        I mentioned the fact that the Russians had put out their own, and different,
                        English translation of the May 20 <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>
                        announcement, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> showed obvious
                        contempt and assured me that the Chinese would never resort to such a
                        gambit. Our hosts stressed that the television film and photos of our visit
                        would be held until we agreed to their use.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese are clearly men of deep conviction and a wide chasm of ideology
                        and isolation separates us. But they were nevertheless willing to paint
                        prospects not only of normalizing relations but moving onward to friendship
                        and cooperation.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d9-07" facs="d9-07"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> epitomized these
                        qualities. He spoke with an almost matter of fact clarity and eloquence. He
                        was equally at home in philosophic sweeps, historical analysis, tactical
                        probing, light repartee. His command of facts, and in particular his
                        knowledge of American events, was remarkable. He insisted on admitting
                        faults in their society, and protesting that their lavish hospitality was
                        only “what they should do.”</p>
                    <p>There was little wasted motion, either in his words or his movements. Both
                        reflected the brooding inner tension of a man concerned both with the
                        revolutionary fire of the next generation and the massive daily problem of
                        caring for 750 million people, one who endured the tribulations of the Long
                        March and was now inviting the President of the United States to visit his
                        capital.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was also genial and urbane, with
                        a refreshing sense of humor. He displayed an easy egalitarianism—with his
                        interpreters who had a free though respectful relationship with him, or with
                        all of our party who he consistently ushered into and out of elevators in
                        front of him. And he was considerate in his genuine concern when one of my
                        colleagues wasn't feeling well, in briefing me just before my departure of
                        events in the world from which I had been insulated, and in making sure that
                        we would continue to use the Yahya channel occasionally because “one should
                        not burn bridges that have been useful.”</p>
                    <p>In short, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> ranks with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles De Gaulle</persName> as the most
                        impressive foreign statesman I have met.</p>
                    <p>Of course, these people were on their best behavior. These were the cream of
                        their current elite; and it is inconceivable that the next generation there
                        will produce leaders tempered by such experiences. Almost all of the
                        positive qualities we saw are Chinese, not communist, and can be found in
                        Taiwan or Singapore or San Francisco. Much of their ideology is distasteful,
                        and living in China today would be a numbing, depressing experience. They
                        are certainly fanatically tough. They do not wish us well. Their new society
                        has been purchased at a terrible cost—in freedom, spontaneity, color, and
                        family life. But the present generation of leaders understand big
                        conceptions. Our dealings will be difficult, especially as we inaugurate a
                        brand new relationship. The rewards and risks will be great. But if we keep
                        our nerve and are clear about our purposes we can start a new historical
                        course.</p>

                    <p>Summit</p>
                    <p>The summit emerged as the cause of a major Chinese ambivalence. Even before
                        the meetings started the Chinese were anxious to get confirmation that you
                        were in principle willing to go to China. On the other hand they pretended
                        that they had responded to your request. On substance <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> took an initially hard position that
                        the summit should be in the context of improving Sino-U.S. relations and
                        that the best way to accomplish this was by the establishment of diplomatic
                        relations. He eventually backed away—only after considerable give-and-take
                        by reluctantly acknowledging that recognition was not an “absolute”
                        precondition for a summit, though this direction should be set by it.</p>
                    <p>This was in the earlier stages of our talks. Later on, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> again toughened his position by stating
                        that the initiative for a summit had come from you and not from the Chinese.
                        I referred to the actual messages, which I had brought with me, but
                        suggested that if it was so difficult perhaps we should drop the idea of a
                        summit for the time being and go on to substantive matters.</p>
                    <p>By the second day, the Chinese stand again had softened. On the way to our
                        tour of the Forbidden City, Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> referred
                        to <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s interest in a statement on a
                        summit. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> himself raised the
                        subject in our discussions that afternoon and after making no headway with a
                        ploy that a summit should be in a climate of Sino-U.S. friendship to be
                        established by recognition, proposed at about 5:30 in the evening that a
                        drafting committee for a joint summit communique meet that night at about
                        8:30 p.m. He told me that he had another appointment, but would personally
                        appear about 10:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Having gone this far, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was willing
                        to look more deeply into the summit issue. He listened to my thoughts on
                        general principles, and insisted that another high-level meeting between our
                        representatives would be necessary before the summit took place to fix the
                        agenda and details. The U.S. representative, he said, should be either me or
                        someone else of similar stature close to you. I mentioned Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and in his final statement
                        he said that it should be either <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> or I. This time, though, the visit should be an open
                        one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> in addition expressed a desire to
                        have your summit with <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-Tung</persName>
                        take place after any similar meetings with the Soviets. Even though he <pb n="9" xml:id="d9-09" facs="d9-09"/>was willing to be flexible when I
                        explained our problems, this was a significant sign (and perhaps the most
                        significant) of the Chinese worries about their confrontation with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Producing a mutually satisfactory communique proved to be a tense process.
                        Their drafters failed to appear at the stipulated time, and at about 10:45
                        p.m. we were told that they would not arrive before 9:00 the next morning. I
                        had in the meantime been walking in the grounds of the guest house to
                        discuss with my associates the possible reasons for the delay, and I also
                        had made it plain to their protocol people that I had to leave Peking no
                        later than 1:00 p.m. the next day whatever the state of our discussions. I
                        also said that as the President's representative they had to give me a
                        precise meeting time and could not keep me on standby. They must have sensed
                        my irritation, for just as we were going to bed we were informed that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was coming. He arrived at
                        about 11:15, referred to my departure time, apologized for getting us up,
                        and said that his drafters would appear shortly. He departed after an hour's
                        friendly conversation dealing with Taiwan, India, the Berlin issue, and the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I then spent several hours with the Chinese officials going over a draft by
                        their side which would have had the initiative for the visit coming from
                        you, and which would have keyed the summit just to seeking “normalization of
                        relations.” (Tab B). I insisted that the origin of the visit had to be put
                        in terms of mutual interest. They agreed after a while, although there were
                        differences over the exact language. Where they had trouble was over my
                        insistence that the summit meeting should have a broader scope than just the
                        normalization of relations. At about 1:40 a.m., they proposed a 30-minute
                        recess in which they would try to work out language on both points suitable
                        to us, and left the room. We took another brief walk in the grounds and
                        returned to await their arrival; at 3:00 a.m. we learned that they had left
                        the building entirely (they must have gone to <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s office) and would not return until 9:00
                        a.m.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, at 9:40 a.m., on July 11, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and the other officials reappeared. At this point there
                        was some confusion; <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, it seemed,
                        would be strolling outside while the others came in to discuss their draft
                        communique with me. Our first word, however, was that all were to come in
                        together, and the Chinese seemed rather embarrassed at the sudden shift in
                        plan. In their new version of the communique they had gone very far to meet
                        my requirements, and their wording needed only a few minor changes to be
                        fully acceptable. The agreed joint communique (Tab A) suggests a mutual
                        desire for the summit with you accepting their invitation, and its purpose
                        has been broadened to “questions of concern to both sides.”</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d9-10" facs="d9-10"/>
                    <p>With agreement reached on the communique, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> quickly appeared. Presumably for “face” reasons, he had
                        not been prepared to present himself unless or until there was such an
                        agreement. Once in the meeting, he accepted easily all the details for the
                        summit which I then put forward. He made the point that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> had personally endorsed the summit
                        meeting, and accepted my proposed date and time for the public release of
                        the joint communique, even though “this may cause us a little trouble.”</p>
                    <p>I can only account for the fits and starts in the drafting of the joint
                        communique by attributing them to a deep conflict between ideological and
                        practical considerations on the Chinese side. Ideologically, the concept of
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> sitting down with the
                        leader of what they call the “imperialist camp” must be extremely difficult
                        for some Chinese to accept, despite the prospect of its moving forward their
                        campaign against Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I believe they are deeply worried about the Soviet threat
                        to their national integrity, realistically speaking, and see in us a
                        balancing force against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. And,
                        unlikely as it may superficially seem, I sense that they actually do
                        appreciate the balancing role we play in Asia. Nevertheless, it is hard for
                        life-long revolutionaries to act against their own principles, and we must
                        be exceptionally careful not to drive them away.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese will undoubtedly stress the Taiwan issue as the key to
                        normalization of relations, but we can maintain that all issues of mutual
                        concern will be discussed for the sake of Asian and world peace. On all
                        other issues <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> in effect left all
                        the other basic principles up to you, giving us precisely what you
                        wished:</p>
                    <p>— A visit of up to five days.</p>
                    <p>— Probably one other city besides Peking. (He mentioned Mao might be outside
                        the capital for more quiet talks with you.)</p>
                    <p>— Small official delegation, to include Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, myself and a couple of aides.</p>
                    <p>— Agenda will probably look somewhat like the one <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and I had, with this subject to be pursued by <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and/or me.</p>
                    <p>— Small press delegation; he said this could mean around ten. They will
                        establish the ground rules after we tell them what they should be.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d9-11" facs="d9-11"/>
                    <p>— Minimum secret service; I really don't think security will be any problem.
                        They said security is the responsibility of the host country.</p>
                    <p>— The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> will not invite other U.S.
                        political leaders before your visit. I emphasized that it was important that
                        our new departure in relations start at your level and not be muddied by
                        eager politicians in advance. This would not rule out newsmen and cultural
                        exchanges in the interim.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d9-12" facs="d9-12"/>
                    <p>Taiwan</p>
                    <p>This was described by <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> as the basic
                        issue between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, going
                        back to the Korean war, when we “surrounded” Taiwan and declared—in contrast
                        to our previous position—that its status was “undetermined.” <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> maintained that this was still our
                        position, citing as a case in point a recent statement by the State
                        Department press spokesman to the effect that Taiwan status was legally
                        undetermined. (You will recall that you took considerable exception to this
                        statement.) I emphasized that they might have noted that the remarks by the
                        press spokesman had not been repeated. There was considerable laughter on
                        the Chinese side over this, and frequent later references. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> asked whether we could apply the same
                        method to <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s comments about
                        nuclear weapons for Japan. I am sure that they were already aware that you
                        had clamped down but wanted confirmation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> then went on to say that to
                        establish diplomatic relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>,
                        the U.S. must:</p>
                    <p>— Recognize that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and a province of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>— Recognize the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> as the sole legitimate
                        government of China.</p>
                    <p>— Withdraw all its armed forces and military installations from the area of
                        Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait within a limited period.</p>
                    <p>— Consider that the U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> Mutual Defense
                        Treaty is invalid.</p>
                    <p>I responded that the Chinese were going beyond what they had said to us in
                        their messages and in the two 1970 Warsaw talks, in which they had requested
                        the removal of our military presence only. I said that we had to distinguish
                        between what could be done immediately and what had to be left to historical
                        evolution. With respect to military presence there were two components to
                        our forces on Taiwan—those related to the defense of Southeast Asia,
                        especially Vietnam, and those related to the defense of Taiwan. The former
                        could be withdrawn after the end of the war in Vietnam; the latter would
                        depend on the general state of our relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> asked whether I was linking the
                        Taiwan issue to Indochina. When I affirmed it he did not demur but turned to
                        a discussion of Indochina, pointing out only that it was easier for the
                        Chinese who were not at war to take a long view than for the Vietnamese.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d9-13" facs="d9-13"/>
                    <p>On the political future of Taiwan, I said we did not advocate a “two Chinas”
                        or a “one China - one Taiwan” solution but would accept any political
                        evolution agreed to by the parties. We hoped that this evolution would be
                        peaceful, and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would try to keep it so.</p>
                    <p>I said that we could not accept recognition as a condition to your visit to
                        Peking. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, after much give and
                        take, said that recognition was not a precondition but that the visit should
                        set recognition as the ultimate direction of pur policy. He accepted my
                        position that some time would be required, i.e., well into your second
                        term.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said that if China was to be
                        patient it needed three assurances: first, that the U.S. would not support
                        “two Chinas” or a “one China, one Taiwan” policy; second, that we would not
                        support the indigenous Taiwan independence movement; and third, that we
                        would not permit Japanese troops to move in. I stressed that this would be
                        our policy but noted that some events on Taiwan might be beyond our ability
                        to control. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> interposed no
                        objection.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I said we might support a
                        position where the admission of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        would be by a majority vote, but the expulsion of other countries,i.e.,
                        Taiwan, would be by a 2/3 vote with the Chinese Security Council seat going
                        to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. As soon as the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> gained the necessary 2/3, it would be
                        China's sole representative in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> did not regard getting into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a particularly urgent matter. It had lived
                        without the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for 21 years, and could
                        continue to do so. However, if others asked, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would of course maintain its stand that its legitimate
                        rights in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must be restored. China
                        would have to oppose the U.S. position which I had described. When I
                        suggested that he mute the rhetoric, he agreed smilingly. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> added that our proposed stand would
                        cause more difficulty to us than to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.
                        He did not take undue exception to it as long as we would not put it forward
                        ourselves, but would simply support it if proposed by others.
                        (Significantly, discussion of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issue
                        came well before agreement on the summit and the joint communique, showing
                        that the one was not an obstacle to the other.)</p>
                    <p>As a final point on Taiwan, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> noted
                        that the agreement on your meeting with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> would “shake the world.” Afterwards, <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> might collude with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Japan, and would demonstrate
                        against you. <persName>Chiang</persName> would try to operate independently
                        of the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> knew this from his
                        previous associations with <persName>Chiang</persName>, and the U.S. “should
                        beware.”</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d9-14" facs="d9-14"/>
                    <p>Indochina</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> was as forthcoming as we
                        could have hoped. His attitude throughout reflected the ambivalance of
                        Peking's position. For ideological reasons, he clearly had to support Hanoi.
                        On the other hand, it was apparent that he did not wish to jeopardize the
                        chances for an improvement in our relations, especially after I explained
                        the positions we had taken in Paris and warned of the danger of escalation
                        if negotiations failed. He came back to this latter point again and again,
                        without threat or bluster, simply using it as an argument for the
                        desirability of peace.</p>
                    <p>Thus <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> went back and forth between a
                        formal theoretical defense of Hanoi's position (though in much lower key
                        than <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> at Paris) and
                        concrete questions that sought to discover areas of agreement. He stressed
                        Peking's support of Hanoi while insisting that there had not been advisers
                        in Indochina nor would there be. He critized American aggression but
                        stressed Chinese interest in an “honorable exit” for the U.S.</p>
                    <p>From the outset, I linked the Indochina conflict and our relations with
                        Peking:</p>
                    <p>— I pointed out that two-thirds of our forces in Taiwan were linked to the
                        war and their removal would depend on an end of the conflict.</p>
                    <p>— I also pointed out that an end to the war would accelerate the improvement
                        in our relationship.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I reviewed the current situation in Paris and pointed out that
                        the talks were blocked because of Hanoi's insistence on the overthrow of
                        Thieu and its refusal to agree to a ceasefire. I warned that a breakdown in
                        the negotiations would mean continuation of the war, with incalculable
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> addressed Indochina several times
                        during the first two days of our talks.</p>
                    <p>On the first day he asked a number of questions about our position, generally
                        in an intelligent and sympathetic manner. These were:</p>
                    <p>— Were we really ready to pull out?</p>
                    <p>— Would we close all our bases?</p>
                    <p>— Why would we wish to leave a “tail,” such as some advisers and/or the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> Government?</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d9-15" facs="d9-15"/>
                    <p>— Would we be prepared to accept having the Indochinese people determine
                        their own future?</p>
                    <p>— Why did we wish a cease-fire?</p>
                    <p>— Would we wish to continue giving aid to the present government?</p>
                    <p>It was clear that he understood the linkage between Taiwan and Vietnam and
                        did not object to it. He also was extremely concerned about the possibility
                        of escalation. In addition, he made the following points:</p>
                    <p>— He revealed that he had not been informed about the secret meetings we have
                        had with the North Vietnamese in Paris recently.</p>
                    <p>— He said that China only had two objectives with regard to a Vietnam
                        settlement:</p>
                    <p>- There must be a withdrawal of U.S. and Allied forces.</p>
                    <p>- The peoples of the three Indochinese countries must be left to decide their
                        own future.</p>
                    <p>— He insisted that China would keep hands off after a settlement.</p>
                    <p>On the second day <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> took a harder
                        line. As part of a generally tough presentation, he attacked the <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and Lon Nol Governments and he
                        charged us with having committed “aggression” in Indochina since World War
                        II. He warned that we should pull out completely and not leave a “tail”
                        behind in the form of advisers since these would be the entering wedge for a
                        new involvement.</p>
                    <p>He warned about the dangers of escalation but also made clear that China
                        would not intervene. He explained several times that Chinese assistance to
                        Hanoi had never included combat forces—there had only been some
                        bridgebuilding and road repair crews during the bombing.</p>
                    <p>He stressed that there were no Chinese advisors in Indochina nor would there
                        be.</p>
                    <p>The morning of our departure, without prompting, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> returned to Indochina in an astonishingly sympathetic
                        and open manner. He made the following points:</p>
                    <p>— He hoped our negotiations in Paris would be successful and he wished me
                        luck.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d9-16" facs="d9-16"/>
                    <p>— He would talk to Hanoi after the announcement of the. President's visit to
                        Peking had been made.</p>
                    <p>— Peking supports Mme. Binh's seven point proposal but they were
                        negotiable.</p>
                    <p>— He hopes our withdrawal will be complete, thorough and honorable.</p>
                    <p>— He thought that we would find Hanoi more generous than we believed.</p>
                    <p>This means he will talk to the North Vietnamese and may be able to exert some
                        influence. The mere fact of his talking to them is likely to compound the
                        shock of your announced visit to Peking. In any case, he knows that the very
                        fact that we and Peking are moving closer will have an impact in Hanoi.</p>

                    <p>Japan</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> repeatedly expressed concern
                        about the revival of Japanese militarism, and I have no doubt that the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> relationship with Japan is in fact a
                        serious matter for the Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        maintained that the rapid development of Japanese economic power would
                        inevitably carry rearmament in its wake. In this, he said that Japan's
                        economic expansion would lead to political expansionism. He pointed to the
                        great budgetary increase of Japan's Fourth Defense Plan over its
                        predecessors as a case in point. He quoted Sato as mentioning that Japan's
                        rapid economic growth would permit this plan to be completed in two to three
                        years rather than the five originally contemplated.</p>
                    <p>He noted also that <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> had now spoken
                        of the defense of Taiwan, Okinawa, and Korea being essential to the defense
                        of Japan, and took <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s mention of
                        this in our 1969 Joint Communique with him as an indication that the U.S.
                        was supporting Japan's rearmament. Japanese troops might even go to Taiwan.
                        At one point he mentioned the possibility of Japan colluding with the U.S.
                        and the USSR to carve up China, and cited Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s speech in Japan as a sign of U.S.
                        interest in Japan's developing nuclear weapons. He doubted that the return
                        of Okinawa would be without nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> plainly was holding us responsible for trends in
                        Japanese policy which appeared to threaten China.</p>
                    <p>I declared flatly that we were not encouraging, and indeed opposed, any
                        revival of Japanese expansionism. I agreed on the military implications of
                        Japan's economic growth and said that the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> interests coincided in trying to keep this growth under
                        control. All the U.S. supported was Japan's ability to defend itself.
                        Paradoxically, the presence of U.S. troops on Japan helped to restrain the
                        Japanese rather than the reverse. We would never collude with other
                        countries in carving China up.</p>
                    <p>I strongly denied that what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> had allegedly said was Administration policy, and
                        pointed out that once Okinawa reverted to Japan our bases would be under the
                        same restrictions as now exist for those in Japan. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> accepted this, and later personally
                        called attention to the State Department spokesman's comments on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s speech.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> had started off with a
                        very rigid position on Japan, I believe that he understands the restraining
                        role which we play with respect to the Japanese. This came through toward
                        the end of our meetings, when he asked that we see to it that, as U.S.
                        troops are withdrawn from Taiwan, Japanese troops are not moved in to
                        replace them. I said that this would be done.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="d9-18" facs="d9-18"/>
                    <p>Korea</p>
                    <p>Korea was cited by <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> as another area
                        of “turmoil under heaven.” This arose first from the fact that there was no
                        peace treaty there despite China's efforts in 1954 to extend the Geneva
                        Agreements to Korea. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> had proposed
                        this to get something better than a ceasefire in Korea, and Anthony Eden, in
                        the chair, had gone along until Walter Bedell Smith had “waved his arms” and
                        caused <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> to reject the move on
                        procedural grounds. Presumably, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        was suggesting that China wanted an arrangement in Korea which had legal
                        status.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> went on to say that there was
                        constant conflict along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>; U.S. forces
                        were still present; and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops were in
                        Vietnam. There was now a joint U. S.-South Korean army in which Thailand was
                        also represented. <persName corresp="#p_PCH2">Park Chong-Hee</persName> was
                        as aggressive as Syngman Rhee. Therefore, the DPRK—and China—had a right to
                        be concerned.</p>
                    <p>I said that what happened in Korea depended very much on the general
                        relationships in the area. If the war in Indochina ended and U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> relations developed, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in Vietnam would return, and it was
                        conceivable that before the end of your next term most of the U.S. troops in
                        Korea would be withdrawn. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> himself
                        suggested that in those terms the process had already begun with our removal
                        of 20,000 men, and I agreed. On <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s
                        other points, I said I knew of no Thai troops in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. The joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                        military command was not a new policy; it was intended to make our
                        withdrawal easier and was not a new commitment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s remarks on alleged <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> aggressiveness gave me an opportunity to
                        highlight North Korean actions. I said that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was opposed to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                        aggression against the North Koreans, but North Korea for its part was very
                        harsh in its military meassures against both the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. We believed it would be very helpful to
                        Asian peace if the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> could restrain North
                        Korea in the use of force against the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> did not reply,
                        but I think that his silence may be taken as a form of assent—he could
                        hardly admit that an ally of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was
                        behaving aggressively.</p>

                    <p>South Asia</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> described the South Asian
                        subcontinent as a prime area of “turmoil under heaven.” This was because
                        India had long ago under <persName corresp="#p_NJ3">Nehru</persName> adopted
                        an expansionist philosophy, not only committing aggression against Pakistan
                        but against China as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> went into great detail to outline
                        the development of the hostile relationship between China and India. This
                        began, he said, when the Indians became aware in 1959 that the Chinese had
                        built a road across Indian-claimed territory between Sinkiang and the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Ali</persName> region of Tibet—but how could
                        this have been Indian territory when the Indians weren't even aware when the
                        road was built?</p>
                    <p>The Indians had then attacked a Chinese military post in this region, but had
                        lost heavily because the Chinese position was uphill from where the Indians
                        were and was strongly fortified. But world opinion (including Khrushchev)
                        felt that the Chinese must have started hostilities because of the heavy
                        Indian losses. The Indians had also used force against the Chinese in other
                        areas. The culmination was the Sino-Indian war of 1962.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made the following points:</p>
                    <p>— India was responsible for the present turmoil in East Pakistan. It was
                        supporting Bangla Desh and had allowed a Bangla Desh “headquarters” to be
                        set up on Indian territory.</p>
                    <p>— In the light of Indian expansionist ambitions, India would use any military
                        aid—such as that given by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—for
                        aggressive purposes. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> acknowledged
                        that we were not giving military assistance to India, but said that one had
                        to keep the consequences of any aid in mind.</p>
                    <p>— China would stand by Pakistan in the present crisis. This position began to
                        develop with a rather low-key remark at dinner the first night that China
                        “could not but take some interest in the situation,” and ended with a
                        request to me at the end to convey assurances of Chinese support to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">Yahya Khan</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> that we were trying very
                        hard to discourage an Indo-Pak war.</p>
                    <p>I assured <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> that we were bringing
                        all the influence we could to bear on India to try to prevent a war from
                        developing. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said that this was a
                        good thing, but he inferred that we might not be able to do too much because
                        we <pb n="20" xml:id="d9-20" facs="d9-20"/>were 10,000 miles away. China,
                        however, was much closer. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        recalled the Chinese defeat of India in 1962 and hinted rather broadly that
                        the same thing could happen again.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese detestation of the Indians came through loud and clear.
                        Conversely, China's warm friendship for Pakistan as a firm and reliable
                        friend was made very plain. The lesson that <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> may have been trying to make here was that those who
                        stand by China and keep their word will be treated in kind.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d9-21" facs="d9-21"/>
                    <p>Communications</p>
                    <p>I explained that it was essential for our two governments to be able to
                        communicate rapidly, reliably and secretly—without the intervention of third
                        parties, however friendly. This had two aspects—how to get in touch with
                        each other and whom to deal with in the government. I suggested three levels
                        of contact:</p>
                    <p>— A hot line between Washington and Peking for urgent messages.</p>
                    <p>— A secure direct channel between the Chinese leaders and yourself which
                        would not be vulnerable to the bureaucracies or developments in a third
                        country. This would be used for important and sensitive matters, to agree on
                        basic principles and to clarify misunderstandings. It would be kept free of
                        the bureaucracy to prevent both leaks and formalism. I mentioned Paris,
                        London or Ottawa as possible contact points.</p>
                    <p>— A diplomatic contact such as Warsaw for more technical issues and
                        implementation of agreements reached through the secure channel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s first reaction was rather cool,
                        with a suggestion that it might be premature. On the second day <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> returned to the subject to say that he
                        would let me know the next morning at our final session.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday morning he never mentioned the hot line proposal and stated that
                        revival of the Warsaw Talks would be a waste of time. They took more of
                        everybody's effort in preparing instructions then they were worth. He agreed
                        that we did need a secure White House/Peking channel and chose the Chinese
                        embassy in Paris, saying that their Ambassador there was a member of the
                        Central Committee and that Ottawa would be too much in the limelight. I said
                        that General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> would be our
                        contact in Paris and would be in touch on July 19. We shall communicate
                        either by sealed envelopes or through messages to be transmitted by their
                        Ambassador. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> added that we should
                        continue to pass some non-substantive notes through President Yahya who had
                        been a good friend.</p>

                    <p>Great Power Relations</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> professed apprehension over the
                        possibility that the U.S., <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Japan and
                        even India might collaborate to carve up China. He showed deep bitterness
                        against the Soviets and contempt for their petty tactics. The Soviets, he
                        said, were proceeding down the U.S. road in “spreading their hands out too
                        far.” While he was confident they would be ultimately defeated, he inferred
                        that difficult times might be expected before this came about. Fear of
                        revived Japanese militarism was a major theme throughout our discussions.
                        Japan's economic growth was to him equated with expansionism, and he felt
                        that rearmament to back it was already taking place. In addition, China's
                        historical distrust of the Indians came through strongly.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized that the U.S. would never collude with other powers against
                        China and that this would be shortsighted since the U.S. and China had no
                        real conflicting interests. Indeed, in the area of relations among large
                        countries our interests were very comparable. With respect to Japan, we were
                        interested in its having the ability to defend itself, but would oppose
                        Japanese militarism. While the objective consequences of U.S. actions might
                        sometimes look like collusion, we would strive consciously to avoid this. I
                        assured <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> on the following:</p>
                    <p>— that you were prepared to inform them in advance of major decisions we have
                        with other great powers that might affect them.</p>
                    <p>— that you would take their views into account.</p>
                    <p>— that we would consult on items of interest to them and try to reflect their
                        concerns. I offered to explain to him our approach on other negotiations we
                        were conducting, such as <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>. Except for a
                        general question on Berlin issues, he did not take this suggestion up.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> several times emphasized that
                        China lacked the economic base to be considered a great power, but had no
                        desire to be considered one, and indeed wished to avoid the kind of great
                        power rivalry existing between the Soviet Union and the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> alleged that even after China's economy
                        became developed it would still not act as a great power. The Chinese
                        clearly like to picture themselves as free from the vice of great power
                        ambitions which have only served to stir turmoil in the world and brought
                        problems for the <pb n="23" xml:id="d9-23" facs="d9-23"/>powers themselves.
                        They prefer to be cast in the role of championing the less powerful and
                        fortunate countries of the world. Their attitude toward great powers now is
                        a mix of hostility, suspicions and fear. This may be rather disingenuous,
                        however, for while they profess not to envy those who are undisputably great
                        powers, they may be making a virtue out of a necessity. And their very
                        interest in a U.S.-Chinese summit has them playing a great power game.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="d9-24" facs="d9-24"/>
                    <p>Arms Control</p>
                    <p>I asked for their views on the Soviet proposal on a five power nuclear
                        conference, reminding him that you had held up our response so as to get
                        Chinese views. They flatly rejected the idea as a Soviet attempt to lasso
                        them. I said we would be slow in our response; that other countries'
                        pressures might force us to go along; and that if such a conference were
                        held we would seek to make sure that China was not put at a disadvantage. On
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> I assured them we would conclude
                        no agreement directed against them, and that we recognized that limiting
                        their embryonic strategic program at this time would be discriminatory. I
                        said we were willing to discuss accidental war agreements with them such as
                        we were discussing with the Russians; <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> replied that we could raise this with them whenever we
                        wished. I added that we were prepared to consider a renunciation of force
                        agreement such as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> had proposed in
                        1955. He responded in low key that Taiwan was linked to this issue and
                        immediately went on to say he hoped my Paris Talks with the North Vietnamese
                        would bear fruit.</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="d9-25" facs="d9-25"/>
                    <p>Americans Detained in China</p>
                    <p>At the very end I said that we would be grateful for a pardon of all or some
                        of the four Americans still held in China when the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> thought conditions were ripe. We were not making a request
                        and recognized it was China's matter to decide, but we would consider their
                        release a voluntary act of mercy. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        said that their law allowed shortened sentences for good behavior and they
                        Would continue to study the matter. (This could well mean they might make a
                        gesture.)</p>

                    <p>Conclusion</p>
                    <p>I am frank to say that this visit was a very moving experience. The historic
                        aspects of the occasion; the warmth and dignity of the Chinese; the splendor
                        of the Forbidden City, Chinese history and culture; the heroic stature of
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>; and the intensity and
                        sweep of our talks combined to make an indelible impression on me and my
                        colleagues.</p>
                    <p>These forty-eight hours, and my extensive discussions with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> in particular, had all the flavor,
                        texture, variety and delicacy of a Chinese banquet. Prepared from the long
                        sweep of tradition and culture, meticulously cooked by hands of experience,
                        and served in splendidly simple surroundings, our feast consisted of many
                        courses, some sweet and some sour, all interrelated and forming a coherent
                        whole. It was a total experience, and one went away, as after all good
                        Chinese meals, very satisfied but not at all satiated.</p>
                    <p>We have laid the groundwork for you and <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> to turn a page in history. But we should have no
                        illusions about the future. Profound differences and years of isolation yawn
                        between us and the Chinese. They will be tough before and during the summit
                        on the question of Taiwan and other major issues. And they will prove
                        implacable foes if our relations turn sour. My assessment of these people is
                        that they are deeply ideological, close to fanatic in the intensity of their
                        beliefs. At the same time they display an inward security that allows them,
                        within the framework of their principles, to be meticulous and reliable in
                        dealing with others.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the process we have now started will send enormous shock waves
                        around the world. It may panic the Soviet Union into sharp hostility. It
                        could shake Japan loose from its heavily American moorings. It will cause a
                        violent upheaval in Taiwan. It will have major impact on our other Asian
                        allies, such as Korea and Thailand. It will increase the already substantial
                        hostility in India. Some quarters may seek to sabotage the summit over the
                        coming months.</p>
                    <p>However, we were well aware of these risks when we embarked on this course.
                        We were aware too that the alternative was unacceptable—continued isolation
                        from one-quarter of the world's most talented people and a country rich in
                        past achievements and future potential.</p>
                    <p>And even the risks can be managed and turned to our advantage if we maintain
                        steady nerves and pursue our policies responsibly. With the <pb n="27" xml:id="d9-27" facs="d9-27"/>Soviet Union we will have to make clear the
                        continued priorities we attach to our concrete negotiations with them. Just
                        as we will not collude with them against China, so we have no intention of
                        colluding with China against them. If carefully managed, our new China
                        policy could have a longer term beneficial impact on Moscow.</p>
                    <p>With Japan our task will be to make clear that we are not shifting our
                        allegiance in Asia from her to China. On Taiwan we can hope for little more
                        than damage limitation by reaffirming our diplomatic relations and mutual
                        defense treaty even while it becomes evident that we foresee a political
                        evolution over the coming years. With our other Asian allies we will need to
                        stress both our continued bonds and our hope that reconciliation between us
                        and the Chinese will serve the cause of regional peace. And in India, after
                        the initial shock, our China moves might produce a more healthy
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>For Asia and for the world we need to demonstrate that we are enlarging the
                        scope of our diplomacy in a way that, far from harming the interests of
                        other countries, should instead prove helpful to them.</p>
                    <p>Our dealings, both with the Chinese and others, will require reliability,
                        precision, finesse. If we can master this process, we will have made a
                        revolution.</p>

                    <p>Dear Dick:</p>
                    <p>Attached you will find two enclosures. The first is a two-page message which
                        is to be handed to the Chinese Ambassador for the promptest transmission to
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. The second is an
                        instruction to you for oral transmission to the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>You will note from both enclosures that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would like to see the Chinese Ambassador on either
                        the 25th or 26th. Hopefully, a meeting could be arranged in the Ambassador's
                        residence before midnight on the 25th. In this case, you might proceed
                        directly to your residence from the airport, drop off luggage and one
                        passenger and proceed directly to the Ambassador's residence. If, however,
                        as you mentioned on the phone, a change will have to be made as to the
                        arrival airfield, a meeting at the residence on the afternoon of the 26th
                        would also be acceptable as a second choice.</p>
                    <p>Concerning this weekend, option 1 or 3 would be acceptable for
                        accommodations. The schedule for the trip includes:</p>
                    <p>Departure from Andrews </p>
                    <p>0830 local, July 25</p>
                    <p>Arrive Rhein Main </p>
                    <p>2050 local</p>
                    <p>Arrive Paris</p>
                    <p>2235 local</p>
                    <p>Since the last discussion was not precise on this issue, you will wish to
                        confirm with the North Vietnamese that the meeting on the 26th should be at
                        1030 local.</p>

                    <p>22 July 1971</p>
                    <p>Dear Al:</p>
                    <p>Herewith the scenario of the latest episode. Today 21 July at 1300 I met the
                        courier with your envelope. After opening and reading it, I telephoned to
                        Tsao Kuei Sheng, 1st Secretary of the-Embassy of <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, to ask when I could see the Ambassador. He suggested 1700
                        this evening and I agreed.</p>
                    <p>At 1700 I drove to the general neighborhood of their Ambassador's residence
                        and leaving my car several blocks away I walked to the residence where I was
                        let in. I was received by Tsao Kuei Sheng and a few minutes later the
                        Ambassador came in. I told him that I had received a message from Kirschman
                        for transmission to the Prime Minister. He took it, passed it to Tsao Kuei
                        Sheng who read it to him in Chinese. Tsao speaks fluent English and Wei Tung
                        fluent French. At the meeting today only the Ambassador the Tsao were
                        present. After hearing the translation he said that he would send this at
                        once to the Prime Minister. He then asked about Kirschman's visit and I
                        replied that he was coming to Paris on Sunday evening late and would like to
                        see the Ambassador either late that night or Monday afternoon. He indicated
                        a preference for the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>He then asked about the verbal message and I told him that Kirschman felt it
                        might not be too early to examine the technical details of the trip referred
                        to in the previous message I had given him for the Prime Minister. He seemed
                        slightly puzzled and said he was not sure what trip was being discussed as
                        there had not been mention in the Peking Conversations of such a trip.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I believed it was the trip by Gen Kirschman and Amb <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> referred to in the previous message.
                        Gen Kirschman would like to know what their thoughts were on the mechanics
                        and I proceeded to give him the questions in a low key. He said initially
                        that where we came from was our problem and he did not see the need for a
                        Chinese navigator, but after talking to Tsao in Chinese, he said that he
                        would pass the question on. Again, on the matter of <pb n="2" xml:id="d11-02" facs="d11-02"/>the participants and duration of the
                        stay, he seemed slightly puzzled. I explained that I thought that we were
                        “thinking out loud” to get their reactions and I would pass on any views of
                        their side. However, as he had asked that if he were to see Gen Kirschman
                        and the latter were to have any questions, he would like to know a few days
                        in advance so he could get instructions on them. He then asked whether Gen
                        Kirschman would expect to have the answers to these questions on Monday. I
                        said that he hoped he might but if they did not arrive in time I was sure
                        that it would be all right for me to transmit them subsequently. He appeared
                        relieved at this and said that he thought that he would have the answers to
                        at least some of the questions by Monday.</p>
                    <p>He commented that these were fairly complicated questions. I said that Gen
                        Kirschman had long been a professor and they liked things neatly arranged.
                        He laughed and said that he and I were soldiers and we liked things neatly
                        arranged too.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that in principle he agreed to see Gen Kirschman on
                        Monday afternoon (providing his government authorized him to do so) and I
                        could call Tsao to fix the exact time. The meeting would be at his residence
                        some ten blocks from my home.</p>
                    <p>I did not indicate to him what was the purpose of Gen Kirschman's visit to
                        Paris and he asked for no details.</p>
                    <p>After several cups of jasmine tea and sweets, he walked me to the door,
                        clapped me on the back and said that with all the languages I knew I should
                        also learn Chinese. He could not have been more cordial throughout.</p>
                    <p>Frankly, I think he was a little taken aback at the speed of our action. His
                        oriental mind is not yet used to the brisk American way of doing business.
                        Time has a different dimension to him than it has to us. However, once he
                        had recovered and had understood that our questions were exploratory in
                        nature and aimed only at getting his government's thinking on these matters,
                        he relaxed visibly. I also believe that he is held on a tight rein by his
                        government and does not enjoy anything like the freedom of action enjoyed by
                        a Western Ambassador. I think he has authority to eat three meals a day,
                        drink unlimited amounts of tea and make whatever visits are necessary to the
                        sanitary facilities and little else. I may, however, be quite wrong in
                        this.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d11-03" facs="d11-03"/>
                    <p>I spoke in English. This was translated by Tsao and when he answered, it was
                        also translated into English. No one else was present. I was with them about
                        45 minutes. The location was at 35 Boulevard du Chateau in Neuilly. The
                        building is a large private home set back in a garden. There is a high wall
                        and iron gate in front but this can be opened and cars driven right up to
                        the entrance of the house. This is a quiet residential neighborhood on a
                        wide tree-lined street.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully,</p>
                    <p>P.S. The sweets are small pieces of preserved apple (quite good) and Lichee
                        nuts which I would eat only in the service of my country.</p>

                        <item>July 26 Meeting with Chinese Ambassador in Paris</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I established contact with the Chinese Ambassador in Paris, <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName>, on the afternoon of Monday, July
                        26, after my other session. (You will recall that <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> designated him as our secret point of contact.)
                        Although he was hospitable and friendly, it was clear that he has little
                        latitude, operates narrowly within instructions, and will serve chiefly as a
                        transmittal belt for messages between us and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. He had just returned from Peking where he was called back
                        after my trip there.</p>
                    <p>In our discussion the Ambassador relayed the following verbal points from the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>— The Chinese government agrees to an interim visit by me in the latter part
                        of October. (We had suggested late September or early October.)</p>
                    <p>— “Owing to understandable reasons, it would not be appropriate for Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to come to China.”</p>
                    <p>— Our aircraft should go directly to Shanghai from Alaska. (Presumably they
                        don't want an American plane crossing the bulk of their country.)</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> had suggested
                        an interim visit; that <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> would
                        be leaving the Paris talks next week; that you had total confidence in him;
                        and I thus hoped <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> would review our
                        conversations and make it possible for <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to maintain contact with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in the future when I am unable to do so. (Comment:
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> expressly agreed to an
                        interim visit by <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> or me. The
                        Chinese have now apparently decided that it would be too awkward for them to
                        receive <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and me, given their
                        troubles with Hanoi and the speculation about a U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> deal on Indochina. Thus I did not press <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>'s acceptability for an interim visit
                        but hope to get Peking to reconsider him for future assignments.)</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d12-02" facs="d12-02"/>
                    <p>I made a few other points to Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>:</p>
                    <p>— The Nationalist Chinese are stirring a campaign against my trip to Peking
                        and your forthcoming visit. There is press speculation about my
                        conversations with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> which is
                        designed to embarrass both the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. My backgrounder which I sent to the Chinese will remain
                        the only U.S. Government commentary on these subjects and any speculation
                        doesn't come from government sources.</p>
                    <p>— We will continue to inform the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> of any
                        talks we have with other socialist countries which concern it.</p>
                    <p>— We will show restraint with the press in our comments about the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in any event, but we would appreciate it if
                        they would do the same. The best way for us to keep our right-wing
                        opposition under control is to demonstrate that we are pursuing an
                        independent policy; this is made easier if the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> does not encourage left-wing spokesmen.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the meeting I told him that we would alert him whenever I was
                        coming to Paris in case he had messages for me or it seemed worthwhile for
                        us to meet. As for the technical details of my October visit, I said these
                        could be passed through <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> and
                        there was no particular urgency.</p>

                    <p>As part of this package, our courier will hand you two messages—one for the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Ambassador which you should deliver
                        in written form (Tab A) and the second (Tab B) which you should read to the
                        North Vietnamese representative, leaving no copy. We are most anxious that
                        the messages be delivered on Friday.</p>
                    <p>At Tab C is the game plan for the next round which is in memorandum form and
                        which includes the planning details which you will need, less aircraft
                        numbers and types. I will provide that information to you telephonically.
                        You will note that we have changed the major arrival and departure fields to
                        assist in maintaining cover. The rest of the details follow the standard
                        pattern. As of this writing, there will be no side meetings during the next
                        round.</p>
                    <p>You may wish to raise with <persName>Henry</persName> your return visit.
                        Dependent on the outcome of the next session, I believe the circumstances
                        are fortuitous.</p>
                    <p>Thank you again for your invaluable contributions which have proved so
                        successful up to now. You will note that in his press conference yesterday,
                        the President may have inadvertently added to the specification that secret
                        meetings are being conducted. His comments will further complicate your
                        already difficult task.</p>

                        Republic of China to the following matters:</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Government has not replied formally to the Soviet proposal for a
                        conference of the five nuclear powers. It is transmitting an oral comment to
                        the Soviet Foreign Ministry through the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow along
                        these lines:</p>
                    <p>The subject of nuclear disarmament is worthy of serious consideration. A
                        conference would require careful preparation and agreement among the five
                        powers as to what subjects were feasible for discussion. The views of
                        non-nuclear states should be considered. All five powers must be willing to
                        attend.</p>
                    <p>It is not anticipated that a formal reply will be made.</p>

                    <p>6 August 1971</p>
                    <p>After meeting Sgt Sigler this morning at 0800 I immediately called Tsao at
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Embassy. Actually,
                            <persName>Wei</persName> answered. I told him I had a message and asked
                        when I could deliver it. He said that 1530 would be convenient for them at
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Residence.</p>
                    <p>After completing my meeting with the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, I
                        went to the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> Embassy and arrived exactly
                        on time. Was let in by <persName>Wei</persName> and Tsao. Led to same room
                        where <persName>Henry</persName> saw them. More jasmine tea and lichee nuts.
                        I gave the written message to Tsao who read it to the Ambassador in
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador said he presumed this was in line with our informing them on such
                        matters. I said that was my understanding. He asked how it came. I said by
                        courier and he seemed pleased and said he would pass it on.</p>
                    <p>He said he was pleased to see me as we were both Generals. I replied that I
                        knew he had had two very distinguished careers as a soldier and as a
                        diplomat. Again he seemed pleased.</p>
                    <p>He discussed the time it takes to get from Paris to Peking (21 hours) and
                        Paris to Washington. He had no idea how long it took. I told him 7 or 8
                        hours.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then asked where <persName>Henry</persName>'s plane would come
                        from in Alaska. I said I did not know. It could be Anchorage or perhaps from
                        further West such as Adak or Attu. He noted that some of those islands had
                        been taken by the Japanese early in the war but that they had been taken
                        back by us. All had gone well for the Japanese at the beginning but after
                        that they had been defeated. At this point Tsao said Japanese militarism had
                        been reborn. I said I hoped not as the world was too small for wars. The
                        Ambassador nodded vigorously and said that it was “just a small ball”.</p>
                    <p>He then asked if I would accompany President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> or Doctor <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on their trips to China. I said that this was a
                        matter beyond my competence and I had no idea of the composition of the
                        parties, but I would be happy if asked to go. (I give you my word of honor
                        he brought it up and foregoing is exact report.)</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d14-02" facs="d14-02"/>
                    <p>We then (with Tsao and <persName>Wei</persName>) discussed languages, the
                        study thereof, that I should learn Chinese (I interjected, “The language of
                        nearly a quarter of mankind.” They liked that.) etc., two more cups of tea,
                        preserved apple. They seemed genuinely anxious to have me stay. I suspect
                        they may not have too much contact with foreigners and enjoy it. I was
                        escorted to the door and patted on the back, etc.</p>

                    <p>ORAL NOTE</p>
                    <p>MESSAGE NO. 1</p>
                    <p>“In an interview with Mr. Szulc of the New York Times, the Ambassador of the
                        Peoples Republic of China in Canada hinted at the possibility of reopening a
                        Warsaw channel. The President shares the common assessment of Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Peking that the reopening of
                        the Warsaw channel would be unwise at this time. The difficulty of
                        instructing Ambassadors and keeping the contacts secret and the danger of
                        confusion of channels would make the reopening of the Warsaw channel
                        inadvisable prior to the President's trip. Confining exchanges between the
                        Governments to this channel offers the best guarantee of achieving the malt
                        expeditious implementation of the objectives agreed to during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to Peking.”</p>
                    <p>MESSAGE NO. 2</p>
                    <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will be in Paris
                        secretly on August 16 on other business and wishes to meet briefly with the
                        Ambassador of the Peoples Republic of China at 9:00 A.M. In addition to a
                        technical matter, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, in
                        line with his discussions in Peking with the Prime Minister of the Peoples

                        situation surrounding events in East Pakistan. Consistent with the
                        discussion held in Peking which contemplated <pb n="3" xml:id="d15-03" facs="d15-03"/>that we would inform the Peoples Republic of China of any

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> proposes to outline the
                        general approach being considered by the President designed to prevent the

                    <p>9 August 1971</p>
                    <p>Dear Al:</p>
                    <p>Herewith the latest scenario. Immediately upon receipt of your letter and
                        verbal notes I called Mr. <persName>Wei</persName> and he offered 1530 for a
                        meeting. I accepted. Immediately after that I called Mr. Lieu and arranged
                        to postpone next Monday's meeting until 11:00 a.m. (I did not mention the
                        day over the phone—only the hour.)</p>
                    <p>At 1530 I went (on foot) to the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> Embassy.
                        I was received at the gate by <persName>Wei</persName> and Tsao and escorted
                        into the living room. The Ambassador arrived almost immediately. I said I
                        had received this morning two verbal notes for them. First I read them in
                        French and <persName>Wei</persName> translated for the Ambassador. Then I
                        dictated them in English to Tsao who wrote them down in English.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he would transmit them at once by swift safe means
                        to Peking.</p>
                    <p>Re the appointment with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>,
                        he would have to get Peking's views and would let me know.</p>
                    <p>Jasmine tea, lichee nuts and for the first time dried apricots. Further
                        discussion of languages. Ambassador said Chinese were teaching Mandarin (Kuo
                        Yu) in all schools as linguistic quarrels and difficulties had been an
                        obstacle to unity for two millenia. Short language lesson for me—when I went
                        to China I would learn easily, etc.</p>
                    <p>Near the end, the Ambassador said that he would see Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on Monday at 0900. If there was
                        any difficulty about this, Mr. <persName>Wei</persName> would call me
                        beforehand.</p>
                    <p>I said I knew how busy the Ambassador was and was grateful for his seeing me
                        so promptly. He said that my visits were in the interests of both our
                        countries and therefore he was always glad to see me. I said that I did not
                        wish to delay them and after one more cup of tea (the 4th) and two more
                        lichee nuts, I was escorted to the door by all three.</p>

                    <p>Again I felt the reluctance to let me go. It seemed to me that for them to
                        talk to an American was like talking to someone from another planet. (I feel
                        a little bit that way about them myself). Meeting could not have been more
                        cordial. It lasted 35 minutes.</p>

                    <p>9:05 a.m.-10:45 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You arrived last night?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You had a good rest?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I have come to
                        France secretly eleven times byfive different methods. I am going to write a
                        detective story when I am through.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You have very intelligent methods. I
                        transmitted your message and I will now let Mr. Tsao read in English a
                        response in order to save time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tsao: (Reading): An oral message of August 16: “During the interim visit
                        talks will still be held between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Peking. The special plane will enter Shanghai
                        and then fly to Peking after a Chinese navigator boards the plane. As to
                        specific details concerning the visits, we would like Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> first to give his views for
                        consideration.” <pb n="2" xml:id="d17-02" facs="d17-02"/>Is that all right
                        [the English]?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's very clear. That
                        is a message?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tsao: An oral message.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: There is a second point I would like
                        to speak about, concerning the negotiations between <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> and the New York Times' Mr.
                        Szulc.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't have complete
                        diplomatic relations with the New York Times, so we are very grateful.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I would like to tell the Doctor about
                        this conversation. In his off the record conversation with New York Times'
                        correspondent Mr. Szulc, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                            Hua</persName> did not give a direct reply when asked whether the Warsaw
                        Talks would continue in the future, but only said that neither side has
                        declared that the Warsaw Talks have ended. These words are in accord with
                        the tacit understanding reached by the two sides at the talks in Peking. It
                        is the understanding of the Chinese government that the Warsaw Talks now
                        exist in name only and that neither side has an interest to reopen the
                        Warsaw channel. However, bureaucratic documents may sometimes still be
                        transmitted through it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is exactly our
                        understanding. That is correct. We were told by Mr. Szulc that your
                        Ambassador had indicated perhaps that we should open the Warsaw Talks. But
                        this clears it up completely. We are in complete agreement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Would you like some tea?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: It is the best tea
                        in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You are quite accustomed to Chinese
                        tea?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not, but I like it
                        very much. Mr. Ambassador I have actually a long list of items which I would
                        like to discuss with you if I could.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Our cook is trying to make some
                        Chinese specialties for our honored guests.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I absolutely adore
                        Chinese food.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d17-03" facs="d17-03"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: If next time you come in the
                        afternoon, I'll give you more Chinese things to eat. Obviously the Chinese
                        cooking here is not as good as in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am sure. Should I
                        start?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wanted, in line with
                        my conversation with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName>, to inform you about some new developments in our
                        relations with the Soviet Union. You can be sure that we will be meticulous
                        about keeping you informed. The Prime Minister will remember that I spoke to
                        him about negotiations going on at that time with the Soviet Union,
                        concerning attempts to try to lessen the dangers of accidental nuclear war.
                        It now seems probable that within the next two weeks we will
                        complete/initial a draft text of an agreement on this question.</p>
                    <p>The Peoples Republic of China is the first country we are informing of this.
                        We will talk to other countries and our allies, including France, later this
                        week. I would like to give you, Mr. Ambassador, for the government of the
                        Peoples Republic of China the general provisions of this agreement. They are
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>— Each side, that is to say the Soviet Union and the U.S., will improve its
                        organizational and technical procedures to guard against the accidental or
                        unauthorized use of nuclear arms under its control.</p>
                    <p>— Second, each party will notify the other immediately in the event of an
                        accidental or unauthorized incident regarding accidental detonation of
                        nuclear weapons which could risk the outbreak of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>— The parties will notify each other immediately in the event of detecting
                        unidentified objects if such occurrences could create the risk of nuclear
                        war between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>— Each party will notify the other in advance of any missile launches which
                        will extend beyond its national territory in the direction of the other
                        party.</p>
                    <p>— In other situations involving unexplained nuclear incidents each party will
                        act so as to lessen the chance of misinterpretation <pb n="4" xml:id="d17-04" facs="d17-04"/>by the other party.</p>
                    <p>These are the principal provisions, and I want to add a few additional items
                        of information for the Prime Minister and for the Government.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is attempting to get us to agree to make the agreement
                        applicable to other countries also. For example, they have asked to include
                        a clause inviting other countries to participate in the agreement. Secondly,
                        they have asked us to include a clause in which we and the Soviet Union have
                        an obligation to report about events in other countries similar to events
                        occurring between the two countries which must be reported in this
                        agreement. In other words, we have to report about you and the French.</p>
                    <p>We have refused both of these proposals. We cannot prevent the Soviet Union's
                        making unilateral declarations to that effect, but we shall under no
                        circumstances associate ourselves with it. We will make agreements with the
                        Soviet Union only on subjects of direct concern to our two countries, i.e.,
                        the Soviet Union and ourselves.</p>
                    <p>As I told your Prime Minister, we are prepared to sign a similar agreement,
                        on a bilateral basis, with the Peoples Republic of China, but we shall not
                        propose it publicly, and we shall leave the initiative to the Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Shall we eat a little?</p>
                    <p>(There was then a short break for tea and Chinese specialties, during which
                        there was some light banter about Chinese food and linguistic abilities.
                        )</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a few other
                        things to talk about. The reason I go so fast is because I have another
                        meeting later about which you might hear later. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) I think the Ambassador is better
                        informed about my activities than anyone else, certainly better than our
                        Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>As I told the Prime Minister when I was in Peking, there is a possibility, a
                        probability, that there will be an agreement between the Soviet Union, the
                        United Kingdom, France, and the United States about access procedures for
                        Berlin. This is a highly technical negotiation which has no direct
                        implications for the Peoples Republic of China, but if you want I will,
                        through General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>, let you
                        know the general <pb n="5" xml:id="d17-05" facs="d17-05"/>provisions. This
                        leads to a final point—I would be glad to answer any questions now if you
                        wish on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have listened with great attention
                        to what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has said and
                        will transmit it to our Government.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This leads me to
                        another point which I've already discussed with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> when I was in Peking. As you
                        remember, Prime Minister Chou-En-lai said that the Peoples Republic of China
                        would welcome a meeting between the Soviet and American leaders and asked my
                        views on that subject. I told Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> that, prior to my coming to Peking, we had told the
                        Soviet leaders that after we made some specific progress in negotiations we
                        would be disposed to have a meeting with them. I said that we had told this
                        to the Soviets before going to Peking, and I told Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> when I was there.</p>
                    <p>I am certain that they will now propose a meeting to us. I want to inform you
                        that we will not have a meeting with the Soviet leaders before we have a
                        meeting with the Chinese leaders. I have already informed you about that. We
                        may announce the meeting before going to Peking, but that meeting will not
                        take place before a meeting with the Chinese leaders. If we announce the
                        meeting, we will give you a week's advance warning before the public
                        announcement. It is not yet certain, but it is very possible.</p>
                    <p>Now let me make a general observation. Since my visit to Peking it is the
                        obvious Soviet strategy to give the impression that they can outmaneuver the
                        Peoples Republic of China by seeming to come much closer to us because they
                        can offer us much more. We understand this strategy. We made a fundamental
                        decision before we visited Peking to put our relations with the Peoples
                        Republic of China on a new basis. We are not affected by these maneuvers. I
                        am prepared to discuss our relations with the Soviet Union fully and openly
                        with the Prime Minister when I am in Peking, and in the meantime I will
                        inform him through you. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> nods.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That means that during your next visit
                        to Peking you will discuss this with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and keep informing him through me in
                        the meantime?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. That is we will
                        make sure that you will confront no surprises. On any actions that we take
                        that we believe affects your interest, <pb n="6" xml:id="d17-06" facs="d17-06"/>we will want to know your views. I have a whole list of
                        other technical points if the Ambassador has patience.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will be happy to listen to you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is in order to
                        keep you informed on all matters we believe of interest to the Peoples
                        Republic of China. That is why it takes so long.</p>
                    <p>After my visit to Peking the Japanese Government suggested either a visit by
                        the President to Japan or a visit by the Emperor to the United States.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> smiles.) We have avoided these
                        invitations by proposing that the President greet the Emperor in Alaska when
                        the Emperor is on his way to Europe, for one hour. So the President will
                        meet the Emperor from 10:00 to 11:00 at night on September 26 at Anchorage,
                        Alaska at the airport. (Mr. Tsao laughs.) The Emperor was stopping there
                        anyway to refuel his plane. He is not making a special trip.</p>
                    <p>Prior to my visit to Peking we had invited the Prime Minister of India to
                        visit the United States on November 9. She has now accepted this, perhaps
                        because she has a slightly guilty conscience. The invitation was extended in
                        April. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> asks for the meaning of guilty
                        conscience and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        explains.) She wants to prove her nonalignment. She accepted it after the
                        treaty with the Soviet Union. She will receive a correct reception.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to let the Prime Minister and the Government of the Peoples Republic
                        of China know our general policy with respect to the Subcontinent.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> asks questions of his interpreter
                        during much of this conversation to make sure that he understands what Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is saying.)</p>
                    <p>We face a very difficult situation. The Government of India has a real
                        problem with refugees, but also wants to use this opportunity to humiliate
                        Pakistan. We are prepared to help with the problem of refugees. We will not
                        participate and will strongly discourage any attempt to humiliate Pakistan.
                        We face a very difficult domestic situation in the United States. Indian
                        propaganda is extremely skillful and the opposition party in the United
                        States, which controls Congress, is completely on the side of Indian
                        propaganda. They make it next to impossible to continue military supplies to
                        Pakistan, for example. We are therefore adopting the following strategy. We
                        are attempting to separate <pb n="7" xml:id="d17-07" facs="d17-07"/>the
                        issue of relief of the suffering in East Pakistan and the refugees from the
                        issue of the political future of East Pakistan in which there is no support
                        in the United States. In other words India attempts to get us involved in
                        the political future of East Pakistan. We take the position that this is for
                        Pakistan and not for us.</p>
                    <p>We are appointing this week a senior official to coordinate the movement of
                        food and other emergency relief into East Pakistan. And we will also make
                        him responsible for consulting with the Government of Pakistan to develop a
                        program to make it possible for a maximum number of refugees to return home
                        so as to deprive India of any pretext for intervention.</p>
                    <p>I tell you informally that our impression is that the Government of Pakistan
                        is honorable but not imaginative. Anything that other friends of Pakistan
                        can do to encourage it to be imaginative so as to make it possible for the
                        return of the refugees to a maximum extent, will help our general strategy
                        of removing the pretext for India to intervene, to take military action.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: To create a Bangla Desh?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's not what we are
                        recommending.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I hadn't finished. For in order to
                        create a Bangla Desh India is obviously interfering in the internal affairs
                        of Pakistan and is carrying out subversive actions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We agree with that. We
                        are trying to make it more difficult for India to do this. We have told
                        India that if it starts military action we will cut off all economic aid.
                        This is why it is important that Pakistan not start a war.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also knows what has happened recently on the
                        India/Pakistan border. Indian artillery has fired continually on Pakistan
                        territory and Pakistan has protested.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are aware of
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: The friends of Pakistan here in Paris
                        say that the Pakistan Government is doing all that it can to repatriate
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: With all honesty, Mr.
                        Ambassador, the Pakistan <pb n="8" xml:id="d17-08" facs="d17-08"/>government
                        is not very imaginative in psychology and in its political strategy. They do
                        ten little things instead of one big thing. And they do ten little things
                        over ten weeks instead of all at once. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Pakistan's friends in Paris say that
                        India has greatly exaggerated the number of refugees.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't know because
                        they don't permit foreign observers in these areas. We will attempt to find
                        means to start our economic assistance to Pakistan again, and the man we are
                        appointing, Mr. Williams, is going this week to Pakistan to see with the
                        Pakistan government how we can recommence this aid. We give economic
                        assistance together with other countries, and up to now the other countries
                        won't give and we are searching for ways to start it up again.</p>
                    <p>We are prevented by our Congress from giving military assistance but we
                        understand it if other friends of Pakistan will give them the equipment they
                        need. But we will do what we can in the economic field and we will have a
                        large program to supply food and other material to prevent chaos in East
                        Pakistan. And we will do nothing to embarrass the Government of Pakistan by
                        any public statements. We leave it to the Government of the Peoples Republic
                        of China, but any views that it may have on this subject will be taken very
                        seriously by us.</p>
                    <p>I have only two more matters. I am afraid Mr. Tsao has a long telegram to
                        write. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We will make a very detailed
                        report.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The first has to do
                        with my trip. I must be in the United States during the week of October 25,
                        because President Tito of Yugoslavia will visit Washington during that week
                        beginning October 25. I would therefore like to propose, subject to the
                        approval of the Government of the Peoples Republic of China, that I pay my
                        interim visit during the week of October 18 for three to four days, say four
                        days. Starting the 18th, 19th or 20th, whichever is more convenient. I
                        understand that the Prime Minister said the second half of October.
                        Whichever is more convenient to the Peoples Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will transmit this to the Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After we have your
                        reply we will make specific proposals <pb n="9" xml:id="d17-09" facs="d17-09"/>about the agenda, etc. It would also be helpful if we
                        could have the proposal of the Prime Minister about when we should announce
                        this visit.</p>
                    <p>I will arrive in one of the airplanes of the President and come either from
                        Hawaii or Alaska—I have not yet decided. So you will let me know about the
                        date and your proposal for an announcement? And how we should make it?</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to propose to the Government of the Peoples Republic of
                        China a possible date for the President's visit to the Peoples Republic of
                        China. I have two dates. The first is for about a week starting February 21,
                        1972. The second possibility is for the same period starting March 16, 1972.
                        We leave it to the Government of the Peoples Republic of China to tell us
                        the date.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Do you have a preference between these
                        two dates?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: A slight preference for
                        February but it is not decisive. Today I really have an enormous amount of
                        business to do with you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I am prepared to listen as long as you
                        want, as long as this does not compromise your next visit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that the
                        Ambassador knows that my next visit is already compromised. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) When I was in Peking, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> was very kind to me. I
                        have a note here welcoming him to the North American continent. It also says
                        how he can get in touch with me if I can be useful to him. I wonder if you
                        could transmit it for me?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will transmit it as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One other thought for
                        your consideration. It is conceivable—I can't imagine it now—that there may
                        be an emergency in which communications to Paris are difficult, and if in
                        those circumstances, the Government of the Peoples Republic of China wants
                        to be in touch with us rapidly or we with it in a crisis, my letter suggests
                        how this can be done. We understand that this is only for emergencies and
                        that this is the principal channel, the one here. As far as I am concerned
                        you can use any of the telephone numbers there. The safest is the White
                        House number <pb n="10" xml:id="d17-10" facs="d17-10"/>because they always
                        are in contact with me. That is designed for jealous wives who can always
                        find their husbands. On your side I leave it to you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We will tell you later.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When I was in Peking,
                        the Prime Minister asked me how much Lend Lease aid we gave in World War II.
                        It is for his scholarly pursuits. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        laughs.) The total amount is $48.4 billion. The program technically ended in
                        March 1948. Twenty-five per cent of this went to the Soviet Union. That's
                        all I have.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That includes military equipment?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will have to check.
                        This was before inflation. I want to tell you one other thing. I am taking
                        General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> home for a week's
                        vacation. He will return August 25.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: I will be available
                        after that for any information you want to transmit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Does that create any
                        problems for you?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will transmit all that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has said to Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and if I have anything
                        I will transmit it after August 25.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: Thank you Mr.
                        Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it possible in
                        protocol to send my personal regards to the Prime Minister who impressed me
                        very much?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will transmit them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I look forward to
                        seeing him again.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Now you are compromising your next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then explained the
                        various telephone numbers and the White House switchboard. )</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The White House always
                        answers. During the day it is better to call me direct. The second number in
                        the letter is covered from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. The White House number is
                        twenty-four hours a day. The first number is always in contact with me no
                        matter when. It is better to contact me with the first number.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: They can always
                        find him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Sometimes it is very
                        embarrassing.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ambassador:</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the North American continent. It is clear from news reports that
                        you have already received warm greetings in your new post, and I would like
                        to add my own.</p>
                    <p>I will always retain vivid memories of my forty-nine hours in Peking and the
                        graceful hospitality with which my colleagues and I were received.</p>
                    <p>Please feel free to call upon me whenever you believe I can be of assistance,
                        whether it be to clarify events or provide you with government publications
                        (unclassified, of course!).</p>
                    <p>I thought it might be useful for you to have my telephone numbers at which
                        you could reach me quickly if some urgent matter required it. The White
                        House switchboard always knows my whereabouts and its number is Area Code
                        202, 456-1414; my direct office number is 456-2235. Alternatively, you could
                        also contact Winston Lord of my staff whom you met in Peking, either via the
                        White House switchboard or at his home, 363-8221.</p>
                    <p>Best regards,</p>
                    <p>His Excellency</p>

                    <p>8:45 a.m. - 10:40 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: The traffic is terrible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We took what we thought
                        was a shortcut, and there turned out to be a traffic jam.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: There were many
                        Americans in the quarter, and we wanted to avoid them. (Chinese
                        laughter)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Since my trip to China
                        I am very well known in America.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: In the whole world.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I must tell the
                        Ambassador a story. The other day the manager of a nightclub singer asked me
                        if I could help her client sing in the nightclubs of China. I said, “just as
                        soon as they establish some.” (Chinese laughter)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That was a good answer. Would you like
                        some tea? You made a long trip yesterday. I see you are in good health.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I had a little vacation
                        on the West Coast.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d19-02" facs="d19-02"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> (to General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>): You went to the United
                        States?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: Last time, yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> was also with me on the West Coast.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: If Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agrees, I'll transmit a message. This is in
                        response to your questions of August 16 and September 1. In order to gain
                        time I will have Mr. Tsao read the message. (Mr. Tsao then read an oral note
                        as follows, full text also attached at Tab A):</p>
                    <p>“The Chinese Government agrees that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s four day interim visit to China should take
                        place beginning October 20.</p>
                    <p>According to its customary practice, the Chinese side would issue a press
                        release only upon Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        arrival in China and not in advance. But if the U.S. side deems it necessary
                        to make the visit known beforehand, the Chinese side proposes that the two
                        sides issue on October 14 their respective press releases of the same
                        content in the following wording:</p>
                    <p>'The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the
                        United States of America have agreed that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will visit Peking in the latter part of October
                        for talks with the Chinese Government to make concrete arrangements for
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        China.'</p>
                    <p>As for the U.S. proposal regarding the time of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China, it may be discussed
                        and decided upon during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s interim visit.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I raise two
                        questions? One concerns the following. If the announcement is made on the
                        14th and if we arrive on the 20th, then it is necessary on the 14th to
                        announce the date of my arrival, because there would only be a week in
                        between and I would have to leave in four days (after the announcement). The
                        date (in the Chinese draft) only says the latter part of October.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d19-03" facs="d19-03"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: The 20th would be toward the end of
                        October.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we announce on the
                        14th … I assume when you say the 20th, that means I have to arrive there on
                        that date.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That means I must leave
                        Washington the 17th or 18th, because I lose a day going West. If we make an
                        announcement on the 14th and I disappear three days later, it will look very
                        odd if we don't announce it (the date of arrival in Peking).</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You're saying that if one announces
                        October 14, it is better to specify that you arrive on the 20th.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to check. My
                        instinct tells me that we would prefer to make an announcement a few days
                        earlier. It is easier for us frankly to make the announcement a few days
                        earlier. I must get together a different group than last time and must
                        arrange for our airplane because we used the Pakistani airplane last time.
                        But I will give you an answer within 48 hours.</p>
                    <p>The second problem we have, Mr. Ambassador, this is minor, that is … (at this
                        point light refreshments were served). You have an unfair advantage. I love
                        Chinese food. After this I will agree to anything.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Pas trop de zéle!</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For us a movement of
                        the President is a matter of great complication. We would like to know
                        whether the two dates we gave you are generally acceptable or whether while
                        I am in China another date completely different will be proposed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That I can't answer. I believe that in
                        talking directly with the Prime Minister you can settle all these
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Perhaps you can tell
                        the Prime Minister we will hold both dates, but it will be very difficult to
                        have another.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I'll certainly tell him.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d19-04" facs="d19-04"/>
                    <p>(There was then some light conversation while Chinese delicacies, wine and
                        tea were being consumed. The talk revolved around food and hospitality,
                        concerning both of which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> praised China. The Ambassador said that Americans
                        were noted for their hospitality too. He said each country had its good
                        qualities, although not all of them necessarily had good food. Note was also
                        made that spaghetti was brought back to Italy from China by Marco Polo. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that when Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> returned the
                        President's visit, he hoped the Ambassador would come also. The Ambassador
                        noted that when he was Vice Minister he accompanied the Prime Minister to
                        fourteen countries in Asia and Africa. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also remarked that concerning Japanese food he
                        gets embarrassed to ask what it is sometimes, because he is not sure that he
                        could then eat it.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I think the problems can be easily
                        solved with the Prime Minister when you are in Peking.</p>
                    <p>I have another thing to say.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I noticed you have
                        another piece of paper.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You raised the question last time,
                        concerning your proposal about another channel. It seems to us for the
                        moment that there is no need to use the Ottawa channel. If it is necessary
                        to be further considered, then this question may be discussed under certain
                        circumstances during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This was only for
                        emergency. For normal business we want to use this channel. Our suggestion
                        was only for unusual circumstances when it is difficult to use Paris. We can
                        discuss that when I am in Peking.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of things that I would like to cover concerning my
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>We will give you an answer on the announcement of the visit and the text
                        within a few days.</p>
                    <p>I have always been very honest and meticulous with the Prime Minister and
                        therefore I want to inform you of what may happen. As I told you last time,
                        we are constantly receiving Soviet approaches now about this <pb n="5" xml:id="d19-05" facs="d19-05"/>or that negotiation, and we have always
                        informed you immediately. We do not inform them of our conversations with
                        you. And the Prime Minister should know that they do not know from our
                        sources that I see you and what I discuss with you. One reason is that no
                        American sources know I am talking to you except the President. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>As I told the Prime Minister and as I told you on August 16, the Soviet Union
                        has made several proposals to us about a possible visit to the Soviet Union.
                        We have told them that we would not visit the Soviet Union until after we
                        have visited the People's Republic of China. However, we expect that Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, who is arriving in
                        the United States on September 19, will bring a formal invitation. Since we
                        have already delayed our answer for three months, it would be difficult to
                        delay an answer again because they have met all our conditions regarding
                        outstanding negotiations. And to be quite honest with you, the reason we had
                        proposed September 21 or September 22 for the announcement was so that
                        whatever we and you announced would not appear as a reaction to the visit of
                        the Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> comes to the United Nations,
                        not to the United States, but it is customary on each visit to the United
                        States that he visit the President. (There followed some discussion in
                        Chinese among the Chinese.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That means you propose to announce the
                        visit on the 21st?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You remember, on
                        September 1, General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>
                        proposed that we announce my visit to China on September 21. We chose that
                        date—we didn't know then—because it has been normal for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to come to the United Nations at
                        that time. He is not coming at our invitation; it is normal. It is also
                        normal when he comes to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that he visits
                        the President. Frankly, we therefore wanted to announce my visit to China
                        before we talked to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. We
                        didn't wish to say this to you because we didn't wish to embarrass or
                        exercise pressure on you. Since then we have been told of his visit. He
                        arrives September 19. He will probably see the President on September 29,
                        which is the latest possible date. It is not a visit to America. It is a
                        visit to the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: If in your view we announce you're
                        going to China on the 21st, what date do you expect to go to China?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The one we discussed,
                        October 20.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d19-06" facs="d19-06"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: He was explaining
                        only why we proposed the 21st (for the announcement).</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The arrival date is no
                        problem for me. Or the 22nd for the announcement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We will await your answer.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can report to the
                        Prime Minister that the arrival date of October 20 is acceptable. The
                        announcement text I want to check in Washington and it is probably
                        acceptable, but I wanted you to know of the other problem.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: On the question of the date of the
                        announcement you will let us know through General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And if you have any
                        different views, you will let us know.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We will let you know.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I just wanted to make
                        sure you knew why, and if anything important happens between <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and the President which bears on
                        the question of the President's visit to Moscow, I'll let you know as soon
                        as possible. But it will be in no case before the President's visit to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>In fact, if we visited every country that invites us before we visit China,
                        we will spend all our time traveling. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        laughs.)</p>
                    <p>May I raise some practical questions with regard to my visit to China?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I am ready to hear and to transmit
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My crew and my pilots
                        will be the same as those accompanying the President when he goes to China.
                        This means that there will be about eighteen to twenty members in the crew
                        of the plane. Of those, four will be guards, four will be communicators,
                        four will be pilots and navigators, and the rest will be stewards. We will
                        give you a list of their names and their passport numbers within a week.
                        There are many technical questions connected with this plane that I don't
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>(Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d19-07" facs="d19-07"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: You have an
                        aeronautical engineer here.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have asked our
                        technical people to write them down. I will give them to you and perhaps you
                        can give them (the answers) to General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>. It has to do with what type of fuel, etc. (Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> hands list at Tab B to
                        Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: I think you have an
                        aeronautical engineer here.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will arrive from
                        Hawaii to Shanghai, with one stop at Wake Island, just to get fuel. We plan
                        to arrive on the 20th in daylight hours so that we can go on to Peking in
                        daylight hours, because the pilot would like to know the approach to the
                        Peking airport.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That is no problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We wanted to let you
                        know. In my own party it will be up to ten people, and I have a list of the
                        types of people we will take along. I would like to explain it to you.</p>
                    <p>I told the Prime Minister that China has suffered the visits of many
                        barbarians, but never the advance party for a President. This will be a test
                        of your historical experience. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        laughs.)</p>
                    <p>My party will be composed of two types of people, subject to your approval. A
                        group of substantive people similar to ones I had on my previous visit, with
                        only one or two secretaries in addition. Secondly, I would like to bring
                        three or four technical people who can make preliminary preparations for the
                        President's visit.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I must absent myself for a few
                        minutes. I have something to do right now. (The Ambassador left the room for
                        about two minutes during which there was some small talk.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: These technical people
                        are comprised of the following. First there is a press man from the White
                        House—not a journalist.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: He belongs to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZRL1">Ziegler</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d19-08" facs="d19-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have the uneasy
                        feeling that you know more about the White House than I do. You certainly
                        know more about General Walters than I do. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>Second, a representative from White House Communications Agency about
                        communications.</p>
                    <p>Third, one representative of the U.S. Secret Service who is responsible for
                        the personal security of the President.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: He has nothing to
                        do with secret service.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have called to their
                        urgent attention the Prime Minister's comment that the security of the
                        President in China is your responsibility. They have promised me that they
                        will be less in evidence in the People's Republic of China than they are in
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>(Chinese laughter)</p>
                    <p>The fourth man is a specimen who exists, to the best of my knowledge, in no
                        other country. I will explain about him. It is a particular form of
                        decadence. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) He is responsible
                        for all the technical arrangements for a Presidential visit. It is a job
                        that is done by protocol in all other countries. I have asked them to write
                        down the problems that they want to discuss, and frankly they are not worth
                        my time or the Prime Minister's time. For example, how many cars should be
                        in a motorcade, where the baggage is to be stored, etc. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) Unless this fascinates the Prime
                        Minister I propose we let the advance man handle this.</p>
                    <p>I will bring a junior member from each of these departments. This is for two
                        reasons. One, he can have only very preliminary discussions, so both sides
                        know what is in the other's mind without any possibility of deadlock or
                        misunderstanding. Two, while this sort of problem bores me, if they are in
                        my party I can control them entirely, but if they come completely alone it
                        is more difficult (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs).</p>
                    <p>To be honest, I am not sure that they know all the fine points of
                        sovereignty. I guarantee that they will learn that when I am along. (He
                        hands over the list at Tab C.) These are the types of points they will
                        discuss.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d19-09" facs="d19-09"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: That is, the

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This will not be to
                        make a final decision, but to have a very preliminary discussion. They won't
                        want a final decision there when I come. (Mr. Tsao reads the list
                        quickly.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We will transmit this to Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I repeat this is only
                        for a very exploratory conversation. Before the President's visit this can
                        be worked out in greater detail, but this would help our planning to have
                        some preliminary ideas. If you don't want them, we can have them come
                        separately later. My personal recommendation is that the discussions will be
                        better controlled if I am there. Here is a list of the members of the party.
                        (He hands over the list at Tab D.) I have already said it orally.</p>
                    <p>I think Mr. Tsao will be busy on his telegram. (Chinese laughter)</p>
                    <p>We have one additional problem about this which I will talk to you about
                        frankly. Contrary to my previous visit, I must on this trip involve some
                        members of the regular bureaucracy. (Chinese laughter) We have not used the
                        opportunity to go through the process of cleaning them out. We still have
                        many members of the old bureaucracy. In other words, we have not reduced our
                        bureaucracy in the way the Prime Minister explained to me he had reduced
                        his.</p>
                    <p>I would like therefore to propose to the Prime Minister the following
                        procedure. We should have two types of meetings. One of the entire group … I
                        am discussing procedures when I am there.</p>
                    <p>First of all, none of the technical people will attend any meetings with me.
                        The technical people should speak to their colleagues.</p>
                    <p>Among the other group I propose two types of meetings. One, when all the
                        members of my group, less the technicians, will be present. At those
                        meetings the Chinese side can explain its general position along the lines
                        that the Prime Minister explained, for example, to Mr. Reston of the New
                        York Times. Your general philosophy, general views.</p>
                    <p>There should be another type of meeting at which on our side there would only
                        be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> and one secretary, at
                        which we could work out with precision some of the understandings of our two
                        sides and some of the details of the conversations of the President's visit.
                        I will leave it <pb n="10" xml:id="d19-10" facs="d19-10"/>to your subtlety
                        to arrange these meetings so that they will appear to take place naturally.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> smiles.) While I have these
                        discussions with the Prime Minister, we can let the other members of the
                        group discuss cultural exchange and trade and technical issues.</p>
                    <p>I have every confidence that you can manage this very well.</p>
                    <p>Now as for what I would like to discuss with the Prime Minister. First, the
                        approximate length and itinerary of the President's visit. We are thinking
                        of up to seven days, and, as I discussed with the Prime Minister in Peking,
                        perhaps two other places. But you are the host and we will wait for your
                        proposal. I don't need the answers until I get there.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, in our official party for the President, we will bring very few
                        people—the President, myself, the Secretary of State, one or two aides for
                        each, and technical people. We propose that when the President is in the
                        People's Republic, the meetings are split up, like during my visit, on the
                        two levels. We propose also that these be split into two parts similar to my
                        visit. That is to say, the Secretary of State can have separate
                        conversations with your acting Foreign Minister. But that too we can make
                        definite when I am in Peking.</p>
                    <p>I just want to give the Prime Minister a chance to prepare himself so I am
                        not surprising him. Also the Prime Minister and I should discuss the conduct
                        of these meetings (during the President's visit), the approximate schedule,
                        and which side should raise which question.</p>
                    <p>As a former professor, I am given to pedantry.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You have thought of everything.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As for the agenda, I
                        think that the Prime Minister and I should cover some of the same topics we
                        discussed previously in more detail. Of course, this is always subject to
                        your counter proposals. Of those topics I believe that the issue of Taiwan,
                        the Soviet Union, Japan, and Indochina should be discussed in detail only in
                        the smaller group.</p>
                    <p>Also, the Prime Minister and I should discuss some of the concrete results
                        that should emerge from this visit, from the President's visit. We believe
                        that these discussions can have a historical significance and therefore
                        should not fail for lack of preparation or pressure of time while <pb n="11" xml:id="d19-11" facs="d19-11"/>we are there. Therefore it is important
                        to prepare them as carefully as possible. In addition to some results which
                        we cannot announce but which we will nevertheless carry out, there is some,
                        I believe, we could announce as a result of the President's visit.</p>
                    <p>For example, the Prime Minister proposed to me that there could be periodic
                        visits of a senior American representative to Peking. We would be prepared
                        to agree to this, and in addition we are prepared to recommend periodic
                        visits of senior Chinese officials.</p>
                    <p>We will be prepared to extend an invitation to the Prime Minister to visit
                        Washington as a return visit to the President's visit to Peking. All of this
                        is to be announced after the President's visit, not after mine. It is just
                        to be discussed during mine.</p>
                    <p>Third, we are prepared to make any agreement with the People's Republic of
                        China that we have already made with the Soviet Union. For example the
                        problem of war by accident, of unintended war, or the improvement of
                        communications for emergency. We are aware of the Prime Minister's view that
                        the People's Republic of China does not want to be lassoed by the existing
                        nuclear powers, and we will make no such proposal.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to discuss cultural and scientific exchange, for example, the
                        exchange of medical personnel, academic exchange, weather information,
                        surveys of earth resources. We will also be prepared to discuss the
                        establishment of civil air links between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>This is in addition to whatever I have already discussed with the Prime
                        Minister. And of course any topic which the Chinese side wishes to raise
                        with us.</p>
                    <p>One more word on the technical side, and then I have two or three substantive
                        matters. This has to do with the number of press people the President will
                        have to bring with him. I have told our people that it should be a minimum
                        number. Their definition of minimum is between 100 and 150 people.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) Or two divisions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: A company.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think you and he
                        (General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>) have a plot among
                        Generals.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d19-12" facs="d19-12"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: It is necessary to
                        have Generals for peace.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He (General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>) tells me you want him to study
                        the subway of Peking.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps for my visit, Mr. Ambassador, your side could consider what would be
                        the minimum and maximum number of press people. (This was not translated.) I
                        will bring no journalists at all.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It will be necessary to have an extra
                        plane for the journalists.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For the President's
                        visit, yes. This is usually true.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: For the journalists only. Even big
                        airplanes?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: It will be
                        necessary to charter a plane for them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I must tell you, Mr.
                        Ambassador, their manners are bad even by American standards, and I don't
                        know what you will think of them by Chinese standards. (Chinese laughter) If
                        you tell me when I come to China—I don't need to know in advance—what you
                        consider the minimum and maximum number, then we will be guided by your
                        views.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You can discuss this with the Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I only want to give in
                        advance the type of things I will be discussing with him. All I can tell you
                        is that Mr. Reston is one of our humblest journalists. I tell you when I
                        read his interview with the Prime Minister I couldn't tell who the Prime
                        Minister was. I am not referring to the Prime Minister—Mr. Reston behaved as
                        if he were head of a sovereign country. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) We have no complaint at all about
                        what the Prime Minister said. I was commenting on the long speeches that Mr.
                        Reston made to the Prime Minister which was not characteristic of a
                        journalist. We thought the Prime Minister's answers were very understanding
                        and not at all surprising.</p>
                    <p>I want to let the Prime Minister know a number of relatively minor things.
                        The Ambassador of Romania saw me at the request of his President. He
                        expressed concern about some of the pressures that were being put on
                        Romania. I want the Prime Minister to know what I replied.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d19-13" facs="d19-13"/>
                    <p>One, the U.S. has a major interest in the independence and autonomous policy
                        of Romania.</p>
                    <p>Two, the U.S. will do nothing directly or indirectly that amounts to
                        collusion that would enable another great power to infringe on the
                        independence and autonomous policy of Romania.</p>
                    <p>Three, the U.S. will make clear that pressures for military action are not
                        consistent with relaxation of tension.</p>
                    <p>Four, the President ordinarily never receives Ambassadors, but he will see
                        the Romanian Ambassador and will repeat these statements to him personally.
                        And we will announce the visit of the Romanian Ambassador but not the
                        content of the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Two other pieces of information. One, with respect to Pakistan. We will
                        announce during October certain relief for debts which Pakistan owes, to the
                        extent of $75 million.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: What do you mean by relief?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Pakistan has declared a
                        moratorium on its international debts which ends in October. We will work
                        out a rescheduling, the practical consequence of which will be that Pakistan
                        will benefit to the extent of $75 million. I frankly don't understand the
                        details myself.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, our calculations are that for relief in East Pakistan there will be
                        needed between $250 and $300 million. And we will pay 75 percent of that, up
                        to $250 million.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: In what form?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the form of food,
                        counterpart funds, and direct appropriations. Counterpart funds are
                        Pakistani money which we control.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: Pakistan rupees
                        which belong to America.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wanted to reaffirm to
                        the Prime Minister what I said to him with respect to Taiwan when I was
                        there. Because the press is very active in its speculation at this time.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d19-14" facs="d19-14"/>
                    <p>Finally, the Japanese press has announced that I am visiting Japan in the
                        very near future. It is not true. There is no such plan.</p>
                    <p>I think I've given enough to Mr. Tsao to keep him busy.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: He will do it with pleasure.</p>

                        arrival in China and not in advance. But if the U.S. side deems it necessary
                        to make the visit known beforehand, the Chinese side proposes that the two
                        sides issue on October 14 their respective press releases of the same
                        content in the following wording:</p>
                    <p>“The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the
                        United States of America have agreed that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will visit Peking in the latter part of October
                        for talks with the Chinese Government to make concrete arrangements for
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        China.”</p>
                    <p>As for the U.S. proposal regarding the time of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China, it may be discussed
                        and decided upon during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s interim visit.</p>

                    <p>Dear Dick:</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to our phone conversation, attached at Tab A you will find the oral
                        note which you will wish to read to the Chinese Ambassador in Paris. At Tab
                        B is an additive statement for you to also give orally to the Chinese
                        Ambassador when you complete reading the oral note. This is designed to give
                        him unofficially and not for our files the flavor of our reasoning for the
                        dates mentioned in the oral note.</p>
                    <p>At Tab C is our preferred version of the announcement which you are to hand
                        to the Chinese Ambassador. You will note that the dates are left open both
                        with respect to the President's visit and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s preliminary visit, pending receipt of the
                        Chinese reply to our earlier inquiry. If this reply is not received prior to
                        your meeting with the Chinese Ambassador you should make it clear to him why
                        the dates are blank.</p>

                        be signed in Washington on September 30, 1971. This fact is still secret.
                        Provisions will be those outlined by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang

                        announcement should be made at 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM, September 20, 21 or 22,
                        Washington time, with preference for September 20.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will pass through Paris
                        on September 11 and can settle these matters then with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName>.</p>

                    <p>In passing this oral note, Walters should add orally:</p>
                    <p>That the dates for the announcement were selected because of State visits the
                        following week. The President will be in Anchorage on September 26,
                        following which there will be State visits the 28th and 29th in Washington.
                        The Accidental War Agreement will be signed on September 30th. We want to
                        get this announcement made before the Accidental War Agreement.</p>

                    <p>Call on Chinese Ambassador:</p>
                    <p>From: <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">V.A. WALTERS</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>Following your call on the evening (Paris time) of Aug 31st. I called the
                        Chinese Embassy and made arrangements to see the Ambassador on the morning
                        of 1 Sept. I spoke to Tsao.</p>
                    <p>At 0730 on September I met courier Middleton at Orly. His plane arrived a
                        half hour early. Took him into the office and took cognizance of the
                        contents of the envelope he brought me from you. At 11 a.m. Paris time I
                        called alone at the Chinese residence in Neuilly and was received as usual
                        by <persName>Wei</persName> and Tsao and very shortly afterwards we were
                        joined by the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was cordial as always but it seemed to me that I detected a sort
                        of embarrassment on their part at the fact that they had not yet had an
                        answer to the questions asked by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> when he saw them on 16 Aug. They did not say
                        flatly that they had not had an answer but this was clear to me and I did
                        not press them in order not to increase their embarassment.</p>
                    <p>I then read the Oral note, first in English for Tsao and then in French for
                        Wei, both of whom took careful note of it. Following that I added the
                        additional oral message contained in your tab B. They also took careful note
                        of this and as instructed I then handed them the text of the proposed
                        announcement and added that our preferred date was the 21st as instructed
                        verbally by you, as well as the rest of your telephone instructions. They
                        seemed a little confused at these dates but I explained them to their
                        satisfaction, mentioning that the Anchorage trip was due to the passage
                        there of the Emperor of Japan as related by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> the last time he saw Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName>. This brought dawn and
                        comprehension.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that he would see Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on the morning of the 11th subject of course to
                        Peking's authorization. He also asked whther it was our desire to make the
                        announcement concerning the President's visit and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit at the same time, and I
                        replied that it what I understood from the text of the announcement which we
                        were submitting to them. He understood fully why there were blank dates in
                        our proposed text.</p>
                    <p>That was about all there was in substance, but there was as much usual chit
                        chat as on other occasions. The Ambassador said that hoped that the Emperor
                        of Japan would not return to the deeds of early in his reign, such as
                        attacking China and Pearl Harbor. I said that the Emperor was now the symbol
                        of the Nation and the Ambassador said that real power was in <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s hands. The Ambassador then said that
                        it was very interesting that the channel for messages between the two
                        governments passed through the hands of soldiers (himself and me) For the
                        first time in history Mankind had the means to destroy itself. China was
                        dedicated to peaceful coexistence and would do everything to bring this
                        about. I replied that when the Chinese got to know America better they would
                        find that this was true of us too. For many years we had had the monopoly of
                        an absolute weapon and had never chosen to use it. He nodded. He then asked
                        whether I had enjoyed my vacation in the U.S. I replied that vacation was a
                        grandiose word as I had been in Washington from Monday to Friday and had
                        spent Saturday and Sunday at my brothers returning to Paris on the following
                        Monday. Thus my vacation had lasted two days.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d22-02" facs="d22-02"/>
                    <p>I said however that I had no complaints to make as my work was most
                        interesting. He leaned forward, tapped me on the knee and said “it is most
                        important for all of mankind.” </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName> then asked me
                        whether my Soviet Colleagues had ever asked me about Sino American
                        relations. I answered truthfully that they never had. He then asked whether
                        the Soviets knew about Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s trips in secrecy to Paris. I replied that I did not
                        know for sure, but that experience with the Russians had convinced me that
                        they were very intelligent but were not all 2 meters tall. He roared with
                        laughter and slapped me on the back.</p>
                    <p>He then asked me what I did for exercise other than bicyling, (another
                        demonstration of biographic expertise) and I replied that I skied in the
                        winter and swam in the summer when I had time. Unlike many Americans I
                        walked a great deal. I said that in my country with 220 million people there
                        were about 100 million cars and this was not conducive to much walking (He
                        seemed staggered at the figures and asked me to repeat them) however we
                        still did quite well in the Olympic Games. I then noted that a Chinese
                        jumper had recently set a world mark and he said that this man had done even
                        better more recently. He then said that recently he had raced an elderly
                        Frenchman who though more than 80 years of age could still race. I asked who
                        had won and he said that he had taken his opponent's age into account and
                        the race had ended in a tie. I then said that I could see why he had been
                        made an Ambassador. He looked pleased at this and said that we were both
                        soldiers but he was a beginner at diplomacy. I said this was true of me too.
                        (No thunderbolts from heaven struck the Chinese Embassy during this
                        exchange). I then told him the story about the man who asked what was the
                        difference between the military and the diplomats and another man had
                        replied “None. They both do nothing, but the military do it very early in
                        the morning in complete discipline and the diplomats do it late in the
                        afternoon in utter confusion.” He laughed and said it must surely have been
                        a politician who said that.</p>
                    <p>All of this was is the usual room in the Chinese Embassy, accompanied by
                        Jasmine Tea, preserved apples and rice wine (I had only one glass and it
                        tastes nearly as bad as Vodka). There were two new elements, excellent
                        Chinese Ravioli and some small shrimp cakes, which like Lichee nuts I eat
                        only in the service of my country. Only Dr. K apparently rates incense.
                        There was none for me.</p>
                    <p>There was more of this but I will not bore you with the detail. My stay with
                        them lasted about 45 minutes. I went there on foot and as far as I could
                        tell (which is not far) I was unobserved. I was ushered to the door by all
                        three as usual.</p>

                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, <date when="1971-09-03T11:00:00">September 3,
                            1971, 11 a.m.</date>
                    </dateline>
                    <p>On September 3, 1971 in pursuance of instructions received during the night,
                        I called at the Chinese Embassy in Paris at 1100. As usual I was received at
                        the gate by <persName>Wei</persName>, (dressed for the first time in
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> uniform with Red Mao badge
                        with profile in gold of the great one), and at the entrance to the building
                        by Tsao. I was led into the living room and after about two minutes
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName> joined us. On
                        the table there was the inevitable jasmine tea, preserved apples and Lichee
                        nuts.</p>
                    <p>I then delivered my message regarding the forthcoming negotiations between
                        the Soviet Union and ourselves in an effort to reach an agreement to prevent
                        incidents at sea. I said this was desirable because of the proximity of
                        Soviet ships to ours. The Ambassador grinned and said he hoped that there
                        would be no collisions. I said that I understood that this was the purpose
                        of the forthcoming negotiations. He then asked at what level the
                        negotiations would be held and I replied that I did not know (which was not
                        true) but my personal guess was that it would be at Asst Secretary of the
                        Navy level.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then abruptly brought up the population problem, saying that
                        Khruschev had once said that a Czechoslovakia (17 million) was born every
                        year in China. The Chinese felt this could be a problem and were endeavoring
                        by education, not coercion to reduce their birth rate. This was difficult to
                        do in a country where large families had always been considered desirable.
                        Still their efforts had borne fruit and the population increase was down to
                        about 10 million a year.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName> then pressed more tea
                        and preserved apples on me, and asked whether I had seen the French
                        television show on Chinese anaesthesia by acupuncture (needles). I said that
                        I had and he added that this was a great Chinese dicovery that would be of
                        benefit to all humanity. About two years ago they had discovered that it was
                        possible to anaesthetize in this way thus avoiding the shock of anaesthesia
                        by conventional means that was often dangerous to patients with heart
                        trouble. This technique was now widely practiced throughout China, at least
                        in the great cities like Shanghai and Canton. The Chinese had made another
                        great discovery recently and this was the cure of polio victims through
                        acupuncture. We had found a vaccine but they had discovered a cure which
                        enables victims to walk again. What a difference this would have made to
                        President Franklin Roosevelt who had had great prestige throughout the
                        world. He then said that James Reston had written very objectively about his
                        stay in China. I asked “about everything?” He grinned and said “At least
                        about his medical treatment.” He then said that the Chinese were quite
                        prepared to exchange these techniques for others developed by the United
                        States and other countries for the benefit of mankind.</p>
                    <p>They were grateful for the news I brought, though not effusively so. This
                        time there was no trace of the embarrassment that I had noted on my last
                        call on them. This time I again noted strongly the desire to keep me as long
                        as possible. The atmosphere could not have been more cordial. The Ambassador
                        said I would have a chance to see all this when I went to China. He said
                        that he had already transmitted to Peking the messages I had previously
                        given him and as soon as he had an answer he would be in touch with me. They
                        took careful notes while I was delivering the message about the
                        negotiations, but took no notes during the subsequent chit chat.</p>
                    <p>After 4 cups of Jasmine tea, three slices of preserved apples and no lichee
                        nuts. I was most cordially escorted by all to the door.</p>

                        TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14. TEXT OF MESSAGE TO BE CODED.</p>
                    <p>Please contact Chinese Ambassador to Paris on September 14 if possible or not
                        later than September 15 and deliver orally repeat orally the following
                        message. Please confirm when message has been delivered:</p>
                    <p>Quote: The President agrees that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s interim visit to China should take place for
                        four days starting October 20. He also agrees to the text of the
                        announcement proposed by the Chinese side.</p>
                    <p>The date of the announcement is however inconvenient. The reasons are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The date proposed by the Chinese Government may make the announcement
                        appear as a reaction to the visit in the United States by the Soviet Foreign
                        Minister as already explained by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. Since the visit is public certain preparations in logistics, scheduling
                        and organizing the group for the visit have to be made which cannot be
                        started until after the announcement.</p>
                    <p>The President would, therefore, appreciate it if the Government of the
                        People's Republic of China would agree to the announcement on <pb n="2" xml:id="d24-02" facs="d24-02"/>September 22, 23, or October 4 in that
                        order of preference. (The date would be Washington time and the hour 10:00
                        a.m.) Unquote.</p>

                    <p>September 23, 1971</p>
                    <p>Very late at night on September 22, 1971 (close to midnight), I received a
                        phone call at home from Tsao saying that they wished to see me at 1700 on
                        the following day. By mutual agreement, we keep phone conversations to a
                        minimum.</p>
                    <p>On September 23 at 5:00 p.m., I went alone and on foot to the Chinese Embassy
                        and was as usual met at the open garden gate by <persName>Wei</persName> and
                        at the entrance to the building by Tsao and the two of them ushered me into
                        the red living room. Within a minute, the Ambassador joined us.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other occasions when they had a message for me, no portfolio was
                        visible and small talk lasted much longer than when getting down to business
                        on previous occasions.</p>
                    <p>Despite the press speculation on Chinese events which originated in Paris and
                        the denial issued by the Chinese Embassy there that <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> was ill or dying, I did not bring up
                        current events in China and neither did they.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that there was a large Chinese colony in the United
                        States, many had gone there during the great railroad building period in the
                        middle of the Nineteenth Century. I said that they were one of the most
                        law-abiding communities in the United States. Very rarely was one involved
                        in criminal matters. He said that the Chinese were and are a very
                        hard-working people. I agreed saying that very many of the Chinese who had
                        come to the United States poor were now well-to-do. He said that many had
                        gone also to British Guiana and Trinidad. I said I knew this because my
                        mother was born in Trinidad. There the Prime Minister was black and the
                        leader of the opposition was Indian, but the governor appointed by the
                        British was Chinese. He got a chuckle out of that. He then said that the
                        Prime Minister of Guiana was also of Chinese extraction. I said I was sure
                        the Governor of Trinidad was Sir Robert Ho Tung, but I did not know that Mr.
                        Burnham was also.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d25-02" facs="d25-02"/>
                    <p>He then said that China ever since the Opium War in 1840 had been a European
                        colony and exploited as such. I noted that this was no longer true and he
                        grinned. He then said somewhat irrelevantly that this was the reason why the
                        Chinese People were so peace-loving and anxious to see peace established
                        everywhere.</p>
                    <p>He then said that he understood some French, a few words of English and some
                        Russian but spoke it badly. I said I did, too, and we then spoke banalities
                        in Russian. It was true in both cases. We both spoke it badly but this
                        prevented me from having an inferiority complex. He then laughed aloud and
                        said that no one would ever believe that the Chinese Ambassador to Paris and
                        the American Defense Attache to France were talking together in Russian, but
                        then no one had to know. He complimented me and poured my fifth cup of tea
                        himself (first time). Then we got down to business. (All of the foregoing
                        lasted considerably longer than indicated by this memorandum.)</p>
                    <p>He motioned to Tsao who reached under the sofa on which he was sitting and
                        pulled out a black portfolio from which he extracted a single sheet of
                        paper. He then started to read it to me in English. The Ambassador said that
                        this was a waste of time and to hand it to me so I could copy it. This I
                        then proceeded to do and read it back to Tsao to make sure there were no
                        mistakes. There were three but we corrected them. While I was writing, I
                        could feel them watching closely to see if there were any change of facial
                        expression when I got to the tougher phrases. I made sure there was
                        none.</p>
                    <p>When I was through, the Ambassador said that I must surely have used up the
                        small strategic reserve he had given me on the previous occasions (an
                        allusion to the preserved apples and dates). No General should ever be
                        without reserves; Napoleon had said that God was on the side of the biggest
                        battalions so I should have more. With that he produced a two-pound box of
                        preserved apples made by the Peking City #1 preserved fruit factory (Peking
                        Guo Fu). As the box of dates was all in Chinese, it was beyond my linguistic
                        powers. He then explained to me that the dates had to be cooked inside the
                        cellophane in a double-boiler. I did my best to appear enthralled and
                        grateful.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then asked if I had been travelling recently. I said that on
                        the long Labor Day Weekend of September 6th, I had gone to see the Chateaux
                        of the Loire. He then asked whether I was <pb n="3" xml:id="d25-03" facs="d25-03"/>busy in my duties as Defense Attache and I replied that
                        the French vacation season was now over and my duties were at their normal
                        level. All the while there was something faintly apologetic in his manner as
                        though he feared perhaps that I might be offended by the tone of the note.
                        This was largely a feeling on my part based on a considerable number of
                        meetings with him. He asked how I had come and I said that I had left my car
                        with the Diplomatic plates some distance away and had come on foot checking
                        insofar as possible to see whether I was followed and if I had been I had
                        not noticed it. He nodded approvingly and again said that he enjoyed talking
                        to me. He put his arm on my shoulder and said good-bye. When he had more he
                        would get in touch with me. I was escorted out in reverse order to arrival.
                        They were as cordial or perhaps a touch more than on previous occasions.</p>

                    <p>1. In view of the fact that the U. S. Government will, around September 23,
                        put forward to the United Nations General Assembly its draft resolutions
                        designed to create"Two Chinas” which the Chinese Government firmly opposes,
                        the Chinese side cannot agree to the issuance of the press releases on the
                        interim visit at the said time. The Chinese side agrees that the two sides
                        issue their respective press releases on the interim visit at 2200 on
                        October 5 (Peking Time) in the text agreed upon by the two sides.</p>
                    <p>2. The agenda and arrangements for the talks during the interim visit can be
                        discussed and decided upon after Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s arrival. The purpose of the talks to be held
                        during President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        China was already officially announced on July 16, namely, “to seek the
                        normalizations of relations between the two countries and also to exchange
                        views on questions of concern to the two sides”. It goes without saying that
                        the talks should concentrate on the principal issues without diversion of
                        attention to side issues.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chinese side will give a separate reply in regard to personnel
                        arrangements and services for the special plane and other matters.</p>

                    <p>September 24, 1971</p>
                    <p>I mentioned briefly to you in Paris my concerns regarding a possibility which
                        cannot be totally dismissed. Namely that the Government of the Chinese
                        Peoples' Republic are genuinely world revolutionaries and anxious to move
                        the course of history in a direction in keeping with their ideology. The
                        fact that they just did it to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> adds to my belief that we should consider this
                        contingency or at least not just dismiss it. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName> said quite bluntly that Sato could not come to Peking
                        but after the Japanese revamp their government, then one of his successors
                        could come. “He could even come in a special plane.” That last sentence rang
                        a small warning bell in my mind.</p>
                    <p>I do not say the following will occur but I would hate to see us caught
                        totally unprepared if it did. In the hypothesis that they really are
                        revolutionaries and want to help the “Progressive Forces” elsewhere, would
                        it not be a supreme coup for them at some point in our dealings with them
                        (and it seems to me that it would have maximum effect if they were to do it
                        after the President's trip to Peking), to break off the talks and issue a
                        statement that they had tried to be reasonable but it was impossible to do
                        business and especially make peace with “That Fascist <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>” and announce that they would be
                        happy to do business with the United States as soon as the American people
                        elected a peace loving President from among the progressive forces in
                        America. Five years ago I would have said that this would have been very
                        counterproductive and irritated the American People. I am no longer
                        sure.</p>
                    <p>I fear that it might be a powerful weapon for the President's enemies,
                        especially in the press.</p>
                    <p>This is really none of my business but I feel I would be derelict in my duty
                        if I did not mention it to you. It may never happen, but if God forbid it
                        does, I would not want us to be caught utterly unprepared.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d26-02" facs="d26-02"/>
                    <p>I quote from Sun Tzu, “Subduing the enemy's army without actually fighting is
                        the acme of skill.” I recall Jean Sainteny's book on <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi Minh</persName> where he describes a warm
                        friendly dinner with Pham Van Dong at the Tour D'Argent in Paris where the
                        Vietnamese sat gazing out over the Pressed Duck and the Cathedral of Notre
                        Dame and finally he turned to Sainteny and said, “I who have never been in
                        France before now understand why all of my countrymen who know your country
                        can never forget it.” Yet adds Sainteny, “At Fontainebleau a few weeks later
                        it was He who was the toughest negotiator and He who in the end took the
                        initiative of the rupture that was to be so heavy in consequences.”</p>
                    <p>I know this will not make me popular but I just do not want to see us
                        surprised or caught off balance. I know others have been thinking of it, but
                        it has weighed on my mind. I hope like everyone else that they will not
                        choose to exercise this capability … … … . but they could.</p>

                        Presidential visit to the Soviet Union that would take place before the
                        President's visit to the People's Republic of China.”</p>

                    <p>30 Sep '71</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <p>I returned to Paris at 0730, 28 September 1971. My attempt to contact the
                        Chinese by phone in the morning failed because, incredible as it may seem,
                        there was no answer, either at the Embassy or Residence. Around noon I
                        finally reached Wei Tung and he suggested I come at 5 p.m. This I did
                        following my usual procedures. I was given the usual welcome in the usual
                        sequence and the overstuffed red sofa scenario was also true to form.</p>
                    <p>Knowing their liking for beating around the bush, before getting down to
                        turkey I mentioned that I had just arrived from the States. The Ambassador
                        wanted to know how long it took, what kind of plane. He said he had boarded
                        a 747 when the Chinese Ambassador to Ottawa had left Paris, but had not
                        flown on it.</p>
                    <p>Then he asked about supersonic planes and I gave him a status report on the
                        U.S. SST. He then asked how long it would take the Concorde to fly from
                        Shanghai to Europe and I said 8 or 9 hours and added that I understood that
                        the Chinese might buy 3 of the Concordes. He said they would probably buy
                        more than that (!) but tapped me on the knee and said, “but for the domestic
                        Chinese routes we would buy American aircraft.” I said that this, of course,
                        would be just until they could build their own. He said, “Exactly, you
                        understand well.” He then said that the Chinese had been building military
                        jets when the technical assistance was withdrawn and they (presumably the
                        Russians) thought China would stop, but it had not stopped.</p>
                    <p>Then I delivered the note re the release of the announcement on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s interim visit and the subject
                        of the discussions. This was translated first into French and Wei translated
                        it into Chinese. Then Tsao copied it word for word and I proofread it with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>This note was very cordially received and no noses appeared out of joint. The
                        Ambassador then asked rather pointedly if my side comment on the China lobby
                        and the bureaucracy was mine or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s. I answered that it was an American reality and
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had asked me in a
                        general way to point it out to Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> as I
                        delivered the oral note.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d28-02" facs="d28-02"/>
                    <p>Then Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> abruptly asked me if it was true
                        that the French were not cooperating with us on the drug problem. I said
                        that this was not true; they were cooperating, but much money was involved
                        and therefore it was tough to do away with this traffic. He then said he had
                        heard that in Saigon drugs were cheap and plentiful and many of our soldiers
                        used them. I said that drugs were plentiful and cheap and some soldiers used
                        them. Many was not the right word in the context. Examination of soldiers
                        leaving Vietnam—and nearly two-thirds of the soldiers who had been there
                        when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> became President
                        had left—showed that some four percent had used them. This was still far too
                        many but less than one would have guessed from reading the newspapers. He
                        then asked whether I felt punishment for drug merchants should be severe. I
                        said that it was my personal view that drug peddlers should be executed. He
                        nodded vigorous agreement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then said that he had been very busy
                        with Pai Hsiang Kuo, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade. The French had
                        been putting out the red carpet for him. It was the first time a Chinese
                        Minister had visited Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>I commented that Tsao had much copying to do and he said that Tsao was very
                        able and in addition to English and French also spoke Vietnamese and
                        Cambodian. I discreetly refrained from asking where he had learned them.</p>
                    <p>I then produced a large box of American chocolates and said that he had
                        provided me with reserves and I would be shamed if I did not reciprocate. He
                        asked if they were chocolates and I said they were, but—modest ones. He then
                        poured me my fifth cup of jasmine tea with his own hands.</p>
                    <p>I then told him that on October 2 I would have further information for him
                        about Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s call on the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s non-jasmine tea with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He then invited me with pats on
                        the arm to a Chinese lunch on Oct 2. My heart sank at the thought of what I
                        would have to eat, but I composed myself and tried to look grateful.</p>
                    <p>I was escorted out in accord with the usual ceremony. I noted that the
                        Ambassador wore a very small <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> badge
                        but that neither Tsao nor <persName>Wei</persName> wore one (both in shirt
                        and tie). But Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> still
                        smiled down on us at the entrance. No mention was made of current Chinese
                        affairs.</p>

                    <p>4 October 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <p>As agreed at our meeting on September 29, 1971, I proceeded on 2 October to
                        the Chinese Embassy Residence in Neuilly and was met as usual by
                            <persName>Wei</persName> and Tsao and ushered into the living room where
                        we were joined almost immediately by Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>.
                        He looked at me quizzically and said, “Shall we talk or do business first?”
                        I said that I was his guest and would do as he wished. He said that in China
                        they always acceded to the guest's wishes. I then said that Americans were
                        generally direct and I would do business first. He was obviously anxious to
                        know what I had to say. I then read the oral note to him contained in my
                        written instructions regarding the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s talks with Soviet Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as well as the fact
                        that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be prepared
                        to give Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> a
                        rundown on these. I then informed him concerning the Soviet invitation to
                        the President. He nodded without comment and asked to make sure that this
                        visit would not take place before the President's visit to China. I assured
                        him that this was the case, as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had told him previously. He seemed pleased.</p>
                    <p>Food was then brought in. First, stuffed pastries, stuffed round patties,
                        fried shrimp and, finally, soup. Large quantities of all of these were
                        heaped on my plate at regular intervals. All of this was washed down with a
                        perfumed red wine and a colorless liquid that must have been related to 110
                        octane gas. Inasmuch as the smell of shrimp alone nauseates me, I had to
                        drown it in soy sauce. He noted approvingly that I could eat with
                        chopsticks. Each sip of the colorless liquid gave me the impression that the
                        lining of my throat had been removed but then, unfortunately, the fishiness
                        of the shrimp proved that this was not the case. I was very cautious with
                        the strong beverage, raising it many times to my lips but drinking very
                        little, both to avoid getting drunk and to save my alimentary tract. There
                        was long chit chat about Chinese cooking at those times when I could
                        speak.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> told me he was from Peking and had been
                        on the long March to Yenan. He had known Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> for forty years. In return I confided to him that when I
                        had read him our oral note, it was the first time in my life I had told a
                        non-American the contents of a Top Secret paper. He slapped me on the back
                        and said that they too would keep it top secret. He then said that he was a
                        soldier who <pb n="2" xml:id="d29-02" facs="d29-02"/>had fought for his
                        country for many years but he had come to the conclusion that we must
                        coexist together peacefully despite the differences in our social systems.
                        The American people and the Chinese people were both great peoples each
                        seeking their happiness in their own way.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then asked what I thought of the Soviet invitation that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would certainly convey to
                        the President. I said that I was not a diplomat but that it was ironic that
                        they came in with it after the Chinese invitation. He then said that the
                        Soviets were pragmatic and selfish. They did things only when they thought
                        they were in their own self interest, but the Russian people were a good and
                        great people who had warm fraternal sentiments towards the Chinese people.
                        (I did not disabuse him.)</p>
                    <p>He then said that the visit of Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Pai was going
                        well. Trade and cultural relations with France were growing. He commented,
                        however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> had not
                        been as well briefed on China as he should. The French President had
                        overestimated China's population by a hundred million. It was only 750
                        million, not 850 as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> had
                        said.</p>
                    <p>He then came back to plane, travel time and commented that it only took 7
                        hours to the U.S. but 22 hours to Peking. He added wryly that it was six
                        hours shorter via Moscow but then you had to go to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that he had had 1700 people to the Oct 1 reception
                        at the Chinese Embassy the day before. He had invited them in two sets—1730
                        to 1930 and 1930 to 2130.</p>
                    <p>I then told him that with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> there would be <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston
                            Lord</persName> (he remembered him), a middle level State Dept official,
                        and two secretaries. I hoped to have these names and passports for him
                        later. He then commented that I was not going with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He hoped I would go with the
                        President or after that. I thanked him.</p>
                    <p>I explained that in our country for things like these visits we needed time
                        for preparations and had to work under the searchlight of the press. He
                        nodded, I felt, compassionately. I then asked if I should interpret the
                        Chinese view as agreement with the lists I had presented. He said he would
                        let me know.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d29-03" facs="d29-03"/>
                    <p>He then asked me whether the U.S. would announce an invitation from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and, if so, when. I said that I
                        presumed it would eventually be announced but I really did not know when. He
                        then said he was sure all such details would be worked out between Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the Prime Minister
                        during the former's visit to China.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was a courageous man. It had taken
                        courage to open the dialogue with China. I agreed and said that I personally
                        had had first hand knowledge of the President's courage. I had been with him
                        in the car in Caracas in 1957 when the car had been attacked by
                        demonstrators and was left without police protection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had told the Secret Service agent who
                        wanted to use his pistol, “Put that back in your pocket. When they drag me
                        out of the car, then if I tell you, but only if I tell you can you use it.”
                        Then I cited an incident in Rome last year when the President had stopped
                        his car and gotten out to take a petition from a man who had nearly fallen
                        under the car, even though this man might have had hostile intent. The
                        Italian crowd had seen the President's gesture and cheered. He nodded
                        approvingly and said that this courage on the President's part did not
                        surprise him. (I told both stories in more detail than is recorded
                        here.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then asked me when I expected to leave
                        Paris. I said that I had been due to leave Paris some time ago but now
                        probably would remain for some time. He said that he hoped so as I had
                        helped open a door that had been shut for many years. Whenever I left, he
                        hoped relations between our countries would have been normalized as he
                        wished to give a dinner for me, a real dinner, what we had just had was just
                        a “tea.” I thanked him saying that I would fast for ten days before the
                        dinner. He liked this.</p>
                    <p>I was seen out in the usual sequence with a squeeze of the arm and a number
                        of friendly taps from the Ambassador. He spoke more frankly on political
                        matters at this meeting than any other I can recollect. He promised to
                        communicate further with me when he received additional messages.</p>
                    <p>The lunch and talk lasted almost two hours. It was my eleventh meeting with
                        them.</p>

                    <p>Instructions for General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should read the
                        text of the attached announcement (Tab A) to be made jointly in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on
                        October 12, 1971. After reading it he should tell the Chinese that they are
                        the first country to be notified of this announcement and that a few
                        countries allied with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will be notified
                        shortly before the announcement. We would appreciate discretion. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should add that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stresses again the
                        reaffirmation of the principles governing the U.S. conduct of relations with
                        the Soviet Union and the fact that he will discuss this subject fully when
                        he is in Peking.</p>
                    <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should then hand
                        over the attached lists (Tab B) of (1) the personnel in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s official party, some of whose
                        names they have already received, and (2) the aircraft crew which has slight
                        modifications as noted. He should point out the following:</p>
                    <p>— In addition to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s two
                        personal secret service agents, who were with him in Peking last time and
                        who will perform the same functions as they did on his last visit to Peking,
                        there is one additional member in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Jonathan T. Howe</persName>, U.S. Navy, who is a member of Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s personal staff.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should explain that
                        in this way Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will be
                        able to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> with him for
                        private meetings with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>
                        with the State Department representative in any concurrent meetings on <pb n="2" xml:id="d30-02" facs="d30-02"/>subsidiary questions, and Commander
                        Howe with the other personnel for discussions of technical subjects.</p>
                    <p>— Messrs. Redman and <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName>, whose
                        names were on the aircraft crew list already provided, will also be taking
                        part in technical discussions and thus are now listed in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party.</p>
                    <p>3. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> believes it would be
                        desirable if the following sequence could be used with regard to the
                        questions concerning technical arrangements for the President's visit:</p>
                    <p>— First, the Prime Minister and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> could privately reach understandings on the major
                        technical questions, such as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned to Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        on September 13 (e.g. length and itinerary of President's visit; composition
                        of party; schedule of meetings; press arrangements).</p>
                    <p>— Second, there could then be a plenary session involving the technical
                        personnel on both sides at which the Prime Minister and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> could formally lay out views on
                        the agreed upon basis.</p>
                    <p>— Third, the technical personnel could then conduct their separate
                        discussions within the broad framework agreed to at the plenary session.</p>
                    <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should then make
                        the following remarks, saying that we hope they will help the host country
                        in its planning:</p>
                    <p>— The U.S. side will rely on the Chinese side for interpreters.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d30-03" facs="d30-03"/>
                    <p>— The U.S. side would appreciate it if a room could be set aside for typing
                        and other office work.</p>
                    <p>— The U.S. side would appreciate knowing whether the Chinese side envisages
                        the need for any formal public statements during the course of this
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>— While invitations to any social functions are, of course, entirely up to
                        the Chinese, there is no requirement for Messrs. Redman, Elbourne or the
                        three secret service personnel to be invited to whatever functions may be
                        planned for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>— The U.S. side would hope that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s official party could be housed together or in
                        close proximity. It would be helpful to have Mr. Cuff, a stenographer from
                        the aircraft crew, housed with the party also, in case he is needed to help
                        with clerical duties. The rest of the aircraft crew would preferably be
                        housed not too far from the airport.</p>
                    <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should give the
                        Chinese Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s proposed
                        itinerary (local times). (Tab C)</p>
                    <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should state that
                        the U.S. plans to release the names and the itinerary on October 14 at 1000
                        Washington time.</p>
                    <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> should give the
                        Chinese a copy of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        October 5 press briefing. (Tab D)</p>

                    <p>The leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union in their exchanges
                        during the past year have agreed that a meeting between them would be
                        desirable once sufficient progress had been made in negotiations at lower
                        levels. In light-of the recent advances in bilateral and multilateral
                        negotiations involving the two countries, it has been agreed that such a
                        meeting will take place in Moscow in the latter part of May 1972.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and the Soviet leaders
                        will review all major issues with a view towards further improving their

                    <p>Memorandum for Record: Date 10 October 1971</p>
                    <p>On my return to Paris on the morning of October 9th. I went to my Office and
                        there received, shortly after my arrival a telephone call from Tsao saying
                        that because of unexpected circumstances they could not keep the appointment
                        he had made with my secretary of 1000 hours on that day. He would call me
                        back later to let me know what time they could see me. he did so and set the
                        appointment at 2200 of that same date.</p>
                    <p>At that time I went to the Chinese Embassy residence in Neuilly, not far from
                        my own home. It was dark and in honor of the fact I was received at the
                        outer gate by both Tsao and Wei. Escorted into the living room where the
                        Ambassador joined us a minute or two later.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> enquired solicitously about how I felt
                        after the return trip, jet lag, etc. He then directed Tsao to read to me the
                        note which is attached as appendix A. At the end of this I said that many of
                        the questions asked me were answered in the communication that I was about
                        to give them. The Ambassador then directed Tsao to hand me the three
                        typewritten pages which are attached as Appendix B. These cover the arrival
                        at Shanghai, facts concerning Hungjao airport, radio channels and
                        frequencies etc.</p>
                    <p>I then handed to them the list (latest version) of the crew of the aircraft,
                        the list of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party, I
                        told them about the secret service agents and Cmdr. Howe and conveyed all of
                        the points in the instructions given to me in Washington on October 8th. I
                        then added as instructed that despite many requests Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was not taking any press with
                        him. They seemed pleased. I also expressed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s wish if possible to have tea with
                            <persName>John</persName> Service who was in China. They expressed
                        surprise that he would still be there at the time of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit but promised to convey
                        this fact to Peking.</p>
                    <p>I then handed them the verbatim of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s press conference and they seemed to be expecting
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said that he would transmit all this to
                        Peking as soon as possible. I commented that their desire to have the
                        aircraft in Shanghai between 8 and 9 a.m. on October 20th would require
                        rescheduling on our side. He then said that if they did not hear to the
                        contrary from me they would presume that we were acceding to their request
                        in respect to arrival time.</p>
                    <p>I had however as a first order of business handed them the announcement (or
                        rather let them copy it) concerning the Soviet invitation to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. They made no comment and
                        maintained appropriate oriental inscrutability when I mentioned that China
                        was the first to know and reaffirmed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s statements to the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>They said that housing as requested by us, interpreters etc. presented no
                        problem for them and they would do as we wish.</p>
                    <p>I was then informed that they had prepared dinner for me. I said that I had
                        already eaten but that did me no good. On the other hand the Ambassador
                        explained that he had already eaten and would not eat. The Red perfumed wine
                        was on hand but fortunately the “white lightening” was not. While we ate I
                        was told that electrical current in Peking was 220 volts (for typewriters).
                        I told them I would check to see whether the list of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party was in protocol sequence
                        or not. I told them I would check to see whether we could comply with their
                        arrival time request and also ascertain when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and party would leave China. They said everything
                        could be worked out with the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>There was a good deal of soft soap directed at me. How much they regretted I
                        was not going, that I had made and was making “historic contribution to
                        normalization of relations between U.S. and China.” The Ambassador then said
                        that to hide nothing from me, he had been made aware last April of the
                        approaches I had made to the Chinese <pb n="2" xml:id="d31-02" facs="d31-02"/>Military Attache. He had been informed at once, but “the time was not ripe
                        and he had not received the necessary instructions” so that nothing had
                        worked out then. Meantime little stuffed patties of all sorts, mixed with
                        preserved apples and dried dates were shoveled incessantly onto my plate all
                        washed down by a large number of random cups of jasmine tea and perfumed red
                        wine.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that after the normalization of relations between
                        china and the U.S. the Chinese might well open an airline directly over the
                        route traversed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> with
                        “their Concordes”. He then said that whenever I came to China he hope I
                        would visit him and a further helping of soft soap was ladled onto me.</p>
                    <p>I then said I knew he was busy and took my leave with the reverse ceremony to
                        the arrival. The Ambassador and <persName>Wei</persName> were wearing small
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> badges. Tsao was wearing none.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s great picture still smiles
                        down from the entrance hall.</p>

                        like to be provided with the name list of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party in protocol order (including name, sex,
                        designation and passport number). Entry visas will be issued upon arrival in

                        Shanghai and that of his departure at the conclusion of the visit. It is
                        preferable that the arrival in Shanghai be between 0800 and 0900 on October
                        20th.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. flight crew is requested to wear civilian attire and not to carry

                    <p>13 October 1971</p>
                    <p>Dear Al:</p>
                    <p>Herewith the latest scenario:</p>
                    <p>On October 1 I called <persName>Wei</persName> at the Chinese Embassy and
                        said I had some answers for them. He said that if it was urgent that I see
                        them it could be at 2300 that evening. If it were not, they would prefer
                        1100 on October 13 and I agreed.</p>
                    <p>I went to the Embassy at the appointed time, was received and led into the
                        living room with the usual rites. I gave them the plane's number, call sign,
                        said it would be coming from Guam and would contact Shanghai Air Traffic
                        Control two hours before take off and would remain in contact during flight.
                        I also mentioned the car for the communications and they said that this was
                        already laid on.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said, “You can tell Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that there will be no problems on his trip. I
                        believe all technical details have now been exchanged except that we would
                        like to know if the list you gave us is in protocol order.” I said I would
                        try and find out as soon as possible for him. I believed that was the last
                        answer I might owe them. He agreed that this was the case.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that the announcement of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to Moscow had not aroused as
                        much press comment as his visit to China and I agreed. He then said he felt
                        that the Chinese invitation had provoked the Soviets into extending theirs
                        and I said that this might well be. He said that this was typical of the
                        Soviets who were very pragmatic.</p>
                    <p>He then asked me who in the U.S. Government knew that he and I were the
                        Channels for communication between Peking and Washington. I said that as far
                        as I knew, The President, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and a few people on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s immediate personal staff and my
                        secretary, Miss Ouellette. He said that this was true on the Chinese side
                        also; only very few people knew in his Embassy and in Peking. Most people
                        seemed to suspect that the contact was maintained through the Chinese
                        Embassy in Ottawa. He felt we had both done well to keep it a secret. He did
                        not believe even the French knew.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d32-02" facs="d32-02"/>
                    <p>He then said he had heard that Honolulu was a beautiful place. Perhaps after
                        relations between our countries were normalized he could go home via
                        Honolulu. “In one of your Concordes?” I asked, and he laughed, “perhaps”. He
                        then expressed amazement at the U.S. decision not to build an SST. I said
                        that in my personal belief we would have to at some time in the future. He
                        replied that with our technological competence it should not take us long. I
                        said that the decision would still delay us if we changed our minds. He
                        again expressed satisfaction at our relationship and my discretion and
                        repeated that we were both soldiers, etc.</p>
                    <p>All during this time I was being practically force fed jasmine tea, preserved
                        apples and lichee nuts which I discover to my distress I am beginning to
                        like. He also threatened me with a real Chinese meal soon. He then said that
                        my previous reserves must have been used up and gave me lichee nuts, dates
                        and two boxes of preserved apples, one of which was for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I promised to deliver it
                        soon.</p>
                    <p>I had given him a large bottle of Bourbon on my last visit and will give him
                        a large box of Schrafft's chocolates at our next meeting.</p>
                    <p>This was the most cordial meeting of all with food, slaps on the back, etc. I
                        left according to the usual ceremonial in an aura of good will and in
                        accordance with the usual tribal rites. Only the Ambassador wore a <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> badge.</p>
                    <p>P.S. I had written out the message for the Chinese that I had to convey in
                        French. They asked me to translate it into English as that was the language
                        in which they would transmit it. This may be of interest in connection with
                        the matter I mentioned to you regarding their communications.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:</p>
                    <p>MEETING WITH THE CHINESE ON OCTOBER 14th 1971</p>
                    <p>I had called <persName>Wei</persName> on the morning of the 14th of October
                        to tell him that I had the list in protocolary order. After consultation he
                        asked me to go to the usual location at the Chinese Embassy residence at
                        6.p.m. I agreed and went there at that time.</p>
                    <p>I was received by Tsao alone. He explained that the Ambassador and
                            <persName>Wei</persName> were unavoidably detained by important matters.
                        I said that I understood and what I had was purely a technical answer. I
                        then gave them the list of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party in protocolary order which I had received
                        from Washington. He took note of it and said he thought it fulfilled all of
                        their requirements.</p>
                    <p>Fortified by Jasmine tea and preserved apples we then passed on to more
                        trivial matters. He told me that inasmuch as we were alone he would like me
                        to know how happy he was to have this opportunity to know me and to become
                        friends. He had graduated from St. <persName>John</persName>'s university in
                        China which had been run by Americans and was happy to resume contact with
                        them. He said frankly that if and when diplomatic relations were resumed
                        between China and the U.S. He hoped that he would be assigned to the U.S. I
                        told him that from the point of language he was certainly fully qualified.
                        He said that he tried hard to keep abreast of U.S. matters. Each week he
                        read the Christian Science Monitor and the Economist as he felt that they
                        were the two best sources of information. He was less kind to Time, Newsweek
                        but surprisingly had a relatively kind word for U.S. News and World Report
                        saying that their interviews were often very informative. He said that he
                        found the New York Times and Washington Post full of news but less
                        dispassionate that the Christian Science Monitor and the Economist.</p>
                    <p>He then told me that he was something of a foreign expert, particularly as he
                        had been born in Shanghai and had contact with foreigners for a long time.
                        He said that he also spoke Russian, Japanese and German. We spoke and his
                        Japanese and Russian are as bad as mine and his German is much worse. To
                        console him I said that he also spoke really difficult languages like
                        Vietnamese and Cambodian. He nodded appreciatively.</p>
                    <p>He then apologized again for the fact that the Ambassador was not there, and
                        I added that inasmuch as what I had to transmit was purely technical and not
                        substantive I had not expected the Ambassador to be present. Again he nodded
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d33-02" facs="d33-02"/>appreciatively. I had got him
                        off the face hook. He said that enjoyed talking to me. I was open and frank
                        and very different from what he had expected. He hoped that we would
                        continue to be in touch. I too said how much I enjoyed the talks with him
                        (In which I do most of the talking. They want it that way and I am not
                        averse to setting the record stright in a very low key about the U.S.).</p>
                    <p>With profuse expressions of mutual esteem, I took my leave.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION:</p>
                    <p>MEETING WITH CHINESE ON OCTOBER 15th 1971</p>
                    <p>Late at night on October 14th I had a call from Tsao saying that they would
                        like to see me the next morning. I agreed and they set 1100 as the
                        appropriate time. At that time I went there and was received as always by
                        them in the usual sequence and with the usual rites. Amb. Huang was not
                        present.</p>
                    <p>They then read me a message indicating that they wished to know data
                        concerning the transmitter we would use while Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s aircraft was on the ground in
                        Peking. They read me the following message.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side agrees to the use of a communicator/engineer for purposes of
                        direct communication with Washington during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to Peking. The transmitter will be used
                        every two hours on even days. The Chinese side would like to know the power,
                        call sign, frequencies and method of operation and type of radio
                        transmission.</p>
                    <p>I said that I would pass this on to Washington and would try an get the
                        answers before 18 October as they had requested.</p>
                    <p>We then passed on to Chit chat. They asked me about the role of U.S. Military
                        in politics. I pointed out that we had none, had to resign to run for
                        office, could not make political statements or attend any political meeting
                        in Uniform. We could vote but a law prohibited any military person from
                        being Secretary of Defense or of the Army Navy and Airforce. They looked at
                        me in bewilderment and asked me to repeat this to make sure that they had
                        heard right. I repeated. They then said what about General Eisenhower. I
                        assured them that he had resigned from his five stars before he ran for
                        President and they wanted to know why. I said that this was the way the U.S.
                        operated.</p>
                    <p>We then spoke about the racial question in the United States. I pointed out
                        that we had a Japanese, a Chinese, a Black and a Spanish Speaking Senator.
                        That the Chief of Personnel of the U.S. Army in Europe was a black Major
                        General, that the Ambassador to Sweden was black, so was the Under Secretary
                        of Transportation. That Senator Brooke was elected in a state that had only
                        5% of blacks among its population. All of this was done somewhat less
                        abruptly than recorded here, adding that there were still injustices but we
                        were aware of them and trying to correct them. They appeared surprised at
                        the foregoing and some statistics concerning the income of black families in
                        the U.S. I then mentioned that the Chinese ethnic community was perhaps the
                        most law abiding in the United States. <persName>Wei</persName> laughed and
                        said that they had plenty of crime in China (!!!) I felt it better not to
                        ask whether it was political… They then asked about intermarriage with
                        Vietnamese. I said that there had been some but perhaps less than in
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>Both said that a great effort to learn English was afoot in China, they
                        realized that they needed this to communicate with the world. Tsao added
                        that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> was personally
                        studying English. He could not really speak if but could understood it to
                        some degree. Tsao added that Edgar Snow had met Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> in Yenan.</p>
                    <p>Tsao and <persName>Wei</persName> chuckled over the fact that nearly everyone
                        thought that the contacts between the U.S. and China were being handled in
                        Ottawa. <pb n="2" xml:id="d34-02" facs="d34-02"/>
                        <persName>Wei</persName> said that he had read in the paper that many
                        journalists were watching the Chinese and American Embassies there to see if
                        they could detect how the connection was made. They said that it was well to
                        be discreet in the delicate stage of Chinese American relations. They knew
                        that the opening of the dialogue with China kad not been easy for Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> because of internal
                        opposition in the United States. I said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was a courageous man who would not be deterred from
                        doing what he thought was right by opposition. They nodded agreement.</p>
                    <p>I said that returning to the question of the role of the U.S. Military in
                        U.S. Politics. I must tell them a story of a conversation I had had with one
                        of my Russian colleagues. He had told me that I did not really live in a
                        democracy and when I asked him why he had replied “You are an officer in the
                        Army but you cannot hold political office, whereas I am an officer in the
                        Soviet Navy but I can be a member of the Supreme Soviet”. To which I had
                        replied “But I still have an advantage over you, I can join the opposition
                        and you cannot.” Both Tsao and <persName>Wei</persName> threw back their
                        heads and roared with laughter.</p>
                    <p>Both shovelled out soft soap to me. How frank I was, how much they enjoyed
                        talking to me etc. By this time the jasmine tea was almost coming out of my
                        ears, and one more preserved apple and I would start growing blossoms. Great
                        cordiality and many apologies for the absence of the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>They then asked me what I had thoght about China before I had met them. I
                        said that I had met few (relatively) Chinese before them but that those I
                        had met had lived up to their reputation as a cultured, industrious, hard
                        working people, who had given the world some of its greatest discoveries. I
                        added “You gave us some good things like the compass and printing and some
                        bad things like gunpowder and rockets.” They laughed and obviously enjoyed
                        the exchange. They expressed the hope that I would visit China. I said it
                        was important that as people we get to know one another. One always dislikes
                        what is unknown. They agreed rather solemnly.</p>
                    <p>With further expressions of mutual goodwill and esteem I made my way out in
                        accordance with the usual ceremonial.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD</p>
                    <p>MEETING WITH CHINESE ON SATURDAY OCT. 16 1971</p>
                    <p>On the evening of Oct 15, 1971 Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> called, me to give me the information concerning the
                        operation of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        communications while he is in Peking, which the Chinese had requested. I
                        called Tsao and he said to come on the morning of the 16th at 11.30. This I
                        did and was received as usual at the gate by <persName>Wei</persName> and at
                        the entrance to the building by Tsao. The Ambassador was not present.</p>
                    <p>We started with Jasmine Tea and this time in addition to the preserved apples
                        and dates, there were dried prunes which I would not feed to my cat. I gave
                        them the information concerning our transmitter, its power, call sign,
                        frequencies, primary and secondary, hours of operation, method of operation,
                        in short all of the information which they had requested from us concerning,
                        its operation. They received all of this and then said that they had a
                        communication for me. They then read me the following. (In French)</p>
                    <p>1. The Chinese side will place at the disposal of the American side cars to
                        insure the liaison with the radio transmitter in the aircraft.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chinese side does not contemplate the issuance of any public statement
                        to the press during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        visit to Peking for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Tsao then said that he thought that we had exchanged all of the technical
                        infoformation that was necessary for the trip. I said that I knew of nothing
                        else that was required for the time being,</p>
                    <p>He then apologized for the Ambassadors absence and expressed the Ambassadors
                        high regard for me, which I reciprocated saying that Paris was such an
                        important Embassy that I knew the Chinese had sent one of their very best
                        men here. I then said that I would be absent on a French Army trip for three
                        days next week, but that they could call my secretary if anything came up
                        and she would know how to reach me in a matter of minutes. They then said
                        that the Chinese Attaches to France were also going on the trip and
                        cautioned me that they knew nothing about my contacts with the Ambassador
                        and Tsao and <persName>Wei</persName>. I assured them that I would make no
                        reference with regard to this when talking to the Attaches. <pb n="2" xml:id="d35-02" facs="d35-02"/>We then talked about the United States
                        and they asked many questions about our income tax system. I explained
                        roughly how it worked. They asked how much I paid, what it represented as a
                        proportion of my income. I answered them and they seemed surprised at the
                        progressive rate of our tax. They added that in China there was no income
                        tax I said that ours was tough but that I had quite enough to live
                        comfortably after paying it.</p>
                    <p>They then asked me many questions about the credit card system. I showed them
                        my American Express card and explained how it worked, what the consequences
                        were for someone who lost his credit rating etc.</p>
                    <p>I then gave them a box of Schraffts candy, saying that they had given me much
                        Chinese candy and soy sauce as well and I could not fail to reciprocate
                        without losing face, as face was important in the West also. They seemed
                        amused.</p>
                    <p>Following this I then gave Tsao a copy of the World Almanac which contained
                        much information about the United States, salaries, tax, production etc. I
                        added “don't send it to Peking, they already have it.” He roared with
                        laughter and said that in that case he would keep it for himself.</p>
                    <p>All of this washed down with about a quart of Jasmine tea, my cup being
                        filled every time it appeared to be only 95 full. I departed with the usual
                        tribal and protocolary rites.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>: We have one slight problem, Mr. Prime
                        Minister; we haven't eaten for an hour.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So you are in good spirits.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes we are.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They want to take pictures
                        first.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> from the State Department.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I heard you speak very good
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I was able to converse formerly, but I am out
                        of practice.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And, of course, you
                        remember Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Oh yes. How is your health?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: Very good, thank you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You remember Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>. And this is General <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName>, the Military Aide to the
                        President. And this is Mr. <persName>Chapin</persName> who is the Special
                        Assistant to the President. And this is Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> who is on my staff. And these two
                        ladies are Miss Matthews and Miss Pineau. Mr. Ready and Mr. McCleod.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In charge of documents.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I believe you know all the
                        others on our side, but you are not so familiar with our Acting Foreign
                        Minister, <persName corresp="#p_CP2">Chi P'eng Fei</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d36-02" facs="d36-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I had the pleasure of
                        riding in with him from the airport.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And that is the Deputy Security
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>: You are placing him next to the right
                        person (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This is Mr. Chi Ch'ao-Chu.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>: I have a message for him from <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> ______ of Harvard.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I have a lot of schoolmates
                        probably in Harvard. In the United States, which is first, Harvard or Yale?
                        Maybe Yale isn't so well-known?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are absolutely right,
                        Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In the … in 1910 when I was in
                        middle school, I knew more about Yale than Harvard. At that time more people
                        were praising Yale than Harvard. “I don't know the reason.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Because Harvard people are
                        so retiring. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> is from
                        Yale.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He is younger. And also the time
                        when I became familiar with Yale was in my younger days. In my middle years
                        I became familiar with Harvard. There are other similar universities in the
                        United States, one which the (?) schoolmates went to. But I believe there is
                        one of you from the University of Emory. In what state is that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You people are..</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I heard you later on attended
                        another university. Was that you or someone else?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Duke University. We spoke of <pb n="3" xml:id="d36-03" facs="d36-03"/>Harvard as being the Emory of the
                        North.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So you divide into the North and
                        South? That was 100 years ago.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would like to see the
                        file the Prime Minister has on each of us. I am sure I would find many
                        things I had forgotten.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But to be honest, we haven't
                        done much research on that. But you are a newcomer and therefore we wanted
                        to know something about you. I believe you were also in Tientsin.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, I was in Peking for two years and
                        Tientsin for one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And you still remember the date
                        of the liberation of Tientsin?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: January 15, 1949.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName> was in Tientsin at the same time; he probably
                        didn't meet you. Have any of you others been in China before?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So, if you like we can begin to
                        work. You are an earnest worker.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not like the Prime
                        Minister who, I understand, works most of the night.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But I rest some during the

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I hear that you would like to
                        meet Mr. Service.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Informally
                        sometime.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He will be back on the 22nd. I
                        saw him together with some other American friends. I have not yet seen him
                        individually.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d36-05" facs="d36-05"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I read the conversation
                        you had with that group a few weeks ago.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You have very quick news.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I hope that the Prime
                        Minister realizes that I am being held personally responsible for everything
                        he says.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: [laughs] Today we are meeting in
                        an official meeting here. First of all, I would like to say on behalf of
                        myself and the Chinese government that we welcome Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, the special envoy of the
                        President to come on this interim visit. We also welcome the other
                        colleagues of your party. Our relations with the United States have been cut
                        off for such a long time. The previous visit of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has made an unofficial beginning
                        and, to say the least, it shook the world a bit. And so we should say that
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has made some
                        achievements in this field, and therefore we also are confident that this
                        present official visit made by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to make preparations for the visit of the
                        President will be a success.</p>
                    <p>And, according to custom, we ask you to speak first. I would also like to
                        hear what you have to say out of your big book. I also have written a few
                        papers; last time I had no prepared papers.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I felt very ashamed of
                        myself.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because that was your first
                        visit. No call for that. You had to have something to go by.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister was
                        more coherent without notes than I was with notes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's not… I hope you don't
                        praise me too highly. So, shall we begin?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, I
                        will make a few general observations to start off our discussion. First,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has asked me to
                        convey his personal greetings to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and yourself and the whole Chinese government.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d36-06" facs="d36-06"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I thank you and him. I thank
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> very much.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He looks forward very
                        warmly to meeting with the Chairman and the Prime Minister and he believes
                        the visit can be a historic occasion. The purpose of this interim visit is
                        to prepare for the occasion when the President can have personal
                        conversations with the Prime Minister. And we have three broad categories of
                        issues to discuss: Major substantive issues, similar to those discussed in
                        July but perhaps in greater detail; second, some secondary but important
                        issues which we have communicated through our established channels; and
                        technical arrangements for the visit of the President which is the primary
                        responsibility of my colleagues Mr. <persName>Chapin</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName>, and their
                        colleagues.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the substantive questions, we have two problems: one, with
                        the content of the positions our two countries will take, and secondly, the
                        manner in which these issues are negotiated and in which they will be
                        expressed.</p>
                    <p>We have prepared some suggestions of what might conceivably be said, but as I
                        told the Prime Minister last time, we can agree to more than we can say.</p>
                    <p>Let me make a few observations to express the attitude with which we will be
                        approaching the meetings between our leaders. The President has asked me to
                        reaffirm in the strongest terms his personal commitment to the improvement
                        of relations between our countries for the sake of our two peoples and for
                        the sake of the peoples of the world. We have received much unasked-for
                        advice from other countries, especially one other country in recent months,
                        pointing out the physical limitations of China's power, and therefore, the
                        limitations of concentrating attention on China. Our policy is not based on
                        such considerations. It is produced by profound convictions and not by an
                        attempt to create a power combination.</p>
                    <p>We are, of course, aware that our two countries represent different
                        philosophical views. We recognize also, as the Prime Minister so eloquently
                        pointed out to a visiting journalist, that the People's Republic does not
                        trade in principles, and neither do we. Nevertheless, we believe that the
                        People's Republic and the United States have many congruent <pb n="7" xml:id="d36-07" facs="d36-07"/>interests. It is no accident that our two
                        countries have such a long history of friendship. We believe that peace in
                        Asia and peace in the world requires your full participation. We will not
                        participate in arrangements that affect your interest without involving you.
                        We do not accept the proposition that one country can speak for all
                        socialist countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Not to mention the fact that
                        there are various kinds of socialism.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is correct. We
                        believe there is really but one issue that divides us which is in itself the
                        product of history. If we can take account of each other's concerns on this
                        problem, if we can agree on both a general direction and a process of
                        resolution, as I think we can, then there will remain no fundamental
                        obstacle to our relations. This is the attitude that determines President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s actions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Prime Minister, when we met in July, you said that the announcement of
                        President's <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China
                        would shake the world. The world has been shaken. Our two countries have set
                        in motion new currents and for many nations a whole new set of
                        considerations arises when they conduct foreign policy. We have started a
                        revolution in world affairs, but as you, Mr. Prime Minister, know better
                        than we, it is the essence of any revolution that for a while the old
                        coexists with the new.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Sometimes the new arises from
                        the old. They coexist but the new comes out of the embryo of the old.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Have you read Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HERG1">Heath</persName>'s speech?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So you have many news contacts
                        by now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't come here any
                        more without reading every speech that's been written. You are not going to
                        catch me a second time, Mr. Prime Minister. <pb n="8" xml:id="d36-08" facs="d36-08"/>Many nations have greeted the July 15 announcement with
                        great professions of enthusiasm. However, I will not be telling the Prime
                        Minister anything he doesn't already know if I say that not every country
                        that expressed positive views really felt them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But in this aspect I believe
                        that on your side you know more about this than we do.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: About views of other
                        countries?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In America, the impact
                        of the announcement of July has been profound and on the whole positive.
                        Most of the people have greeted the prospect of better relations with China
                        very warmly, and some even enthusiastically. At the same time, I do not wish
                        to minimize some of the domestic problems we have had. As the Prime Minister
                        pointed out to Mr. Reston, and as Mr. Reston sometimes had difficulty in
                        acknowledging, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has
                        demonstrated great courage in taking this initiative. Since the July 15
                        announcement, we have discovered and I may say I especially in my personal
                        correspondence, that the radical right equals the radical left in their
                        expression of violence, if not in the excellence of their grammar.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: [laughs] There is a phrase that
                        the Chairman often uses: Left in form, but right in essence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are often not easy
                        to distinguish in that extreme form.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Sometimes in form it's a little
                        bit different.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: These groups have
                        mounted campaigns against the President's acceptance of your invitation. And
                        I am telling the Prime Minister no secrets when I point out that even within
                        the bureaucracy some of the established forms continue. We expected these
                        reactions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Also such things like that in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would assume that
                        bureaucracies have certain similar characteristics in every country.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d36-09" facs="d36-09"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We talked a lot about that last
                        time. Your two colleagues will remember that. They took a lot of notes on
                        that. And I see that Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> is smiling, so we
                        think bureaucracy cannot only be found in the State Department; it can also
                        be found in the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My secret dream is to
                        do to the State Department what the Prime Minister did to his office—reduce
                        it to three.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That was my small office—there
                        are only two. But I cannot do that to the whole Foreign Ministry, nor to the
                        State Council. You can ask our Acting Foreign Minister about that. As you
                        just mentioned, the philosophy and world views of our two countries are
                        quite different obviously, but it seems on these matters we have the same
                        language. I think your two colleagues can bear witness to that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have been threatening
                        them with the Prime Minister's methods ever since we have returned from
                        China.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That would be imposing our will
                        on them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have become an
                        excellent method of discipline in my organization.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But the whole world admires you
                        for being able to keep such a big secret. Some people have compared it to
                        the secrecy that was kept toward the end of the Second World War about the
                        explosion of the atom bomb.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But this was much more
                        constructive.</p>
                    <p>At any rate, we expected these reactions, and we are determined to master
                        them, and to continue the course which we started last July. I believe we
                        have made a constructive beginning in recent months, and I want to take this
                        opportunity to express to the Prime Minister the great appreciation we all
                        feel for the meticulous manner in which the People's Republic has carried
                        out every understanding that was arrived at last July. I said to the Prime
                        Minister in our last session that we should take each other as men of honor,
                        and this has been your conduct since last July. We have tried to act in the
                        same way.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d36-10" facs="d36-10"/>
                    <p>Now, looking at the future, Mr. Prime Minister, as we look toward the
                        President's visit, I think we must sort out those questions which can be
                        solved immediately, those which can be agreed in principle but take time to
                        implement, and those that must be left to longer processes. You can be sure
                        that whatever we agreed to will be carried out scrupulously. I do not say
                        this as a pretext for avoiding fundamental issues, but rather to guarantee
                        the success of their resolution.</p>
                    <p>Let me now turn to what we can accomplish here in the next four days, both
                        substantively and technically. The major issues, of course, are those we
                        discussed last time, on which we understand and recognize that the most
                        important for you is the issue of Taiwan. In addition, we discussed
                        Indochina, relations with other countries such as the Soviet Union and
                        Japan, South Asia, especially the India-Pakistan dispute which we believe is
                        taking very ominous turns, Korea, and some issues on arms control.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to go into each of these subjects in some detail, including
                        putting progress that can be made on them into specific time frames. We
                        could shape an agenda for the President's visit, reach mutual understandings
                        on what we might agree to say and do, and perhaps begin shaping the outlines
                        of a communique.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there are a number of issues, each of which we recognize as
                        subsidiary but the total of which we believe would be important to symbolize
                        the new approach in our relationship. These include such matters as how we
                        could maintain contact prior to the establishment of formal diplomatic
                        relations, along the lines of some ideas that the Prime Minister mentioned
                        to me in July. There are many in America and around the world who are hoping
                        for nothing so much as the failure of the policy the Prime Minister and we
                        inaugurated in July, and some progress on some of these issues, including
                        these exchanges, would be helpful to symbolize the direction we all want to
                        go, not as a substitute for fundamental agreements but to give impetus to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Now I come to my final point which concerns the technical arrangements for
                        the President's visit. Mr. Prime Minister, on the occasion of our last
                        meeting I told you that China, despite its long experience in handling
                        outsiders, has never undergone anything like the phenomenon of a visit by an
                        American President.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d36-11" facs="d36-11"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have had the experience of
                        meeting one of the envoys of the President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But he does not move
                        with the apparatus which accompanies the President. I told the head of the
                        foreign department of the Shanghai municipality that if he didn't watch our
                        communications expert he would connect every telephone in Shanghai to the
                        White House. There is a certain single-mindedness about the technical
                        personnel that serve the President. This is the reason why they are so
                        effective, but it is not always easy for foreigners who have to experience
                        it.</p>
                    <p>When I was here last time I was ignorant about what is involved technically
                        in Presidential visits, though I had been involved in many of them. I
                        therefore asked our technical people to prepare a presentation. And when I
                        saw the numbers involved, I was shocked and asked them to prepare what they
                        would consider a minimum presentation. Even the minimum presentation still
                        involved several battalions. I therefore asked them to prepare yet another
                        one which is more in keeping with what we had in mind.</p>
                    <p>And since our technical people are extraordinarily suspicious of me—and as
                        you see, they are flanking me on both sides to be sure I don't say anything
                        wrong—I have asked them to prepare a book that outlines our requirements and
                        gives you a breakdown of what we have done in other capitals that we have
                        visited, so you can compare. This was prepared before, I must say Mr. Prime
                        Minister, I read on my way here an essay of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> on Bureaucracy; this was prepared before
                        I read that essay. But this will explain to you exactly what our people have
                        in mind and why, and it will also give you a comparison between the planning
                        for this trip and what we have done in other capitals, and you will see that
                        it is much less.</p>
                    <p>I think the technical people should discuss with our counterparts what their
                        precise problems are, rather than have me express them to you, unless you
                        have an overwhelming interest to have communications problems explained to
                        you by me.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No need for me.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: … because I don't
                        understand them myself.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d36-12" facs="d36-12"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But perhaps in this aspect I
                        have slightly a bit more knowledge than you. I have had so many experiences
                        in negotiations in my lifetime.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But let me point out
                        the basic categories of problems which they will want to discuss. The first
                        is the President's itinerary, how many days he would stay and how many
                        places you propose that he visit. And how long he would stay in each. We are
                        thinking of about five days in the People's Republic, but we are flexible in
                        listening to your suggestions.</p>
                    <p>The second problem is that of Presidential communications. Since in our form
                        of government certain decisions can be taken only by the President, there is
                        a requirement that the President has reliable, rapid, and secure
                        communications at all times.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When the President goes abroad,
                        the Vice President is not able to do his work for him?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's in the Constitution, is
                        it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. The Constitution
                        does not say anything about that. The Vice President can do the President's
                        work only when he is incapacitated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I remember when President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was Vice President to
                        President Eisenhower. But then President Eisenhower was incapacitated, I
                        believe.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is a difficult
                        question. It is very dangerous for the Vice President to declare the
                        President incapacitated, in case he recovers. And actually, Vice President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was extremely circumspect
                        at the time of President Eisenhower's heart attack and did not say he was
                        incapacitated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I have read some of the excerpts
                        of a book that he wrote, The Six Crises, that he restrained himself.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Our technical
                        people propose that the easiest way to accomplish this is by an installation
                        which would be operated by 12 people at the airport and which is connected
                        to a satellite, but I will let them discuss it with your people. Of course,
                        your people would have full access to any such installation, and could be in
                        it at all times. We have included pictures and a description of it in this
                        book, so that you can see what it is.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d36-13" facs="d36-13"/>
                    <p>The third problem about which I have already warned the Prime Minister when
                        we met is that of security for the President. I have to tell the Prime
                        Minister that the Secret Service representative of the President, who is on
                        this trip with me but who is not in this room, is barely talking to me
                        because he believes I am not taking his duty seriously, and because I am
                        assuring him that the safest place the President will ever visit is
                        Peking.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I should thank you very much for
                        your confidence in us, and this is truly something a sovereign country
                        should be able to manage. The proof of this is the recent visit of the
                        Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have no question
                        about this. There is, however, one peculiarity in our law which is that the
                        Secret Service has duties which even the President does not have the right
                        to abrogate, because the law doesn't want to give the President the right to
                        do away with his own protection. We have, in any event, reduced this,
                        because our proposal for Secret Service is frankly below the minimum they
                        consider adequate. Their function while they are here will be primarily
                        liaison with your security people and not to carry out primary security
                        functions themselves. And I suggest that perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL2">Taylor</persName> talk to whoever your counterpart
                        is here, and if there are any difficulties perhaps you would raise them with
                        me.</p>
                    <p>[<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods]</p>
                    <p>Now, let me turn to another very difficult problem which is that of the
                        press.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: [laughs] Truly there are some
                        conflicts between security, Secret Service and the press.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not as many as between
                        the press and the White House. The Prime Minister dealt with a
                        representative of the sovereign country, the New York Times.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Recently I read Mr. Lippman also
                        has issued an interview with another correspondent. Although he has already
                        retired, he seems to have a lot of interest in this thing. He was not in
                        China, though.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was afraid the Prime
                        Minister had had to deal with Walter Lippman and James Reston in one year;
                        and that is a degree of invasion no country should be required to
                        tolerate.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to tell the
                        Prime Minister, Mr. Reston granted me an interview before I left. He doubted
                        that I could perform my duties without his advice about how to treat the
                        Prime Minister. [laughter] At any rate, Mr. Prime Minister, I had never
                        considered the question of the press, and when we talked in July I mentioned
                        the figure of 10, I believe. When I asked our Press Secretary what the
                        absolute minimum was that was necessary for such a trip, he proposed a
                        figure of 250. [laughter]</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. That's because he
                        has two thousand applications. After a week of acrimonious debate, he has
                        now reduced the figure to 150, and isn't talking to me any more.</p>

                        which is almost unbelievable. [laughter]</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's in the book. About

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chapin</persName>: Between 400 and 500.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Between 400 and 500.
                        And finally the relatively easy point.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I suppose your Secret Service
                        don't agree to have so many people of the press coming?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Unfortunately, yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They have to agree. Otherwise
                        they would be cursed to death.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And then finally, as
                        for the official party, you will also find a list here. We are thinking of
                        12 members of the official party and about 16 members of the unofficial
                        party.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me tell you Mr. Prime Minister, we are here in order to prepare a
                        serious visit for a historical occasion, and we will not let any of the
                        technical issues interfere with what needs to be done. These proposals
                        reflect the best judgment of our technical people, but we require the best
                        judgment of your technical people, and if there is any problem about any of
                        these topics, I would propose, Mr. Prime Minister, that you will mention it
                        to me with the frankness with which you have always dealt with me, and we
                        will resolve it in a satisfactory manner.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This [the book] is something you
                        have officially handed over to me?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And our relations in
                        any event will not fail because of technical problems. I have more copies if
                        you would like more than one. [laughter]</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Two copies. I believe that
                        General <persName>Marshall</persName> told me in Chungking before that the
                        written plan of his landing in Normandy was up to four million or five
                        million words. I asked him “how are you going to read it?” He said “I read
                        only the outline.” [laughter] So I learned that secret from him. That is why
                        the film that your President likes to see, “Patton”. [<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That was a year ago.] So I now
                        understand the reason for that, because this General has broken through all
                        these conventions.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d36-16" facs="d36-16"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly. That was a
                        year ago.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He broke through all the rigid
                        conventions. One is rigid conventions; the other is scholasticism. I am
                        sorry to say this before you two, but this is vocational work and I respect
                        you in that because you are responsible people and to be faithful to your
                        duties you have to stick by your principles. We understand that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And you have to be kind
                        to them because they are the only two members of the White House staff still
                        speaking to me.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: General <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName> has been with the President for a
                        long time. I believe you were with him when he was Vice President?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName>: That's correct the
                        last four years of the Administration.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I hope you won't tell
                        these people everything you know about me. It would be too hard to take.

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So I admire you greatly. In this
                        aspect, we Chinese have still to catch up with you Americans because you
                        dare to use young people. You are in charge… Your counterpart here will be
                        in our protocol department and the youngest member responsible for it is
                        Miss Wang who is older than you. That doesn't matter here. You know about
                        that. But I don't ask the age of the two ladies accompanying you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And Commander Howe is a
                        submarine commander, and he works in the basement of the White House.
                        [laughter] He keeps an eye on the technical personnel from my point of view,
                        and he will attend all the technical meetings.</p>
                    <p>But to be serious about it, please tell us frankly what is possible for you
                        and what problems exist. And whatever other problems there are, we will not
                        have them about technical issues. These are all the issues I wanted to raise
                        with the Prime Minister, and it remains for me only to say that all of us
                        here and in the United States know that we are participating in an event of
                        historical significance and we are doing it with enthusiasm and dedication,
                        and every desire to start a new relationship between the United States and

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I thank you Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for giving me a very frank and
                        brief outline of the questions that you would like to discuss. And there is
                        the possibility that future meetings of this scope, sitting like this, may
                        be continued later on if necessary.</p>
                    <p>I would like to give a reply to your suggestion on the two or three general
                        categories that you would suggest for our discussions. The main purpose of
                        the interim visit is to further materialize the preparations for President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit, and therefore, the
                        questions are, first of all, divided into two main categories. The first is
                        the political issues, that is how we should go about the consultations and
                        discussions to seek the normalization of relations between our two countries
                        and exchange of opinions on matters of common interest to us. The second
                        category is the concrete discussion of the detailed technical preparations
                        to be made for the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. With regard to this part, I believe that the four
                        categories Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> just now
                        mentioned were mainly protocol, security, communications and the press. I
                        would like to ask a question, that is, after we have read the book you have
                        given to us, do you think the technical discussions should be held together
                        or separately, that is the four different aspects.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think they should be
                        held together.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I believe according to the list
                        there will be six on your side attending the technical discussions: General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName>, Mr.

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And Commander Howe, who

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would like to introduce the
                        people on our side who will take part in the technical discussions: Mr. Yu
                        Sang, Vice Minister of Public Security, (on tour of Great Hall), HAN Hsu,
                        Acting Director of Protocol, <pb n="18" xml:id="d36-18" facs="d36-18"/>and
                        Liu Ch'eng-ching, General Director of the Bureau of Communications. The
                        fifth aspect the press we have on our side, the Director of Information, Mr.
                        Ch'en Ch'u. He is also on a tour of the Great Hall. He will be attending the
                        banquet. And since you have now transferred your chief pilot from the hotel
                        at the airport to our Guest House, if he is going to participate in the
                        technical discussions we have on our side members of the CNAC (China
                        National Airways Corporation): Ma Jen-hui and Chung Jui-ai. And the main
                        interpreter will be Madame Chang. There are other interpreters assisting
                        her.</p>
                    <p>And as for the second part of the discussions, that is the technical aspects;
                        above is my reply. After they have finished reading your documents, they can
                        begin their discussions, perhaps at a date no later than tomorrow afternoon
                        because the two on your side are probably anxious to begin their work.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are professionally
                        anxious. Anxiety is their constant state.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We shall go back to the first
                        part. That's the political discussion. There is no question that on the
                        basis of the understanding we reached during the unofficial visit of yours
                        we should continue to discuss the issues that are to be discussed and are to
                        be resolved during the coming visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. With regard to the items and titles Your Excellency
                        has now put forward we have the following understanding. Taiwan, that's the
                        crucial issue with regard to the seeking of normalization between the two
                        countries, between China and the U.S. which was in the announcement; that is
                        the crucial question.</p>
                    <p>The second is that the most urgent issue to be resolved to relax tension in
                        the Far East is the question of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>The third is an issue which both our sides have a certain responsibility and
                        this responsibility, Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>, must be very familiar
                        with that; and this responsibility links us to the present day. That is

                        that in the Geneva Conference of 1954 agreement was not reached. That I
                        spoke to you about last time. Because it's an American representative of the
                        U.S. side and also a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers
                        meeting there also. On the North Korean side the main representative is the
                        representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. On the southern
                        side the main representative is the U.S. representative. So this issue
                        involves our two sides and Your Excellency mentioned this just now.</p>
                    <p>The fourth issue is the issue of Japan which is an issue which has a
                        far-reaching influence on the relaxation of tension in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>I heard that they asked you to stop over in Tokyo this time but you found it
                        impossible to do so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's what the Japanese
                        press reports.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We also saw it from the Japanese
                        news reports. This is also an issue that needs to be discussed and is
                        related to the relaxation of tension in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The fifth issue which you also mentioned is the issue of the South Asian
                        subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>The sixth issue is the point you would like to speak upon—that is relations
                        between the Soviet Union and the United States. Of course, if you are going
                        to speak on that I will have to speak on China and the Soviet Union. I did
                        not mention it last time—only one small incident—but it is something
                        mentioned very often since you left. The uniting together of various forces
                        to commit aggression against China from four sides. Of course, Your
                        Excellency answered very quickly and frankly last time that that was not
                        possible, but there are others who have not given such a direct reply, so
                        you will probably be interested in that and especially your friend from the
                        State Department. We will discuss this, but we think this is not a main
                        issue. The main issue is China and the United States. We are not opposed to
                        any other relationships.</p>
                    <p>There was another matter in which we believe there is still room for
                        improvement, another matter we are not fully satisfied with but <pb n="20" xml:id="d36-20" facs="d36-20"/>which is a part of good intentions on the
                        part of your President. That is you have proclaimed that the meeting between
                        the leaders of the United States and the leaders of the Soviet Union will be
                        after the meeting of the United States and China. Of course, this is
                        something that is done by your President along the lines of tacit agreements
                        between our two governments originally. The thing that we think there's
                        still room for improvement is that we think it would be better for your
                        President to go to the Soviet Union first. You will remember I mentioned
                        that last time. Therefore, we don't fear things at all in that aspect.</p>
                    <p>Of course, besides these issues there are other issues of mutual interest
                        that can also be discussed. I don't think there's any need to list all the
                        titles to be discussed here. In discussing these issues probably we can
                        divide ourselves into another two parties. One would be a restricted
                        discussion between a few of us. That can also be divided into two
                        categories. One of you and myself. That will be a discussion of matters of a
                        restricted nature. The other would be your friend from the State Department
                        and someone from our Foreign Ministry to discuss some general items. In this
                        way we can do things simultaneously and then we can come back to a general
                        meeting like this. Will that be all right?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me make this
                        suggestion, Mr. Prime Minister. I think it may be the best use of our time
                        if we proceed in the manner that the Prime Minister has suggested. But I
                        would like to have one assistant with me when I talk with the Prime Minister
                        and I would like perhaps to have one man watch Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> when he discusses with his colleagues in
                        the Foreign Ministry. [<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs]
                        That would be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>. In the
                        end we come back together.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Mr. Holdridge with Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. If agreeable with
                        the Prime Minister, they could discuss the list of issues I called
                        subsidiary but important and such topics that they should agree to, and the
                        Prime Minister and I and one assistant on other topics and then we will come
                        together.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We know there is also historical
                        tradition in your foreign policy and it is impossible to cut it off all at
                        once. I believe Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> will agree fully with my
                        words.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Indeed.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d36-21" facs="d36-21"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But there is also the need to
                        break with some of these conventions. On this matter President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has spoken first when he met the
                        press on the 6th of July in Kansas City.</p>
                    <p>The most interesting thing is that just before you came on this visit the
                        Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party in Britain has made a
                        speech in response to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s speech at the conclusion of the party's annual meeting.
                        And it is the Prime Minister of the Conservative Party that has acknowledged
                        the changes that have taken place in the world. On the contrary, it is he
                        who recognized the necessity to adapt themselves to the new Europe. And the
                        reaction at the meeting and outside the meeting was divided as was the
                        reaction to the July 16 announcement, the July 15 announcement, according to
                        your time. That reaction as you just now mentioned was also divided. Some of
                        the Members of Parliament of the Conservative Party were in very low spirits
                        attending that meeting. But when they heard the speech of Prime Minister
                        Heath they stood up and hailed him, that there was such a man to stand up
                        and say such words after Churchill.</p>
                    <p>Although he didn't like to do so, Mr. Churchill ended the stage of the
                        British Empire. That was not his subjective will. He said that to President
                        Roosevelt. But objectively he ended the British Empire.</p>
                    <p>And twenty-six years afterwards there has appeared the Prime Minister of the
                        Conservative Party who has actually recognized that the world has changed.
                        Of course, he has also said some good words about the United States. He said
                        that after the Second World War the U.S. acted with the generosity that
                        other countries could not do which we discussed last time and I thank you
                        for giving me the figures on lend lease.</p>
                    <p>Now the U.S. is saying that it is going to act with a new spirit and
                        therefore Britain also has to embark on its new path. Therefore there were
                        many in his party that hailed that speech. There are also some who booed his
                        speech. Therefore it shows it is not easy to change a policy. Therefore I
                        understand the reaction you just now mentioned, the reaction throughout the
                        world and in the United States after the July 15 announcement was made
                        public. And it's often the Conservative Party that dares to make the
                        changes. In the U.S. there are also evidences of this. It was President
                        Eisenhower who ended the Korean War. And it was also the ideas of Abraham
                        Lincoln that were victorious during the Civil War in the United States.
                        Isn't that so?</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d36-22" facs="d36-22"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The same situation has now
                        appeared in Britain. It's the Conservative Party which has expressed the
                        desire to join the Common Market, and it's also the Conservative Party who
                        is driving away the Soviet spies. They are willing to bear the result of the
                        cancellation of Foreign Minister Home. The same situation will appear in
                        Japan. Not with Sato. Not much help for him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My former student,
                        Nakasone?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You didn't say so last time. A
                        new discovery for me. This is also in accordance with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s thoughts. And I think that though the
                        positions; the stands of Chairman Mao and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> vary greatly, I think it would be
                        easier for them to understand and meet together. And it will be easier for
                        their ideas to meet, for them to find common ground. I am afraid the
                        interpreters cannot interpret accurately (referring to trouble Miss Tang had
                        with the words “common ground”). Even though my English is poor, I take
                        great interest in the interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I notice that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You have brought stenographers
                        with you this time, and if you have the wrong interpretation you will give
                        the wrong interpretation to the President. We have also spoken a lot of the
                        Soviet Union. We have been saying a lot about matters in the Soviet Union,
                        Great Britain, and Japan. But there's something I am very satisfied with,
                        and that is both your President and Prime Minister Heath have mentioned
                        China as a potential power. We feel that is a little above our present
                        standard. We are not an industralized nation. Of course, we are an element
                        that is promoting change in the world. And this is a factor your President
                        recognizes and Prime Minister Heath also recognizes. Of course, General
                        DeGaulle had recognized that long before. The present Prime Minister of
                        Japan, that is Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>, has
                        recognized it now but it is too late. But there's someone in his party who
                        recognizes it. But there is another who doesn't recognize it. It's always
                        that way with things in the world.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I said to your

                        25th but we will leave whenever the discussions are concluded. We just
                        wanted to leave enough time so that technical discussions and the outlines
                        of a communique will be discussed while I am here since this will be my last
                        opportunity to see the Prime Minister until the President arrives. But if
                        the work is completed earlier and we all agree it's completed then of course
                        we are very flexible about our departure. This was simply for our

                        will want to see Peking while you are here. It would not be nice if we did
                        not let you see it. There are also a lot of friends in your party who have
                        not been here before. As to what you would like to see you can put forward
                        your wishes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will leave it to you

                        it will be better for you to tell us your wishes because we are equals on
                        this matter. We are equals. The interpreter added an element “on this

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I go back, Mr.
                        Prime Minister? First, about the day of the President's visit. You are quite
                        right that you did not ask us to set the Peking date before the Soviet date.
                        Quite the opposite, in fact. But as I explained to you when we met we had to
                        complete a certain amount of work with the Soviet Union before a summit made
                        sense. If that work had been completed before my arrival in July, we would
                        have arranged the visit to the Soviet Union before the visit to Peking. But
                        when matters had developed in the direction that they had, we believed, at
                        our own initiative and not at your request, that it would be inappropriate
                        to set a date before rather than a date afterward. So we did this for
                        reasons of what we considered proper and not as a favor to the People's
                        Republic. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods.)</p>
                    <p>Secondly, incidentally, one of the topics we have to settle while I am here
                        is the precise date of the President's visit. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods.) We don't have to announce it but we should have
                        an idea because we are holding a number of dates on the President's
                        calendar.</p>

                        received from you, you have two ideas.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We proposed two dates.
                        One was February 21 and the other was March 16. We can find another date
                        within those dates if those are inconvenient.</p>

                        consideration the most important thing is to fix the date of your
                        President's visit because he probably has a very crowded schedule.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be a great
                        courtesy if we could because he has a crowded schedule and we have not
                        filled it until your response.</p>

                        I would like to say that we tend more to go for the first date toward the

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is slightly our
                        preference.</p>

                        We are also thinking of five-seven days. This is only an initial idea.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: At the end of our discussion
                        this time we will be initially finalizing the date. Of course, you will have
                        to go back and report to your President. And your colleagues can also begin
                        on their operation. The date also has to do with the weather. But I think
                        that the seasons are similar in our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The latest date in
                        March would be the 21st if it were to be in March.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's our preferred
                        date, but it's only to give you the possibility.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no worry about

                        concerns the issue of Korea. This is the second time the Prime Minister has
                        made a reference to 1954. And I would be very grateful if when we meet
                        tomorrow or on some other occasion when we meet in a large group, the Prime
                        Minister can explain exactly what he has in mind. I cannot accept in the
                        frankness of which we are talking, his description of who the most important
                        representative on the other side is in Panmunjon. I recognize that we are

                        It's not favorable to the relaxation of tensions. The State Department is

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's a very complicated matter
                        and gives one a headache.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: With respect to
                        Indochina, I will speak to the Prime Minister tomorrow. I would like to say
                        a word about Europe. I appreciate the analysis that the Prime Minister gave
                        of the speech of Prime Minister Heath, and, of course, he will remember that
                        the impetus for European unity came from the U.S. and the chief advocates
                        for European unity were American and not European. I do not doubt that many
                        of those who advocated European unity originally believed that it would be a
                        continuation of the old arrangement, only Europe would carry a bigger share
                        of the burden. But those who analyzed the problems more deeply always
                        understood that the objective necessity of a united Europe would be a
                        greater independence from the U.S. In a historical perspective this is not
                        against the interests of the U.S. There is no historic law that says Europe
                        must be governed from Washington.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, to the degree that Europe follows the policy that Prime Minister
                        Heath outlined after a short transitional period I believe that the
                        objective necessities in certain international questions are shown in
                        policy. <pb n="27" xml:id="d36-27" facs="d36-27"/>And therefore I must tell
                        the Prime Minister that Prime Minister Heath, who is a good personal friend
                        of the President and mine, did not make us at all unhappy with the speech.
                        We think it's a healthy direction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I haven't read the full text of
                        his speech but it seems to me from the extract I saw he did not talk of a
                        unified Europe in a short time. But what he was speaking of in the first
                        step was an alliance of 10 powers of Western Europe, drawing into the Common
                        Market.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That will result in grouping of
                        powers as follows: the U.S., Soviet Union, Western Europe and Japan. He
                        mentioned China for potential strength. This is basically similar with the
                        general direction of your President. I caught that point but didn't pay much
                        attention to the rest. It was difficult for him to say that in Britain.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Emotionally it was very
                        difficult. Emotionally Britain is tied to us and not Europe.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When the English speak

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I always thought it
                        curious that in 1938 Chamberlain said why should we fight for a country so
                        far away, in speaking of Czechoslovakia, after 200 years of fighting
                        thousands of miles away in India.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But in fairness one has
                        to say that the only opposition in Britain was from the Conservatives and
                        the Liberal Party was unanimously for it.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For reasons of general

                    <p>One final point I wanted to make about U.S.-Chinese relationships today, if
                        the Prime Minister will permit me. As our policy evolves toward
                        normalization of our relationship it is inevitable that some countries to
                        which we were tied will become somewhat uncertain because some patterns are
                        starting to disintegrate. Speaking for ourselves, I think as a general
                        principle it is important we do not look at the normalization of our
                        relationship as a means to drive a wedge between the People's Republic and
                        their old friends. And it would be shortsighted if either side tried to use
                        this normalization to end alliances of the other side. Because if this is
                        done there's a danger that everyone will draw back and withdraw back into
                        the rigidity we are all attempting to escape.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's one side of the matter
                        that you have mentioned. It cannot be taken absolutely. Since we are
                        entering a new era then necessarily some relationships must be changed.
                        Otherwise there would be no change and life would be as it was before. If we
                        recognize that we are entering a new era we should recognize an old proverb:
                        the helmsman who knows how to guide the boat will guide it well through the
                        waves. Otherwise he will be submerged by the waves. A far-sighted man will
                        know how to till the helm. For instance, Hangchow. The largest waves come
                        from the river, and those who know how to guide the boat are able to guide
                        the boat directly against the tide, and when they hit the peak they make a
                        turn and ride in with the tide. That's <pb n="29" xml:id="d36-29" facs="d36-29"/>a phenomenon of nature. There's also a phenomenon of
                        social affairs. If all the old relations remained unchanged how can we say
                        we are welcoming in a new era?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I did not include
                        Taiwan in this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's clear. I thought you were
                        trying to bring in subtly the question of Taiwan. I think others understand
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was talking of other
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We understand that. Including
                        your relations with the Soviet Union. We do not wish that because of your
                        new policy you will become in conflict with the Soviet Union. We want
                        relaxation of tensions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Soviet Union cannot
                        be termed as an old friend.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They are not mentioned
                        either.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will not mention any
                        particular country. Of course, when our countries are truly friendly and we
                        have gone beyond this period of caution, changes will appear in all
                        relationships. Until this point is reached we should not give those who are
                        opposed to this new direction an opportunity to say it's only a trick to
                        destroy existing relationships so that one can renew old hostilities from a
                        new tactical position, an offensive tactic rather than an attempt to achieve
                        reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean it will be a new
                        tactic?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: An offensive tactic
                        rather then an attempt at reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Anyway the times are advancing.
                        That's a very important thing. Those who can grasp the spirit of the times
                        will be able to improve the world. Otherwise they will be submerged by the
                        tides of the times as I just now mentioned.</p>

                        Toast</p>
                    <p>October 20, 1971</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and friends,</p>
                    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s special envoy Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the other American friends
                        who have come to China for this interim visit. The purpose of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s present visit is to make
                        preparations related to the political discussions and technical arrangements
                        of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit.</p>
                    <p>A new chapter will now be opened in the history of the relations between
                        China and the United States after they have been cut off for 22 years, and
                        we should say that the credit for this should go to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tsetung</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Of course, there must be someone
                        serving as a guide, and it was Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> who courageously made a secret visit to China, the
                        so-called “land of mystery”. That was quite a remarkable thing. This is now
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s second visit to a
                        land that should no longer be considered a “mystery”. He has come as a
                        friend, and has also brought with him some new friends.</p>
                    <p>As for me, although I have never been to the United States, I know quite a
                        few American friends, and the United States is not unfamiliar to me. It is
                        evident that the social systems of our two countries are different, and our
                        respective world outlooks—Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> likes to use the word “Philosophy”—are totally
                        different, yet this should not prevent us from finding common ground. The
                        Sino-American talks have gone on for 16 years now, but no common ground has
                        yet been found. Now President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        will personally come to Peking for discussions, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is his advanceman. We hope these
                        discussions will achieve positive results.</p>
                    <p>Our two peoples are great peoples. Although our two countries are separated
                        by the vast Pacific Ocean, friendship links our two peoples together. After
                        receiving the U.S. table tennis team this year, we received a number of
                        other American friends. We hope that this new era will be approached in a
                        new spirit.</p>
                    <p>I propose a toast to the friendship between the great American people and the
                        great Chinese people and to the health of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and all our other friends!</p>

                    <p>I have received two reports from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> covering the flavor of his visit thus far. He
                        stated that the discussions had been most constructive and that the
                        reception of the group could not have been more cordial.</p>
                    <p>He reported in a later message today that he has raised the issue of your
                        individual meetings with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, according to Henry, agreed reluctantly with respect to
                        his own meeting with you. On the other hand, he refused to agree to such a
                        private session with Mao despite repeated urgings by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He did so on the ground that he,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, was always present at such
                        meetings. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was unable
                        apparently to change his view. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also recommends that there be at least two
                        meetings with <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>—one at the earlier
                        part of your visit and the other towards the end.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he
                        delicately raised the issue of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s accompanying you. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> replied that while they did not initially anticipate
                        her participation in the visit, he now would be glad to take it up with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>. <persName>Henry</persName>
                        recommends that we not raise the issue again until he returns to Washington
                        and discusses it with you further. His estimate is that it can be arranged,
                        although the development of a crowd situation appears more difficult and at
                        this juncture appears unlikely.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reported that the mood
                        in all contacts thus far has been good and constructive. The agenda is
                        shaping up well and that, unless there is an unforeseen setback, the party
                        should depart Peking with an agreed communique.</p>

                    <p>DATE, TIME, PLACE:</p>
                    <p>Thursday, October 21, 1971, 10:20 a.m.- 12:15 p.m., Hupei Hall, Great Hall of
                        the People, Peking</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think if it's agreeable to you that we might
                        first take up a subject which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> of the White House staff would like to discuss
                        concerning the manner of continued communication and relations of that
                        sort.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: According to the procedure
                        agreed upon by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> yesterday, this morning
                        we are going to exchange views within this group. I suppose that we don't
                        know everyone present here. So I first will introduce those present here
                        from the Chinese side: <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Chen</persName>____________ he is Deputy Division Chief from the Western
                        European and American Department; <persName corresp="#p_JJM1">Madame</persName> ____________ [interpreter; she said “I am a staff
                        member from the Foreign Ministry"]; <persName corresp="#p_JJM1">Madame</persName> Ma [notetaker] is also a staff member from the
                        Foreign Ministry. If Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> please would you
                        introduce people from your side present at this talk.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d39-02" facs="d39-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I would be glad to have that opportunity. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> here is a senior member
                        of the National Security Council staff at the White House and has long
                        worked with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He is a
                        foreign service officer on loan to the White House and we are hoping some
                        day to get him back. And here we have Miss Pineau who is one of Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s secretaries at the
                        White House, and has worked with him for some time, and whose father I have
                        known for some time. And I have very much enjoyed getting to know her on
                        this trip.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: According to the Chinese
                        practice, we would like to hear our guests speak first. And I am very glad
                        to hear that Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> has mentioned just now that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> is going to speak
                        first. So we hope that during our talks today the United States side will
                        raise their questions and make known their ideas first.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Thank you very much. We are happy to have that
                        opportunity and I hope that as we do so you will please feel free to break
                        in at any time with any comments you may have, or questions either as to
                        procedure or substance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Exchange views.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I would like to bring up
                        if I could the question of continuing contacts between our two countries of
                        what we might call a semi-official nature. Prior to the time of full
                        normalization of relations between our two countries, we of course believe
                        it would be very useful to have contacts, so we can exchange ideas of mutual
                        interest. I think you will recall that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> discussed this last summer. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> very kindly suggested that a trusted
                        representative of the President or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> might again come to Peking and remain here for
                        several weeks, or go to other parts of China, and as the Prime Minister
                        suggested, investigate and report back. We, of course, very much appreciate
                        this offer of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>. In
                        addition, you will recall that there was a special contact which was worked
                        out between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and we are very
                        grateful for the fact that this has been established and is working very
                        well. However, it does occur to us that as our relationship grows and as our
                        contact increases, and as the preparations for the President's visit next
                        year are worked out, it might be very useful to have communications other
                        than those just discussed. There may be many things of an administrative
                        nature which we would like to take care of and which we would not like to
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d39-03" facs="d39-03"/>burden our more high-level
                        contacts with. So I would simply like to raise a number of possibilities,
                        and would like to stress that these are simply possibilities which I would
                        like to offer for your consideration. We have noticed, for example, that the
                        People's Republic of China and the Government of Japan maintain liaison
                        offices. We know this is in the context of trade, but would like to raise
                        the possibility—on a reciprocal or on a unilateral basis—of establishing an
                        office having diplomatic status, but not full diplomatic status, with the
                        ability to communicate, use the diplomatic pouch, and use crypto
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>'s Interpreter: [indicated
                        confusion]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Cryptographic systems.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: There is one point not quite
                        true to the fact mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> just now. There isn't any such contacts between
                        the Chinese and Japanese governments and there isn't any liaison office.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I though that was in
                        connection with trade.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What liaison office you
                        mentioned is between the peoples, an unofficial trade office. We can explain
                        this later. Not between the governments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I don't want to belabor
                        the point. Let me move on to another possibility.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: You say you don't believe in
                        this point?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: No, I said I don't want to
                        belabor this point.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I am not going to make any
                        comments on suggestions you mention now. I have just clarified a point.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I appreciate that, and
                        think it is probably more practical not to go into details. I just wanted to
                        review some of the suggestions we had in mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: May I make one brief comment on this before we
                        leave it. As I understand, we don't have anything very definite in mind, but
                        while we are not necessarily picturing anything of a materially different
                        nature organizationally from the Japanese “Trade Office,” I believe to call
                        it a trade office is not what we had in mind. “Trade Office” is more a
                        special indicator than the precise format we had in mind. Isn't that
                        right?</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Excuse me; I must make a break
                        here. [Photographers enter.] The photographers are very aggressive. He wants
                        to take a photo of me. Might we let him in?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Some time we might have a friendly competition
                        as to which are more aggressive, American or Chinese photographers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Do you have also this
                        custom?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: With a vengeance.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: [Indicated he didn't
                        understand.]</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: [Explained with Chinese
                        expression chueh tui, meaning emphatically.]</p>
                    <p>Laughter</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: But they didn't know it in
                        advance, so after they have learned if they want to put in.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: This often happens in our circumstances
                        too.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: So we have to agree to it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: This I understand fully.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: And, of course, as Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also mentioned
                        yesterday, some of the pictures can also be given to you.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Very short one. Although it is
                        short, but I believe you would like to get it.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We would prize it very much.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Because Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned it twice yesterday.
                        Perhaps it is not well taken.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I am sure it is very good.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: They [the photographers] want
                        to continue. I am sure it won't be good by 70 percent.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think they always take a great deal more
                        footage than they end up using. At least that's the way our people do
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I would like to add a few
                        words on the suggestions which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> mentioned just now, first suggestion. I am not
                        going to give a reply on the suggestion itself which has been put forward,
                        by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> just now. I am just
                        going to clarify a fact. That is, there isn't such a liaison office between
                        the Chinese and Japanese governments. As to what is going to be done between
                        the Chinese and United States governments, we can give further
                        considerations; we can exchange views. I am not going to comment on your
                        suggestion itself. Perhaps you understand it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Let me proceed and offer
                        another possibility if I may. I am sure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> is aware in the Middle East, for example, of American
                        interest sections inside friendly embassies, such as in the UAR, Algeria,
                        and so on. [to <persName>Jenkins</persName>]: Isn't it at the Spanish
                        Embassy …</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: At the Spanish Embassy in
                        Cairo as an example, and of course the countries such as the UAR can also be
                        in the United States in Washington, D.C. in the same fashion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: They haven't restored the
                        United States embassy in Cairo?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: No, our representative is
                        simply an American interest representative. He has the personal rank of
                        Minister and is accorded diplomatic status, but we do not have formal
                        representation in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Actually, he operates from our regular embassy
                        quarters there. He is not housed in the Spanish Embassy, but he is
                        technically a section of the Spanish Embassy. But that's a matter of mutual
                        convenience, and need not be a pattern for other cases. These patterns vary
                        considerably.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d39-06" facs="d39-06"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: So this is another
                        possibility which we offer for the consideration of the People's Republic.
                        We assume we would have to find a friendly embassy. Of course, we would also
                        offer this on a reciprocal basis if that would be the preference of the
                        People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>One third possibility comes to mind, and that is simple reverting to what
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said, a senior
                        representative of the President or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> coming to Peking again. It might be helpful for a
                        small group, perhaps from the American Consulate General in Hong Kong, to
                        come in advance of the representatives's trip, be here before his arrival,
                        during his stay here, and remain after. It would be helpful in
                        administrative matters. Of course the people I am talking about need not
                        come from Hong Kong; they can come from any other convenient place, or from
                        Washington for that matter.</p>
                    <p>Now these are three possibilities which occur to us, and they certainly do
                        not in any way supplant the suggestion which Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> raised with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> last summer, which we are very
                        grateful for. And we welcome any suggestions from the People's Republic of
                        China or any suggestions that you might care to make.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: This is one point, one
                        question. Any other questions? Shall we link them together? Shall we hear
                        your questions, all the points first?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Related to this subject or to our next
                        subject?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: If there is any addition to
                        these points, we would like to hear about it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: That is all I have to talk
                        about at this point concerning continuing contacts. What Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> has to discuss is rather unrelated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Then Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName>, please speak.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes. I think as our affairs progress in these
                        prior visits—what your Prime Minister referred to last night as this interim
                        visit to the President's visit—that we are hoping we can approach these
                        matters between us sort of organismically, as a whole. I myself am
                        particularly cognizant of this turning point, this really quite historical
                        occasion. I was impressed, and I must say moved, yesterday and particularly
                        last evening. I have presumed to inject a slight personal note into this
                        because I have been associated with the lengthy Warsaw Talks pretty much
                        since their inception, their beginning in 1955, and their preliminaries in
                        1954, and during that <pb n="7" xml:id="d39-07" facs="d39-07"/>period it
                        seem that we were, as someone put it, like ships passing in the night.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: During the Warsaw Talks you
                        frequently attended?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, I was advisor to the Talks during the
                        time that I was Deputy Chief of Mission at our American Embassy in
                        Stockholm. I went to the talks 17 times then.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: You are a very frequent
                        traveler. But as it was mentioned in our Prime Minister's speech, although
                        we carried on our talks 16 years, nothing has come out of it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That's true. We were like ships passing in the
                        night. But I maintained a bit of hope then, because the tradition of humor
                        between the Chinese and American people, which I think is similar, would
                        come out even during these trying times. Even when no substantive agreements
                        could be reached, we would day “Ah, we have agreed on one point, the date of
                        the next meeting.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: This I think is not a question
                        of a sense of humor. It's a very serious question. And just now, Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> said you greet this as a turning point. How
                        did you think prior to this turning point? How did you think of Sino-U.S.
                        relations?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think it was painful to both sides because
                        we were cognizant of some misunderstandings and misconceptions perhaps, but
                        primarily because of different circumstances in East Asia and in the world
                        it may have been difficult for us to be other than ships passing in the
                        night. Whereas now, fortunately, we are not like ships passing in the night,
                        but people meeting in broad daylight and have had the openness and frankness
                        which has been so abundantly demonstrated by your Prime Minister and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and our President, and
                        we find it a very refreshing thing that we seem to be meeting in daylight
                        now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: If we take this ship as an
                        analogy, then whether it sails at night or in the daylight, you will need a
                        direction, an orientation. For without a fixed orientation then even if you
                        sail in the daylight then you sail to the wrong course.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> is exactly right in that point, and I think this is
                        an appropriate introduction to what I hope to take up now.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d39-08" facs="d39-08"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: That's why I am not going to
                        make any comments on Sino-U. S. talks which have lasted 16 years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Pai tse-ti (without
                        results).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Exactly. I think we have fully recognized that
                        the People's Republic considers some of these questions which you have
                        called 'subsidiary' as precisely that, and I want to emphasize we do not
                        intend to use these issues as any sort of diversion from what we both
                        consider to be the fundamental issues. I believe that our principals are
                        facing some of the fundamental issues, and expect us concurrently to look at
                        some of the things which will help make movement possible on these
                        fundamental questions—which can help us, I know, and possibly you in the
                        People's Republic, to convince those who would detract from our present
                        course that acceptable movement is possible and can be mutually
                        profitable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What do you mean by condemning
                        those who want to divert the attention of these questions?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: You say condemning? I mean detracting. Last
                        night Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned quite
                        frankly that there are elements in our society which have questions, or more
                        than questions, about the direction in which our present efforts are going.
                        It isn't easy to cope with that. We believe that it can be done, but we
                        believe that some agreement in these subsidiary issues to the fundamental
                        issues, which are also to be faced, show we attach no conditions to progress
                        in relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: There have been some
                        leading people in the United States who have criticized the turn of events,
                        say this will harm U.S. relations with other countries, and these voices are
                        quite powerful still. I am sure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> is aware of some of the people who have spoken out.
                        They are quite influential indeed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: And therefore if we can point to some
                        particular movement on these substantive issues, for us at least it will be
                        something of an insurance policy that can be applied to movement in some of
                        the more fundamental questions. I have here quite a number of purely
                        suggestive proposals, some of which may appeal to the People's Republic and
                        we will offer them as possibilities for your consideration. They are not
                        exclusive. We would certainly welcome any suggestions and observations from
                        you and I would like to review a few of them orally, and then perhaps offer
                        you some written material which you may like to study and refer to later.
                        Due to the multi-faceted…</p>

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I have met that hazard before.</p>
                    <p>It is frankly difficult for us to picture just the best mechanics for
                        approaching such matters as precise contacts in scientific, cultural, and
                        sports areas. For us it would unquestionably be easier, simpler, and perhaps
                        more reliable and managable if there were some type of
                        government-to-government arrangement concerning them. However, if the
                        People's Republic prefers to handle such matters on a non-governmental
                        basis, through private organizations, people's organizations, that would be
                        thoroughly acceptable to us. If there were to be a government-to-government
                        agreement, I am sure that we could work together on the format for such. If,
                        however, it is to be carried on through peoples' organizations on a private
                        basis, we might simply prefer, both of us, to carry a reference to that
                        effect in a joint communique. Unless there is some comment on this that you
                        would care to make at this point, I could proceed to just mention briefly
                        several illustrative possibilities along this line, and as I earlier said, I
                        could give you some written possibilities which you might want to study in
                        further detail and comment upon.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Yes, please proceed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: As an example, we have heard, particularly in
                        recent times in the United States, of some rather remarkable techniques that
                        you have derived in China concerning the treatment of severe burn victims
                        and also for retaining severed limbs. There may also be areas of surgical
                        practice in the United States which would interest Chinese specialists. If
                        you should find any interest in this area, we are prepared to arrange
                        invitations for Chinese visitors to leading hospitals and specialty surgical
                        clinics in the United States. As I have said, we believe that we could learn
                        from you in this area to the benefit of our people in these humanitarian
                        endeavors, in the saving of life; and if this were to be done on a
                        governmental level we would suggest that our National Institutes of Health
                        would be willing to cooperate in this field. If it is done on a private
                        basis perhaps the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences,
                        which is not a governmental organization, might be of help.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I believe so. You probably

                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: As a second, again purely illustrative idea
                        which occurs to us, we have noted that your Premier has personally mentioned
                        the Chinese concern for protection of the environment and the natural
                        ecology of the planet. This is a very topical question today. I think
                        particularly the youth of the world are very vocal on this subject, although
                        all of us are having to take it with increasing seriousness. The United
                        States is very cognizant of the fact that the highly industrialized
                        countries have a particular responsibility in trying to do whatever they can
                        to reduce pollution and unfavorable effects on the environment, because our
                        planet has in a sense shrunken, so that in effect what any of us does
                        affects the others.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I remember in one of his
                        speeches, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made
                        special emphasis on the question of pollution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, so on this subject, both of our
                        leaderships in the two countries are openly expressing concern. Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> has spoken of
                        this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: [laugh] The situation of
                        pollution in Japan is no better than in the United States.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Worse.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Perhaps it is more
                        serious.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: It is much worse.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Many friends, the people of
                        Japan, in Japan you can hardly find any fish in the lake now. And the Danube
                        in Europe you can hardly find any fish now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d39-11" facs="d39-11"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: It has also much to do with
                        the social system.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Partly. It has also to do
                        with size of the society, number of people, and degree of industry in
                        certain areas.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I mean the social system. But
                        we won't debate on this subject.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Even though we agree not to debate that
                        question, I can say that we have witnessed that the Chinese have set a
                        remarkable example for other nations in the recovery and recycling of a wide
                        variety of waste materials, that is both industrial and, shall we say,
                        societal wastes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Yes, we make full use of the
                        three kinds of waste materials, waste gas, waste water, and waste
                        materials.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We have seen articles on this and have been
                        very much impressed by them. Air pollution, water pollution, waste recovery
                        and recycling and, just as importantly, sanitary engineering are areas of
                        much interest to us. We believe that you can help us in these areas, and we
                        would hope that that might also be mutual.</p>

                        recent times have had quite a rapid growth of interst in organic farming in

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Of course this is also

                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: A lot. We are using a
                        great deal in places like Iowa to increase corn yield per acre of land. We
                        have a great corn yield because of this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What kind [of fertilizer]?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: For the most part
                        nitrogenous.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Chemical.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes. But one has to be very careful in using
                        fertilizers. To increase the amount can kill crops unless some other
                        measures are taken concommitantly.</p>
                    <p>We could, if you are interested, provide a collection of, I should think,
                        several hundred technical reports of our office of saline water on studies
                        related to development of water desalinization techniques. We could also
                        furnish you, if you would like them, our latest information on air and water
                        quality standards. [<persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> indicates
                        he doesn't understand.] I believe what's meant by that is safe levels of the

                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes. Various means of helping each other in
                        this field are possible. One thing which occurs to us is a Dr. Abel Wolman
                        who is the Professor of Sanitary Engineering at Johns Hopkins University,
                        would be prepared to visit China if you would like him, to learn from you
                        and also lecture here on some of his studies, if you would wish that. That's
                        just an illustrative suggestion, an example. One possible means of contact
                        from our side in this whole area of interest would be our National Academy
                        of Sciences.</p>

                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: In Washington. Many of our organizations which

                        to have further attention put to it would be very useful, and might be
                        something of interest to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Have you solved the problem of
                        translating English to French or Spanish by computers?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Again, not perfectly, but surprisingly well. I
                        have read printouts of French and Russian translations into English and the
                        sense is almost complete and rather accurate. The grammar sometimes, word
                        order and construction, sometimes leaves a good bit to be desired. It at
                        times sounds a bit childish, but the ideas are there.</p>
                    <p>I don't want to overdo this oral presentation, but there are two or three
                        other things if I may continue a little longer. I don't know what you <pb n="14" xml:id="d39-14" facs="d39-14"/>plan as to our schedule, as to
                        whether we sould probably break and come back—whatever your pleasure is.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: As I mentioned at the
                        beginning, according to our Chinese practice, we like to have our guests to
                        speak first. If we can't finish it in the morning we can find some other
                        time, wither in the afternoon or some other time to continue it.</p>
                    <p>[BREAK: 11:35 - 11:45]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I have mentioned several areas in which China
                        seems to form something of a vanguard …</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> Interpreter: [indicates
                        confusion]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: leader. There is an area which I am sure is of
                        considerable interest to both of our countries because of our long
                        coastlines in which, if I am not being immodest, I think the United States
                        has made considerable advance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Your coastline is longer than
                        ours because you have them on both sides.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, but I think you catch more fish than we
                        do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Because of your pollution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: This area that I am speaking of is in marine
                        science work. We believe that our work in that field is of high quality and
                        certainly of very broad coverage. We are prepared to encourage the three
                        major American west coast oceanographic institutions to host a delegation of
                        Chinese oceanographers and marine scientists for disucssion of areas of
                        common interest if this would appeal to you.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of other ideas in here which to me seem so attractive that
                        I am loathe to skip over them, but in the interest of time I will perhaps go
                        to only one more at the moment and. we can discuss other later if you wish.
                        I mentioned earlier Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s expressed interest in environmental problems. I
                        recall also that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has
                        written a poem about a particularly troublesome disease. We frankly know
                        very little about your efforts in the field of control of schistosomiasis,
                        but we have seen artilces which interest us, and we have done some study on
                        the subject. <pb n="15" xml:id="d39-15" facs="d39-15"/>One possibility for
                        consideration would be some sort of cooperative research program in this
                        field. We could provide samples of experimental drugs with full test data
                        which we have obtained to date in this area of research.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Are there many cases of
                        schistosomiasis in the United States?</p>
                    <p>Jenkins: No, it's almost non-existant. However, in our aid and other
                        interests in some other countries in the world, I believe in South America
                        and—I am not sure of this, but perhaps in Africa—we have been requested to
                        give what help we can in this area, and we are interested in the problem. We
                        have done some work in immunology and also in test procedures for
                        identifying the presence of the disease.</p>
                    <p>I think perhaps I should stop here in reviewing specific suggestions. This
                        will illustrate some of the suggestions we have been thinking about and
                        perhaps I can pass to you some papers with a longer list of suggestions you
                        may want to look over and comment on later. It seems that I have spent our
                        time so far on scientific matters. We also have cultural, athletic, and
                        journalistic suggestions here, and I would not slur these. I don't mean that
                        we are emphasizing one area over another. It just happens that I got started
                        talking about some of these rather fascinating subjects, and have not gotten
                        to the others, but we can do so if you would wish.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Personally, I would like
                        rather to listen to what you have got to say than to read them. Of course,
                        if you would like to hand over these very thick pieces of long lists, I
                        would also like to read it over. I would like to know if you have covered
                        all the points you would like to raise.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I have not covered all the points in this
                        paper, simply illustrative ones, and if you wish I can go on. I think these
                        (pointing to the papers) present it quite well and it is up to you whether
                        you would like to go over it orally now or like to look this over and return
                        to them later. And if you have any questions or observations on your part,
                        we would certainly like to receive them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Of course, we have covered
                        some secondary points, if we may quote what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> used the term, subsidiary points. What I mean is,
                        are there any other main points you want to make? Because this morning we
                        have touched on questions of contacts between our two countries, and also
                        cultural and scientific topics. Are there any other main points?</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d39-16" facs="d39-16"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I believe not this morning. These were the
                        main points on our mind. If there are any other points you would like to
                        discuss we would be interested in knowing that, aid would perhaps return to
                        these later. I believe that our principals plan to take up, of course, other
                        issues when they meet.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Within this scope, are these
                        the only two points which the United States side would like to put
                        forward?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: These are the two which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wished us to take up this
                        morning. If there are other ideas you would like to discuss, we are prepared
                        to discuss anything of interest to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What I mean is your side. Are
                        there any other main points? Any points you would put forward later?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: There are a number of things we could talk
                        about. I don't know to what extent you wish to talk about possible increase
                        in trade for instance. But we could possibly talk about that at a later
                        time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: First of all, we would like to
                        know the views of the United States side, see what points you would like to
                        make.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: As for this session, I think these are the two
                        main points we had contemplated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: If so, then there are two
                        approaches: one is we will read it over first, and then we can exchange
                        views. Another approach is we will not read it over but we will ask you to
                        cover all these points which are contained in these lists.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I am quite prepared to do whichever you wish.
                        It is immaterial to us. I can continue talking if you wish, or it might be
                        useful for you to get an overview and spend more time later on those topics
                        which you wish to cover more fully.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Then we can consider how to
                        carry on our talks in this session. Either we read it over first, and fix a
                        time to make an exchange of views later, or we can meet again this afternoon
                        and you will tell us all the points covered in this list.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: It is perfectly agreeable to us to do it
                        either way, however, I suggest if it's agreeable to you it might be useful
                        for you to have this list and look it over, and we will return whenever you
                        set a time.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d39-17" facs="d39-17"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Then our exchange of views
                        this morning will soon finish. And of course, I believe that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> you will know very well the whole process
                        of Sino-American ambassadorial talks, and also the consistent stand of the
                        Chinese side. That's why I am not going to make any comments on any of the
                        possibilities you have raised just now. I will make more comments next time
                        we have a session.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I understand. That's perfectly agreeable to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I think it would be better for
                        me to make clear in advance that we believe you know very well the Chinese
                        government's consistent fundamental stand. The Warsaw Talks have lasted for
                        16 years, and of course we can further make clear our views. Of course, if
                        there is any other point you would like to put forward, we are ready to
                        listen.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Thank you very much for your attention this
                        morning. I think both sides have talked so often in the past that we both
                        have understandings of each other's long held positions, but as our
                        principals discussed, at this turning point the necessity is not only to
                        base things on the realities of the past and present, but to learn from that
                        in order to change the future ofor the better.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: That's all for this
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Very well. If I may offer these three copies
                        to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: As for the program for this
                        afternoon, our protocol office will exchange views with you and. ask your
                        opinion about that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That sounds very promising.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Take some visits to some
                        places, or you may take a rest if you like.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Probably prudence would call for a little
                        rest, but for my part, I have such an interest in this capital city that I
                        would really like to see something of it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: In this regard, we respect
                        your opinion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That's very kind.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>

                        receive any phone calls and wanted our Foreign Ministry to receive them for
                        you and give you the message. Otherwise, you couldn't sleep.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wish I had this in

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's very windy today and so not
                        convenient for you to go to the Great Wall. We'll wait for a better day.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As the Prime Minister
                        knows, I went to school in Boston and there the wind is always bad and never
                        changes after it's bad. No southerly wind in Boston.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is always
                        beautiful and warm.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Washington?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Washington is warmer
                        than Boston. It rains but never snows.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No snow?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Almost never, but when
                        it comes there's complete paralysis.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Sometimes I heard it snows in
                        Washington but in New York there's more snow, and when there's snow every
                        family is busy sweeping snow from the sidewalks.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's true especially
                        in the suburbs. The rate of heart attacks increases with the snow.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: People shovel their
                        driveways and forget their age.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They want to shovel away the
                        snow rapidly. Let's begin our work. First, I will again ask Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to start.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, we
                        have two categories of problems which I thought we would discuss in this
                        restricted meeting. One has to do with—which we can settle fairly
                        quickly—certain arrangements for the President's visit, such as the number
                        of meetings he should have with the Prime Minister and the Chairman, and how
                        these meetings should be conducted. <pb n="3" xml:id="d40-03" facs="d40-03"/>The second and most important purpose is to discuss a number of issues
                        such as Taiwan, Soviet Relations, and Indochina and the UN which I did not
                        want to share with colleagues not in my own office. And if there's time, I
                        could also cover with the Prime Minister the situation in South Asia in this
                        meeting, but it does not have to be. It can be covered in a larger meeting.
                        It's easier in this meeting but not essential.</p>
                    <p>In what order would the Prime Minister like to discuss these issues? Would he
                        like to discuss the technical ones first? They are fairly quick. Or would he
                        like to discuss the substantive ones first?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, we can start with the
                        technical questions because in the afternoon our technical personnel will
                        meet, so it's good to lay a basis for it now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                        indicated to me yesterday, for tentative planning purposes, that of the two
                        dates, February 21 is the easier. I want to say that if a date earlier in
                        February is better for the Chinese side, we could consider February 14. We
                        slightly prefer the 21st, but not enough to make any difference.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As I said yesterday, we have
                        tentatively agreed that the visit may start on the 21st. And since you also
                        prefer the date of 21st of February, and prefer it over the 14th of
                        February, I think we may not change it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Unless, of course, in the future
                        either your side or our side has a particular reason for advancing the date
                        or postponing it, in which case it must be agreed upon through liaison.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We should decide when
                        we will announce the date because there will be great speculation when I
                        return.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. We can decide that
                        towards the end of the visit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No need to do it
                        now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because for you, as you are
                        advancing the date of the President's coming, you must announce the date,
                        particularly for your technical personnel you must, because before the
                        President's visit they will pay us another visit. So it's not possible to go
                        in general terms.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d40-04" facs="d40-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly. Did the Prime
                        Minister actually read the whole book last night? If so, I must
                        apologize.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I studied in the method used by
                        General <persName>Marshall</persName>. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For the conduct of the
                        meetings when the President visits the People's Republic, we would like them
                        conducted on the same basis as these meetings: that is, a general session;
                        and then perhaps the President could have meetings with the Prime Minister
                        and the Secretary of State could have meetings with whomever you designate,
                        perhaps the Foreign Minister; and then after these sessions, they could meet
                        in a general session.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. As for the general
                        session, would we include only the official members of the delegation or
                        also the unofficial members? The official members are twelve. I suppose
                        those taking part would be the official.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not every member of the
                        official group. For example, Rose Mary Woods, who is a secretary, would not
                        attend official meetings. Mr. <persName>Chapin</persName> would not attend,
                        and probably Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HTL2">Hughes</persName> would not attend. And if
                        I have anything to do with it, the Press Secretary will not attend. This
                        will be an easy way for the Prime Minister to determine my influence.
                        (laughter) My philosophy is that what the Press Secretary doesn't know, he
                        can't reveal to the press.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is right. I agree to your
                        principle. But whether it can be realized all depends on the President.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is true.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's indeed not easy to be an
                        American President. He must look into everything.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the Press Secretary
                        attends, however, I will personally terrorize him to be sure there will be
                        no leaks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Before we arrive at a
                        finalization of any arrangement it is better not to release it. That is our
                        custom.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I can guarantee it.

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the private meetings
                        on our side it would be the President and myself, and maybe one aide, but
                        maybe not. And it might be useful if on one occasion, for some limited
                        period of time, the President could meet alone with the Prime Minister
                        without aides, except interpreters, as there are many private views that
                        they want to exchange. But for the major part of the substantive work in the
                        private meetings, I will be with the President.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would like to express an
                        opinion on the question of the talks which the technical people might or
                        might not discuss this afternoon. I would hope that the President would be
                        able to meet with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> at an
                        earlier date during the visit, either with a large group or privately; that
                        is, first for the Chairman to meet with the party, including the Secretary
                        of State and others, and then for the Chairman to have a meeting restricted
                        to the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>,
                        or only the President. That might be more conducive to settling questions.
                        It is also more likely that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> might take part in these since regardless the
                        Chairman will want me to take part because in this way the questions could
                        be discussed more directly and in a more deep-going way.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You recommend early in
                        the visit? Maybe the first or second day?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Not the first day. There are a
                        lot of formalities on the first day.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But, for instance, if the visit
                        is to take five days, it would be good if the meeting with the President
                        takes place on the second or third day, but I haven't discussed this with
                        the Chairman. Your plan says the fifth day.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It was done by
                        technical people who don't understand. I am in charge of the meetings, but
                        they put something down to fill the schedule. They have no authority to
                        schedule meetings.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's good to make it clear.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In fact, they shouldn't
                        discuss it this afternoon. Let the Prime Minister and I discuss this. Just
                        block out the times for substantive meetings and then the Prime Minister and
                        I will decide who meets whom in that time period.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with the Prime
                        Minister, if he proposes this, that the Chairman and President should meet
                        very early in the President's visit.</p>

                        the visit. If the visit is five days, then the latest is the third day.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If the President's visit can be
                        seven days, then we will have more time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are flexible about
                        the length. Not the technical people necessarily.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you think it's
                        better to have six or seven days, I am sure the President will agree.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I believe, as the Prime
                        Minister does, if the Chairman and President could meet early, say no later
                        than the third day, then they could make fundamental decisions on where we
                        should go.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If I may make a
                        technical suggestion about the meetings between the President and Chairman
                        Mao from the psychology of the President; if I can speak in the frankness
                        with which I always speak to you, it might be most effective if the
                        President and Chairman could meet alone for half an hour to become
                        acquainted, and then I will join them for the substantive discussion. This
                        is entirely up to you. We can do it any way you think it's most effective.
                        It's simply a suggestion based on how the President has conducted other
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: All right. I may repeat this
                        suggestion to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> because the
                        Chairman is accustomed to having someone else around to ask specific
                        matters, particularly myself. As for matters of principle, <pb n="7" xml:id="d40-07" facs="d40-07"/>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has considered them over and over again already. That is
                        why, as I said at the banquet last night, I hope we will turn a new page in
                        the new era.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was very moved last
                        night, and we will attempt to move in the same spirit and in the same
                        attitude. Another possibility is that—I don't know whether one or two
                        meetings are envisaged between the Chairman and President—but before he
                        leaves can he call on Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> to
                        say goodbye?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But generally speaking Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> doesn't care for these
                        protocol matters. My impression is that as far as I know the American
                        President is more liberal with regard to protocol matters than other heads
                        of state.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: For instance, President
                        Roosevelt received Ambassadors and heads of state of other countries
                        anywhere, not necessarily in Washington. We appreciate this practice very
                        much and we will try to do this ourselves. Before we learned from the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are the most
                        protocol-conscious people I know.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They inherited it from the
                        Czarist days. During the time of Lenin that was not the case, nor during the
                        early days of Stalin. It was after the Stalin era.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have been struck with
                        the ease of the relationship of the people in the People's Republic which I
                        have not found in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They are extremely tense. At the
                        beginning, after our liberation, we learned from the Soviet Union; also, a
                        strange thing, we wanted to learn from the English. The man who was
                        responsible for protocol matters after liberation had the old manners. He
                        wanted a red carpet to go down right to the gateway. In a new era old
                        conventions should be broken down. You can be certain that the meeting
                        between the President and Chairman will not be one meeting.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For the meetings
                        between the President and the Chairman you arrange them in a way that is
                        most effective to you. It's such an historical occasion, and you know the
                        principal parties. We should arrange them in the most effective way, and the
                        way you suggested that you attend on your side and I on our side will be
                        most acceptable. We accept your proposal.</p>

                        are studying Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have many who speak
                        Chinese, but they also speak to newspapers. (laughter)</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's hard to blame them because
                        that's the system in your country. They are bound to have some subsidiary
                        occupations in your country. Any more technical matters?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On technical matters,
                        then, is this outline roughly agreeable to you, Mr. Prime Minister? We meet
                        in the afternoons, leaving out who meets with whom?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, we agree to that
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Before we leave—we
                        don't have to do it now—we will prepare an alternative for five days and an
                        alternative for seven days.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, you may make two
                        alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the visit to other
                        cities, did I understand the Prime Minister correctly at dinner last night
                        that he will accompany the President on these trips?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There's no question about
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So in fact on the
                        airplane there could be talks also?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, certainly. I have
                        accompanied heads of state and governments of many countries, and I have
                        talked with them. They started with our American friend, General
                            <persName>Marshall</persName>. While on the plane we talked
                        endlessly.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Also, is the idea that
                        the President will spend the night in towns he visits or return here?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's up to you. If you find it
                        necessary you can have the President come back and spend the night in
                        Peking, but it's more comfortable (to spend the night away). It's up to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem is that
                        more people will have to come in here, and I have tried to keep the invasion
                        to a minimum. Not so much for security, but for communications.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If he stays overnight in another
                        city it's strictly for rest, but restricted meetings can be held there.
                        Hangchow is rather suitable for that. It is very quiet. There are villas
                        there and winter equipment is good there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you do not object to
                        the few additional people who will be necessary, I think we can agree to
                        that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It doesn't matter. There are now
                        351 in the party. It would be better not for all of them (to go).</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Some correspondents are bound to
                        go, and we will look after it. There are plenty of things to do for them in
                        Hangchow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you lose the
                        correspondents in Manchuria, we will be grateful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will take care of them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We regret that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will take care of them for
                        sightseeing and eating and take care of themselves. One thing more difficult
                        to satisfy—that is on the question of TV. Our receiving capabilities for TV
                        are not good. For instance, we cannot get broadcasts in Hangchow from other
                        places.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is no problem for
                        us. The problem our technical people have is whether you will permit them to
                        install the ground station so that they can transmit back to Washington.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is a matter for them to
                        discuss this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. We don't
                        care what your own receiving capabilities are here in China. That is of no
                        concern to us. And this will not affect our decisions where to go.</p>
                    <p>You will see on this list I didn't include myself in the traveling party
                        because I didn't know whether the Prime Minister would go with us, and I
                        thought I would have to stay behind to work on a communique or such matters,
                        but if the Prime Minister goes, I will go also.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will discuss this in the
                        other cities together.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then I will be in the
                        traveling party.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is good.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As far as the airplane
                        is concerned, the President has never traveled in any plane other than his,
                        and therefore we should leave that question open and let me discuss it
                        personally with the President, because our technical people here have no
                        authority to make this arrangement to travel in a Chinese plane.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, you may discuss that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will discuss it with
                        the President because I understood the Prime Minister yesterday that while
                        in China we will travel in a Chinese plane.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's correct.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One thing would make it
                        easier, and that is if the Presidential plane, without the President, could
                        come to the same city in case there's an emergency and a need for
                        communications, because it has the best communications. That is, if the
                        President travels in a Chinese plane, which I frankly will recommend.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You may not only come in a
                        Boeing 707; you may also fly to China a slower plane in speed for landing.
                        What is the length of the runway required? It's also possible to fly a plane
                        that is like the Ilyushin.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d40-12" facs="d40-12"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that the Boeing
                        can land at Hangchow. The President's plane requires 5000 feet.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then it is a question of
                        necessary facilities. The length of the runway in Hangchow might meet that
                        requirement. There is a question of the facilities for landing, but we have
                        at least three and a half months.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will discuss it with
                        the President, and we will decide it in a manner that most meets your
                        needs.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have so many
                        substantive problems, we will not have technical problems. That is our
                        spirit and they will be solved in that attitude.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Right. Mutual trust and mutual
                        respect. These two points.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is all I have on
                        technical matters. One other silly, technical matter which is that it would
                        be helpful if before I leave here we could have a preliminary understanding
                        of what should be in the communique and what not, so the visit is free of
                        discussions that can be avoided.</p>

                        whomever he designates. It's premature right now. After we have had some

                        probably be better only after we have a general discussion and in a
                        restricted meeting. I agree then we can discuss what should be in it and

                        the subject of the normalization of relations and Taiwan. I would like to
                        sum up what is my recollection of what I told the Prime Minister when we met
                        in July. I told the Prime Minister that we would withdraw the forces on

                        the war in Indochina. I said that we would reduce the other forces
                        progressively over a somewhat longer period of time and faster if our
                        relations improved.</p>

                        a final date.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is correct. We
                        understand the evolution we are aiming for. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods) I said that we are not advocating a two-China

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Is it likely to realize a
                        situation of one China and two governments as put forward by the State
                        Department? I have thought a lot about it. That is why we directed our
                        spearhead of criticism to the State Department and Mr. Bush. But we didn't
                        direct our criticism at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                        after he put forward this proposition in the name of your government. Only
                        in our press. Only after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                        put it forward did we put forward a foreign ministry statement on 20
                        August.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We noted your statement
                        and truly you used restraint, and I will say a word about it in a minute.
                        You have showed great restraint in what is for both of us a very difficult
                        situation. I will explain it in a minute.</p>
                    <p>I said that we wouldn't support or encourage the creation of an Independent
                        Taiwan Movement. If you have any information that any American, official or
                        unofficial, is encouraging such a movement, I understand that you will
                        inform us and you have our promise that it will be stopped. We will oppose
                        —</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: To the best of my
                        knowledge it had no encouragement from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        government, and I am not aware of the fact that it was a world-wide plan.
                        However, I will look into it when I get back, and I will inform the Prime

                        so-called Taiwan independence started with the convening of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in New York, and there was a series of

                        Japan and even extending to Taiwan, and they are continuing. And I can send

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you will send me the

                        you the result of our investigation, but I can assure you we are giving no

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As I told the Prime

                        they are always thought of.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is true, and it

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is technically under the White House.
                        Technically, before they engage in the sort of operation the Prime Minister
                        refers to, they have to make a request to a committee of which I am chairman
                        and on which other agencies usually have a voice, but not inevitably. No
                        such operations have been authorized. Nor has such an operation been
                        proposed. I am being candid—this is not information we generally tell other
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>I cannot absolutely exclude, again speaking totally frankly, that some office
                        does something unauthorized sometimes. It's extremely improbably and after a
                        period of months we would certainly find out. It's possible it could happen,
                        but not on a large scale.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Pentagon has also
                        an intelligence organization, but it also doesn't have authority to do these
                        things. Again I would like to propose the following to the Prime Minister.
                        If you have any information of any American engaging in those activities and
                        you give me his name, I can promise you in the name of the President he will
                        be removed. It's impossible for him to do it without being discovered by you
                        and us. We are talking about unauthorized actions now.</p>

                        raise—it's a little complicated question, because it's a matter of your
                        internal affairs but also an international problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can raise it, and

                        the world. That is one question that people throughout the world are most
                        unhappy about, and that's why they are not welcome. Because after the Second
                        World War, the U.S. is taking a hand in all kinds of affairs throughout the
                        world and this organization had a role to play.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. Because they have a role
                        and have a payroll, they must feed their stomachs. So as your President
                        said, and also as Your Excellency said, after the Second World War you
                        appeared to be very powerful both militarily and in the matter of economic
                        aid. So the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> thought they had the right
                        to look into everything. The result of this is causing disharmony in the
                        world. Now it is less than the espionage activities of the Soviet Union. We
                        are freely exchanging views.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is possible that activities
                        in the China mainland are comparatively less but not perhaps
                        nonexistent.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not sure it's in
                        our interest to reassure you completely, but I will. First, you said, what
                        will <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents do if they don't make
                        revolution somewhere? Most write long, incomprehensible reports and don't

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Those reports you referred to
                        are intelligence. While you use the word revolution, we say subversion.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or subversion. I
                        understand. We are conscious of what is at stake in our relationship, and we
                        will not let one organization carry out petty operations that could hinder
                        this course, what you described yesterday evening in your toast. You must
                        have noticed that since my visit in July a whole list of things which used
                        to be routine, especially in the military, have been changed.</p>
                    <p>But we will review all those activities once again, and I want to repeat that
                        we will not consider it an intervention in our affairs if you will point out
                        those measures that affect you directly, either in respect to the Taiwan
                        Independence Movement or other, and call them to our attention. It's not our
                        policy to subvert the government of the People's Republic of China or its
                        policy.</p>

                        initially. When we discuss the question of Japan, I will raise it again.
                        This is a matter which Taiwan also has complained of. <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and his son are very much
                        worried about this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Both the People's
                        Republic and the Taiwan authorities have the same view on this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. For instance, we
                        have set up the People's Republic for 22 years. We will not have some of our
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> people go to the U.S. to indulge in
                        activities. Even if a delegation went to the U.S., we would be very careful
                        that there is no misunderstanding because what we are seeking is friendship
                        between the two peoples. Because to change the system of any particular
                        country, that is the responsibility of that particular country and cannot be
                        done by any foreign countries, and we persist in this.</p>

                    <p>For instance, we are spending such a great effort to help in Vietnam, but we
                        never entered into Vietnamese affairs. Also in Cambodia. The Government of
                        Cambodia is in Peking, but some members are in Cambodia itself. There are
                        often internal disputes within their government, and sometimes when they ask
                        for our mediation, we say we will not stick our hands into it. But the
                        amount of articles we carry in our press concerning publications and reports
                        regarding the Royal Union of the government of Cambodia is unprecedented in
                        our press and world history. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Norodom
                            Sihanouk</persName> has already published 21 proclamations to his
                        people, and we have published them in our press and we have published them
                        in full without changing a word. If you say there's no freedom in our
                        country, that is the greatest freedom. We respect them and do not disrespect
                        their sovereignty because the head of state is in our country.</p>
                    <p>You may have some experts study this and see if any government dares to do
                        this. How did the British behave towards DeGaulle during the Second World
                        War? The former American Government gave support to the Kerensky government
                        in exile and also supported the government in exile of the three Baltic
                        states. At the same time you are now supporting the so-called government in
                        Taiwan, but you have never given them such privileges in your press. You can
                        refute me in one way. Your press is owned privately while ours is not.
                        That's the question because there's a question of profit. But we devote a
                        great amount of space to their publications.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless there are some people who say <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> is not free in China and is a prisoner and even
                        worse. I really can find no example of a head of state invited abroad who
                        has such extensive freedom. Sihanouk wants to visit Europe, and we now have
                        a possibility of sending him with our special plane because we have now an
                        exit via the countries in central Asia; as you went last time, Pakistan and
                        Tehran.</p>

                        Only Greece we have not established relations with. One thing we cannot do.
                        After our special plane sends <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> to Europe, we cannot guarantee his safety.
                        Saboteurs may come. They may come from the side of the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SM4">Matak</persName> clique. If it does come from that clique then it will
                        involve you. That is a very <pb n="18" xml:id="d40-18" facs="d40-18"/>natural logic followed in the world. So we are always considering how to
                        guarantee his safety. We can guarantee his safety in China itself. But if he
                        is to go abroad we can guarantee his security on our plane.</p>

                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Where I said. Romania,
                        Yugoslavia, Algeria, and probably the United Arab Republic of Egypt. Because
                        activities of saboteurs can be carried out easily. It can happen within the
                        U.S. They may even put a plastic bomb outside the plane to destroy the
                        plane. When I went to the Bandung Conference in 1955 I almost lost my
                        life.</p>
                    <p>At that time we chartered an Indian plane, the “Kashmir Princess” from Hong
                        Kong. Because Prime Minister U Nu wanted me to go with him, I went to Burma.
                        He asked <persName corresp="#p_NJ3">Nehru</persName> and Nasser to go with
                        him and I changed my route at the last minute while the others went via Hong
                        Kong. The saboteurs thought I was on the “Kashmir Princess” and set a time
                        bomb on the plane. Just as the “Kashmir Princess” was about to reach
                        Bandung, it exploded in mid-air and crashed into the sea.</p>
                    <p>India, together with authorities in Hong Kong, investigated the bombing. We
                        have evidence that the bomb was placed by a Chinese who was brought over to
                        Hong Kong, and I convinced the Indian Commissioner to go directly with our
                        people to Hong Kong and demand from the Hong Kong authorities that they
                        arrest that man. But such news leaks out, and the Indian told his Embassy,
                        and just as we got to Hong Kong that man flew to Taiwan. So such things are
                        sometimes not the responsibility of that government, and some individuals
                        may do it on their own.</p>
                    <p>As for international hijacking, we do not approve those activities. It's too
                        unreasonable. Such adventurous acts are not a good practice, regardless of
                        the motives behind it, whether it is revolutionary or of a saboteur nature.
                        I say these not as superfluous words but to explain how people of the world
                        think of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. As for we ourselves, we
                        are not very much excited by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Maybe
                        indirectly. I didn't know Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was the chairman of the committee.</p>

                        things. Day-to-day things I don't know. I am only told of something that can
                        have major foreign policy consequences. Not the sort of thing the Prime
                        Minister described. I would not even hear about that.</p>

                        are often some organizations that even though you are their chairman the
                        more they seal you off. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        has a thesis: those who hail you are not the ones who support you. He said
                        it to Edgar Snow. There are three types of such persons. Those who support
                        you and hail long life; they really support you; others support you maybe a
                        little; and third, those who are double dealers and applaud you but under
                        the table their feet kick you. Such people probably exist no matter the
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I see many of
                        those.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This will exist probably 10,000
                        years hence and even one million years hence, so long as human society
                        exists. When humanity on earth disappears there may be people on other
                        stars. This is a common phenomenon of society. One must be cool-headed and
                        analyze things. And so you said that after the July 15 announcement, the
                        majority supported it, and a minority were against it. I believe that. It's
                        also true in China. There's no such thing as unanimous approval of
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Only for those not

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For friendship we must
                        be frank and know how each feels. I appreciate how the Prime Minister feels
                        and he can be certain it will be taken absolutely seriously. We will not let
                        officials subvert the trend we have started.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We must be prepared in our
                        minds. There will be some who will want to subvert it. Only when we have
                        such a preparation can we do our things well.</p>
                    <p>I think your colleagues have never heard someone on the other side saying
                        such things. So its only the second meeting, and I am saying what I want to
                        you. You and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> are familiar
                        with this but not Miss Matthews and our new friend [referring to Jon Howe].
                        You probably thought the <pb n="20" xml:id="d40-20" facs="d40-20"/>Chinese
                        Communist Party has three heads and six arms. But, lo and behold, I am like
                        you. Someone you can talk reason with and talk honestly. Back to Taiwan. I
                        thought it was beneficial to say something about the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> just then.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's very important
                        because in the relationship of our two countries much depends on confidence.
                        There will be many ambiguous events and it is important to understand what
                        we are really thinking.</p>
                    <p>A few more words about Taiwan. As I also said last time, we will not support,
                        and indeed we will oppose, the establishment of Japanese military forces on
                        Taiwan, military influence on Taiwan, and to the extent we have influence in
                        Japan we will oppose an attempt by Japan to support the Taiwan Independence
                        Movement.</p>
                    <p>We will support any peaceful resolution of the issues in the Taiwan Straits,
                        and we will not be an obstacle to it.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to move towards a normalization of relations with the
                        People's Republic of China, and we understand what you have in mind.</p>
                    <p>All of this the President will reaffirm in restricted meetings to you, Mr.
                        Prime Minister, and to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I would like to add a few other observations if I may. With the same
                        frankness with which the Prime Minister has spoken to me, I have to tell him
                        that for us this is, of course, a somewhat painful process. We have worked
                        with the Government of Taiwan for many years and whatever the course of the
                        history that produced this, it is not easy for us to make the changes which
                        we have outlined to you. Also there are many elements in the U.S. who are
                        violently opposed to the policy we are pursuing and who will be even more
                        opposed to it as it begins to unwind.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the People's Republic considers the subject of Taiwan an
                        internal issue, and we will not challenge that. But to the degree that the
                        People's Republic can on its own, in the exercise of its own sovereignty,
                        declare its willingness to settle it by peaceful means, our actions will be
                        easier. I am not speaking of undertaking to talk towards us as we asked in
                        1955, but something you do on your own. But whether you do or not, we will
                        continue in the direction which I indicated.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d40-21" facs="d40-21"/>
                    <p>Secondly, I want to say a few words about the discussion in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There are many elements in our bureaucracy
                        who are, of course, pursuing the traditional policies. And since we have not
                        told them all the details of the discussions in July, it has not been
                        possible to instill the discipline that will be the case as the years go on.
                        We have carried out what I told the Prime Minister we would do when I was
                        here in July. And we have tried to keep our rhetoric also at a lower level.
                        I think the Prime Minister will have noticed that the President has not made
                        a public statement on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Actually, if I can speak candidly to the Prime Minister, and this is not a
                        matter in his control, it would be best for the policies which we discussed
                        if the Albanian Resolution did not pass this year. In the latest public
                        opinion poll, there are still 62% of the American people who are opposed to
                        the expulsion of Taiwan from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. And if
                        the transition—the work of the July 15 announcement was very severe, and if
                        there's another shock now, the elements opposed to what we are doing will
                        have a rallying point, and they will launch a sharp attack prematurely. I am
                        talking very candidly to you, Mr. Prime Minister. So paradoxically, if the
                        position that has been advanced in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        should prevail for this year, it will make it easier to carry out the
                        policies we described, and it will make it easier next year to moderate our
                        policies in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>But I want to assure the Prime Minister that we are not looking for a clever
                        way out of what I told him in July. With respect to Taiwan, I think we
                        understand that it's possible to do more than we can say. And that some
                        things can be left to an historical evolution as long as we both understand
                        the way it's going. And that, of course, everything is easier for us if the
                        resolution is peaceful. I am sure the President will reaffirm everything
                        that I have said.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The question of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> I will discuss at some point later. Our
                        central question of concern is Taiwan. The question of Taiwan is a question
                        that was already solved after the Second World War, but then became a
                        question outstanding. Because after the Second World War it was a matter of
                        certainty that in the instruments of surrender and in the signing in 1945
                        Japan gave up all claims on Taiwan just as it gave up all claims to
                        Manchuria. <pb n="22" xml:id="d40-22" facs="d40-22"/>The difference with
                        Manchuria is that Soviet troops had already entered into Manchuria, and
                        Chinese troops followed immediately after. So there was no question of
                        China's restoring sovereignty over Manchuria. Although at the beginning the
                        majority of it was occupied by <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>'s troops, then the whole of Manchuria was lost and
                        became no international problem. The so-called State of Manchukuo existed
                        for 14 years under the military occupation of the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>The difference about Taiwan is that because of China's defeat in 1894, China
                        was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan. That is similar to Sakhalin Island that
                        was conceded to Japan after the war of 1905. And it was also like the
                        question after the Prussian War of 1870 when Alsace-Lorraine was conceded to
                        Germany. The First World War was concluded in 1918, and the Germans lost,
                        and Alsace-Lorraine was restored to France, and no questions asked. But
                        during the Second World War Nazi Germany occupied even greater areas of
                        France. After the Allies won victory, all of France was restored.</p>
                    <p>So when one says that Taiwan was under Japan for a long period of time, it
                        was only fifty years and if you compare to Alsace-Lorraine, it was two years
                        less. It's clear. I have never been to Taiwan, but I have been to Salzburg
                        in Alsace-Lorraine and it was clear that the inhabitants there spoke German.
                        You noticed. So the vast majority of people on Taiwan spoke Fukien dialect.
                        Some learned Japanese.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Japanese claim is
                        no problem for us.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But there does exist this
                        adverse current in the world, and they say the status remains undetermined.
                        That's entirely absurd.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's not been said by
                        any American spokesman since June.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That was trouble provoked by
                        your State Department, and then you forbade them to say more. Britain now
                        wants to raise the level of representation to Ambassador. I can tell you
                        something here, but please don't make it public.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Nothing here will be
                        made public and not outside the President. This goes only to the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I believe that. And I have even
                        more confidence in the young. Old politicians sometimes have too many
                        connections. The British Government says that the government of the United
                        Kingdom acknowledges <pb n="23" xml:id="d40-23" facs="d40-23"/>the position
                        of the government of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan is a
                        province of the People's Republic of China. That is clear and acknowledging
                        the law. Not recognize but acknowledge. So for lawyers there might be a
                        slight differentiation between acknowledge and recognize. That is a question
                        of International Law.</p>
                    <p>What is more the British Government says as soon as it has declared this, the
                        British Consulate in Taiwan will be withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>Third, the British Government said they will openly declare this and vote for
                        the Albanian resolution. You know this. When your Deputy Secretary of State
                        was visiting Europe, the British made its attitude very clear. So logically
                        that should be sufficient.</p>
                    <p>Then there was a reservation that this was not to be made public. That is
                        British diplomacy, that is the way the British Government said they
                        themselves would not promote the theory that the status of Taiwan remains
                        undetermined, but would not try to persuade any government. But when asked
                        its position, the British Government says its position remains unchanged. So
                        that is very interesting.</p>
                    <p>[At this point there is a short break.]</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Sorry, I didn't think of
                        everyone taking break.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We followed your
                        lead.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So it's clear that if we are
                        to proceed from expediency we can agree with this formula of the British
                        Government, that they will not say unless asked. More people can support
                        this, but we do not consider this acceptable. On this matter one should
                        proceed with an earnest attitude on international problems.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What will you not
                        accept?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That final reservation, which
                        the British Government said, that its policy will not change. There will be
                        a consequence to that. That state of affairs of being asked whether its
                        position has changed may not occur. From the standpoint of the British
                        Government it should not reserve that attitude, because the British
                        Government is a signatory to the Cairo Declaration. At that time
                        participating were the heads of government of the U.S., Britain, and China.
                        Also the British were signatories to the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="d40-24" facs="d40-24"/>
                    <p>What about the historical facts? Afterwards the British Government sent
                        someone to take over Taiwan and had a provincial governor established. At
                        that time no difference of view was expressed by the allies. So after the
                        Chinese people had overthrown the rule of the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique, President Truman declared that
                        Taiwan had returned to the Chinese people, and the U.S. had no interest in
                        territory there. There are documents stressing that. The decision of
                        President Truman at that time was of no concern to the existence or not of
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Just because of the Korean War he suddenly decided to send in the Seventh
                        Fleet to Taiwan and advisors, and from that time he declared the Taiwan and
                        Taiwan Straits under American protection. He mentioned nuclear devices, that
                        there were devices there.</p>
                    <p>And so later on in the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan he uses a very
                        strange formulation to declare this. In it it was said that Japan renounces
                        all claim to such and such territories, that is to say, Japan renounces
                        claim to all such territories with the exception of the four principal
                        islands of Japan—Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoka, and Kyushu and that with the
                        exception of these four principal islands, Japan would not claim any others.
                        Japan renounces claim to the southern side of Sakhelin and the Kuriles and
                        to the position of the Ryukyus, including Okinawa, remained open and also
                        Taiwan and the Spratley islands. But it was not specified in the San
                        Francisco Treaty to whom they belong. It was left to the countries. I don't
                        know who drew that up.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Dulles, the Prime
                        Minister's old acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So afterwards individual
                        treaties were made with Japan. At that time <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> was only a small dynasty hanging on to
                        Taiwan, with American protection, so what could he say? He could only act as
                        he was told to do. He himself sits on Taiwan, but in the treaty with Japan
                        it does not specify who Taiwan reverts to, only saying Japan gives up all
                        claim. If I call him as a traitor, I have every reason to do that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He claims, too, that
                        there's only one China but that is the Island of Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>

                        Treaty of Japan. I tell the way that it is in the Peace Treaty with
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="d40-25" facs="d40-25"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When you made your agreement
                        with Japan to revert Okinawa and the Ryukyus to the Japanese, <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> asked why you were not
                        returning them to China.</p>
                    <p>Taiwan is cursing us about the Ryukyus; not just about Okinawa. Because in
                        history during the Ming and Ching dynasties the rulers of those islands and
                        maybe even earlier… I will not go into the historical facts of that, but I
                        am certain those islands sent gifts to the Chinese Emperor and were looked
                        upon as tributary states. Maybe they were sent envoys to show concern for
                        them. It merely shows relations between states. But in the factual empire
                        days it was looked on as tributary states. Such things occurred in the
                        Ottoman and Roman and Inca Empires in ancient days. All states that had
                        relations with them were looked upon as belonging to them. If that's to be
                        considered, then the world will be overturned and the world turned into
                        chaos. The ownership of Taiwan and the Pescadores are not stated in the
                        so-called Peace Treaty with Japan, and so it's null and void.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Chiang</persName> did not settle this problem. Later in order to
                        seek protection from Dulles, he no longer mentioned that in his treaty.
                        Particularly after the conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> treaty and Dulles went to Taiwan and <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, he didn't dare to raise
                        this question.</p>
                    <p>It's a ludicrous state of affairs because the situation in Taiwan remained
                        undetermined and the government itself is undetermined. He claims to
                        represent the whole of China, but he was overthrown by the Chinese people.
                        The place he is sitting in now, the status of that island, remains
                        undetermined. From this point of view it can be said his government is
                        hanging in mid-air.</p>
                    <p>This is a question that must be made clear. We ask the British Government why
                        they insist on that reservation, and the British Government said that during
                        the Conservative Government it was stated in Parliament. But that is not the
                        only reason because a party is capable of changing its policy. For the new
                        to replace the old it is a natural phenomenon. Why is it then that the
                        British Government insists on maintaining what it said 20 years ago? That is
                        because in their minds they think there will certainly be a day when the
                        movement for so-called Taiwan independence will rise <pb n="26" xml:id="d40-26" facs="d40-26"/>up in accordance with the theory that the
                        status remains undetermined. Of course, first of all Japan advocates that
                        point of view and secondly, they have in mind the United States.</p>
                    <p>So what I would like to clarify with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> today is that is it the stated policy of the
                        United States Government that it still wants to maintain the point of view
                        that the status of Taiwan remains undetermined or is it the U.S. Government
                        policy that Taiwan is already returned to China and is a province of China?
                        As to how the Chinese people will solve the question of the Taiwan regime,
                        that is of secondary importance. I have told you that last time. I replied
                        to you already that we will try to bring about a peaceful settlement, the
                        last morning before you left.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I remember.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So what is your point of view on
                        the theory of the undetermined status of Taiwan? (Pauses) Maybe it's
                        difficult for you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I have discovered this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to formulate my
                        answer with some precision and I don't have the same clarity of mind as the
                        Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Let me separate what we can say and what our policy is. We do not challenge
                        the fact that all Chinese maintain that there's only one China and that
                        Taiwan is part of that China. And therefore we do not maintain that the
                        status in that respect is undetermined. How this can be expressed is a
                        difficult matter, but we would certainly be prepared in a communique that
                        might be issued to take note of the fact that all Chinese maintain that
                        there is only one China. So that is the policy of this government.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is the first point. Any
                        second point?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is the point of
                        our policy. The second point is what can be said, and I think I have
                        answered that also. I can also assure the Prime Minister that the phrase
                        “undetermined” will not be repeated.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If in the international arena
                        certain countries, for instance Japan, or some other countries, were to
                        raise this either in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or some other
                        public forum in the world, what would your attitude be when they say the
                        status is “undetermined?”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me tell the Prime
                        Minister that I have not discussed this particular question in detail with
                        the President. So I can only give my impression. If I am wrong, I will give
                        him the answer through our channel. I will never deliberately mislead him.
                            (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>Let me say two things. First we are not encouraging any government to
                        maintain the position that the status is undetermined. The British
                        Government's position is an independent position and not at our
                        encouragement.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, if a government raises this issue without our encouragement, we
                        would certainly not support it. And I think the Prime Minister will have
                        noticed that in our UN statements, no matter how distasteful they may have
                        been to him, we took great care, and if the bureaucracy had been more
                        pliable greater care, but we took great care not to mention the independent
                        state of Taiwan. I think I can say to him with some confidence that we will
                        do nothing that will encourage the elaboration of a two-China or one-China,
                        one-Taiwan policy, in whatever form it's presented. Our attempt will be to
                        bring about a solution within a framework of one China and by peaceful
                        means.</p>
                    <p>I will check this with the President and confirm it through our channel. The
                        last sentence I can confirm now, i.e. I can confirm our policy of one China
                        by peaceful means. But not the sentence on what tactical position we will
                        take if another government raises whether the status of Taiwan is
                        undetermined. I can confirm our position to bring about peaceful solution
                        within the framework of one China. To “bring about” may be too active; “to
                        encourage” is more correct. It's for the Chinese themselves to settle. It's
                        not something we should actively push. We should try within the framework of
                        one China. What tack we will take if another government raises the status as
                        undetermined, I believe it will be that we will not support it, but I will
                        check it with the President when I return.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Another question which is
                        related to this question, that is when Taiwan, under the rule of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique, is
                        returned to the <pb n="28" xml:id="d40-28" facs="d40-28"/>motherland—of
                        course Taiwan was returned to the motherland, but because of the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> rule there is a problem—but
                        should it be returned, then the U.S. treaty, which we have never recognized,
                        will it be possible to have it null and void at that time?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When Taiwan and China
                        become one again by peaceful means then the treaty would lapse. It is not a
                        permanent feature of our foreign policy to be maintained under such
                        circumstances.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: From our side our position is
                        that although we have all along considered that treaty to be null and void
                        and do not recognize it, but still our requirement at the time of your
                        withdrawal of all military from Taiwan and as you remove all military
                        installations from there, would be to declare the treaty null and void.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand your
                        position and we hope that by that time the evolution will have reached a
                        point where formal action may be unnecessary.</p>

                        establishment of diplomatic relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand the Prime
                        Minister's point of view.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is the present situation of
                        Taiwan no longer exists, and all U.S. armed forces and military
                        installations have been withdrawn from Taiwan, and the Taiwan Straits area.
                        And the treaty which was to protect the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> clique will become abrogated. You say “lapsed.” When
                        that time comes there will be no longer difficulties between China and the
                        United States, and only then it is possible for diplomatic relations between
                        China and the United States.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise it's not possible for us to go to Washington, to have two Chinese
                        Ambassadors there. Your President and you may come here because there is
                        only one United States here as far as we are concerned. But I cannot go to
                        the United States because there's the so-called ambassador of Chiang
                        Kai-shek there. The differences are clear. You would not allow the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> ping pong team to perform in
                        front of the White House but it did perform there [Washington] and so while
                        it is there our ping pong team could not go. There is this difference.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But from our point of view what
                        is even more urgent than the Taiwan question is your withdrawal from
                        Indochina. We can discuss this this afternoon. I discussed other thing. For
                        you too it's a most urgent matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Before we come to that
                        I would like to answer one question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That will be this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                        asked what our position would be once Taiwan has come back to the
                        motherland. When Taiwan and China become one, we can abrogate that treaty.
                        That's not a problem. Once there is formal unification, there's no reason
                        for us to have a treaty with a province of China. We will present no
                        obstacle in the way of such a political evolution. If the event that the
                        Prime Minister mentioned in my last meeting should come about, either
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> or his son should
                        return to the mainland, we will not discourage it. To be very frank with the
                        Prime Minister what we would like most and what we would encourage is a
                        peaceful negotiation after which all the military relationships would be at
                        an end.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Assistance or relationships?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After there is a
                        political settlement between Taiwan and mainland China, yes. We will not
                        insist on maintaining an American presence or military installations on
                        Taiwan after unification of China by peaceful negotiations has been
                        achieved. And in those conditions we will be prepared to abrogate formally.
                        If there's no peaceful settlement, which is the second contingency, then
                        it's easier for us to withdraw our military presence in stages, which I
                        indicated to the Prime Minister than to abrogate the treaty.</p>

                        would go in.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would not stand for
                        that.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have a common
                        interest there.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is right. What they want to
                        do is replace you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, we
                        have no interest in the military expansion of Japan.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right because they have
                        threatened in the past not only China but all countries in the Pacific. We

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be a very
                        shortsighted policy.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We think the <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> speech in that connection is not very
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It has been denied that
                        he made it, but never repeated.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Some friends have asked
                        what I would do after I left this job, and I said I would run a school for
                        unruly boys.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's not an easy thing to run
                        such a school. I would not like such a job. Some people don't listen to you
                        even if they are claiming to be of the same party or claim to listen to you.
                        While there's humanity in the world there will be such people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me be more honest
                        with you than I have been with any other foreign leader. I have to select
                        those issues on which to enforce discipline. I am —</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Therefore, we choose to
                        enforce discipline only on those statements that have practical
                        consequences. We cannot keep <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                        from making statements. But we can keep him from drawing practical

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Our only formal commentary was
                        that on August 20.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Some of your less
                        formal are more vehement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No matter, you know that is
                        “firing empty guns.” When we say “down with imperialism” it's for the people
                        of the countries concerned. The same when we say “down with revisionism.” If
                        the people of the Soviet Union don't rise up to overthrow their leaders,
                        it's empty cannon. We fire one empty cannon at them and they fire back 100
                        at us. We would not say they are doing it a 100 times. It's not worth
                        it.</p>
                    <p>So we must differentiate our comment. When it's actual policy we must be very
                        prudent because in those matters what we say must count; it must be based on
                        principle not just empty cannons. You cannot fire cannon at random, but if
                        you were to then we would be happy no one would believe in those words. You
                        understand this better than the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>What I ask now is that you affirm that you don't want Japanese armed forces
                        to go into Taiwan and this must be affirmed only while your armed forces are
                        in Taiwan. Isn't that so? You had already admitted in the time of President
                        Truman that Taiwan was Chinese territory and you noted her ambitions toward
                        it, and it was also President Truman who sent troops to Taiwan. The
                        Republican Party is not responsible for that but since you are already there
                        you must be responsible for the situation. Because after you went into
                        Taiwan and with the conclusion of the treaty of 1954, this matter became not
                        only a matter of internal Chinese affairs but of international affairs. We
                        do not advocate using armed forces against you. These discussions began
                        first in August 1955. Only now can we say that we are earnestly going into
                        negotiations. When we say of the Japanese going into Taiwan, it includes the
                        military aspects as well as the economic and political aspects. This is
                        something not only we but <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> is following closely too. Just some time ago the
                        elder brother of <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, went to Taiwan where he was to attend
                        the meeting of The Cooperating Committee of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.
                        Three pro-Japanese chieftains on Taiwan took part in this meeting.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Main people. On the civil side
                        is Chang Ch'un, the Secretary General of the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique; on the military side is
                            <persName>Huang</persName> Chieh, the Minister of Defense of the Chiang
                        forces. He still has influence on <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>'s troops. <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> is very ill at ease about him. He was my captain at
                        the Whampoa Academy when <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> was head and he was military commissioner and was
                        director of teaching. In his middle age he was quite able to fight.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is quite fearful
                        of him. But is in quite good health and not dying so <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is worried about him. The
                        third man called Ku Cheng-kang is a subordinate of Hui Ting, a member of the
                        Central Committee and also the President of the Japanese-Chinese Friendship
                        Association.</p>
                    <p>After you left in the latter part of July, both Chang Ch'un and Ku Cheng-kang
                        visited Japan. At this time Japan made some suggestions to them, that is to
                        find a formula to solve the problem of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But the formula cannot be agreed to by <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, that is to say that those
                        three pro-Japanese elements would be willing to turn Taiwan into a
                        subsidiary state of Japan. Towards the latter part of the war of aggression,
                        shortly before the Pacific war, there was a time when President Roosevelt
                        was paying attention to what to do with Southeast Asia, and those three men
                        I mentioned all wavered. If you meet Mr. Service, he will tell you about
                        these three men, and he will tell you the same thing. When I met some days
                        ago more than 60 American friends, I did not mention these men but I saw
                        that Mr. Service knew what I meant, this plot was being hatched by them.
                        There were some young American friends who did not know about this.</p>
                    <p>So if such a state of affairs cropped up what would be your attitude?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                        always produces dialectic answers in me because I am in the People's
                        Republic of China. Maybe he is engaging in subtle teaching. The relatively
                        easy part is the projection of a Japanese military presence to Taiwan. It's
                        out of the question while there <pb n="33" xml:id="d40-33" facs="d40-33"/>are American forces there. And if it happened while there are American
                        forces there, it will require us to reconsider the American presence, In
                        other words, we would oppose it. If it happens at a later stage —</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So long as <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is still around he will not
                        permit Japanese military forces to go in, but as you know, <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is already 85.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If it happened
                        afterwards the problem would be more difficult, but in any event the U.S.
                        would oppose Japanese forces on Taiwan. This I can say categorically.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, this would not conform to
                        the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would not conform to
                        the San Francisco Treaty and would raise a whole new spectre in the Pacific,
                        but it would cause us to reconsider our whole policy in the Pacific if Japan
                        started sending forces outside its territory.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the problem of political and economic expansion of Japan, I have to
                        be honest with the Prime Minister, is a more difficult problem because it's
                        harder to measure. I can only say that it's not American policy to let
                        Taiwan become a subsidiary state of Japan. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It would be most disadvantageous
                        to the attempts to relax tension in the Far East. In fact, it's
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand that. But
                        it's important we know that even before diplomatic relations we have a means
                        of exchanging views and some visible signs of Sino-American relations, and
                        we think that will affect the situation in Taiwan and also we believe in
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Even now it's affecting to a
                        certain degree Japan, for instance, the biggest Japanese steel manufacturer.
                        It produces 30 million tons of steel in its own structure alone. Your
                        President had said that in a year or two Japan may catch up with the U.S. in
                        steel production. That is the biggest Japanese steel company. That steel
                        company originally took part in the commission of Taiwan, Japan and South
                        Korea. Now it openly declared that it will not go to Taiwan and on the
                        contrary, accepted our proposition, that is to say, it declared it would
                        give up its deal to have Taiwan as a colony.</p>
                    <pb n="34" xml:id="d40-34" facs="d40-34"/>
                    <p>So we can see changes are taking place. There are the conditions to make
                        common efforts to prevent the reemergence of Japanese militarism. Those of
                        you who are experienced about Japan since the 30's after the Mukden
                        incident. At that time Britain was allied to Japan. So Britain came to
                        understand Japan later.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not discussing
                        Japan now, but I will make one comment. I think if we treat each other with
                        confidence there are certain things we can do together, but there is a
                        danger that if the Chinese side acts too impetuously with respect to Japan
                        this will bring about a forging of ties with Japan within the U.S. and U.S.
                        and Japan. One attack on us is that we have sacrificed Japan for China. So
                        some restraint on the Chinese side is necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We are most restrained with
                        regard to Japan because even now a state of war has not past between China
                        and Japan in 26 years. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> expressed
                        a desire to see China even before President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, but we pay no attention.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This could have the
                        possibility of influencing the successor to Sato.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is possible. Let's not go
                        too far off the topic. Who do you think will succeed him?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Japanese are very
                        unpredictable. I think Fukuda.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He was reared by <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> himself.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As I told the Prime
                        Minister yesterday, not all Japanese leaders who want good relations with
                        China are easy to get along with. I always thought that Nakasone was the
                        most nationalistic.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He was your student, you must
                        know about him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have known him since
                        1952.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In 1955 he came in the capacity
                        as peace delegate to the conference. Years later he became the Director
                        General of National Defense Ministry. After visiting the U.S. and talking
                        with <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>, he put out his Fourth
                        Defense Plan. We have quite a long experience with Japan.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="d40-35" facs="d40-35"/>
                    <p>We have said so much about Taiwan. When we conclude our discussion we can
                        formalize that. The most difficult topic is how we will put it down in the
                        communique.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right. It will
                        require restraint and wisdom. I have more of the latter than the former.</p>

                        will go back now for lunch. We will meet at 4:00 or 4:30.</p>

                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: October 21, 1971, 4:42 - 7:17 p.m.</p>
                    <p>GENERAL SUBJECT: <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Indochina</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wonder whether before
                        we start this subject I could make two points to the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One is, again, a minor
                        technical point. It would be best, and I think the Prime Minister agrees, if
                        the technical people met as a group. This way Commander Howe can keep an eye
                        on them, whereas if they break up into separate groups I can't be
                        responsible for them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We don't think it's good to
                        break into several groups.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And if the Prime
                        Minister would permit me to make another comment picking up a point we made
                        this morning. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>This morning the Prime Minister said certain words are “empty guns” and we
                        shouldn't take them so seriously, and in general I agree with him. But I
                        thought it might interest the Prime Minister if I showed <pb n="2" xml:id="d41-02" facs="d41-02"/>him a report which I received from my
                        office on how the American press played the arrival here, and which points
                        they stressed. A lot of this material doesn't concern China at all, but I
                        didn't want the Prime Minister to think that I am being secretive so I am
                        giving him the whole cable. And I think the Prime Minister will see that in
                        both the written press and on television, instead of emphasizing the purpose
                        for which I came here, people stress certain signs that the press noticed
                        that were put up at the airport. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        laughs)</p>
                    <p>Here is the whole document; you can read it yourself. I have underlined the
                        points. It's … the only reason I mention it is because, in my case it is not
                        a matter of great importance, except I am convinced at this moment the
                        Ambassadors from Taiwan, the Soviet Union and Japan are very active in
                        spreading this all over Washington.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's certain.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And if this were to
                        happen in the case of the President, then it would, of course, have a very
                        bad effect on public opinion. But I say this in the spirit of our discussion
                        this morning, and not as any criticism. Of course, I have sent a telegram to
                        point out that despite all the press has reported, our reception could not
                        have been more cordial nor the discussions more constructive. I have just
                        sent this back.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Your comments were correct.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is my profound
                        conviction. I did this so that people would not misunderstand the
                        report.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Right, I was fully prepared in
                        spirit for all of this, for them doing so because our slogan has been up
                        there for quite a long time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I won't discuss it,
                        because I considered the Prime Minister's toast our greeting and nothing
                        else.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Don't they think that we have
                        said enough? Our slogan includes application to imperialism, revisionism,
                        and all other reactionaries, so they must be feeling better.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d41-03" facs="d41-03"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They don't know what
                        revisionism means, Mr. Prime Minister. I hate to tell you that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's where the trouble comes
                        from, and that's where the tragedy arises. They say we are left
                        revisionists.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is true.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So, shall we continue. Some
                        small matters are bound to arise, but this does not obstruct the development
                        of the general situation. With respect to the question of Taiwan, there is
                        one more question I would like to clarify.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is with respect to the
                        proposal, the draft resolution put forward in the United Nations by the
                        United States and Japanese Governments advocating one China and two
                        governments. The proposal in this form, on the contrary, has made it even
                        more unacceptable when it is considered from the point of view of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter. Of course we oppose this
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>But about your putting this forward, some people say there is now a feeling
                        on your part of wanting to have it fail, and in view of your words this
                        morning, I don't think you would wish for your resolution completely to
                        fail. The spirit in which the personal representative of your President, Mr.
                        Reagan, acted in his visit to Taiwan and in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, I don't think was in the
                        same spirit. We don't think that resolution was of a very high standard. Of
                        course, I also understand it is difficult to put forward a resolution of
                        that kind.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: First of all Governor
                        Reagan is a specialized aspect of the American political scene. Now I will
                        speak frankly to you Mr. Prime Minister, because it makes no sense … you
                        will meet our diplomats soon enough. For us to carry out the policy toward
                        you which you and I discussed in July, it is important that we maintain as
                        long as possible the support of the sort of people whom Governor Reagan
                        represents. And up to now, he has publicly supported our initiative, and
                        this has been of great consequence in enabling us to restrain that China
                        lobby.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d41-04" facs="d41-04"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So is the China lobby more
                        concentrated in the western part of the United States than others?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is concentrated
                        primarily in southern California, and in some parts of the south, but more
                        in the western part and southern part, not in the eastern part.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Is it because some persons in
                        the western parts and southern parts of the United States are more
                        interested in Pacific affairs, have some investments in the Orient, or
                        because some missionaries when they withdrew from the Orient went to the
                        West and South?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think the missionary
                        element is of considerable importance, as with Representative Judd.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Judd?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. And I think also
                        Governor Reagan represents the conservative wing, and for the conservative
                        wing anti-communism has always been an ideological necessity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Was Senator Judd's family
                        missionaries?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, medical
                        missionaries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And he has the same surname that
                        I have.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh really? So Governor
                        Reagan's trip should be seen in terms of the American domestic policy. He
                        does not represent our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>If you reveal these statements, you will also have to give me some employment
                        in your foreign office.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: (laughs) There is no question of
                        revealing these things.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now secondly, Mr. Prime
                        Minister, it does indicate, however, as I said to you this morning, that
                        victory this year for the Albanian Resolution would not be in the best
                        interests of the policy you and I have been discussing.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's why I am asking you,
                        wouldn't it be very unfavorable to you if your draft resolution could not
                        win the sympathy of other countries?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In my view, for this
                        year it would be unfavorable for both of us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's easy for us. We can just
                        not go and leave <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                        there. And <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> especially went to
                        ask <persName>Chiang</persName> to stay in the United Nations, no matter
                        what the consequences.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, he cannot stay if
                        the Albanian Resolution succeeds.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This visit of Kishi to
                        the President is an annual event which is produced by the fact that they
                        played golf together when the President was out of office.</p>

                        certain it does not concern <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> but I will check.</p>
                    <p>One result of an unfavorable <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote this year
                        would be that it would give our opponents a symbol around which to rally.
                        But I am answering your question, Mr. Prime Minister. It is not a suggestion
                        we are making to you. I am explaining to you why we have taken the position
                        we have.</p>
                    <p>Now, with respect to the first question the Prime Minister put to me, whether
                        we put forward the resolution in order to be defeated. The original <pb n="6" xml:id="d41-06" facs="d41-06"/>proposal which our bureaucracy made
                        was in the direction of a two-China solution, which simply said that any
                        government that exercised jurisdiction over an area should be in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and it put Taiwan on the same level as the
                        two Germanies, and two Koreas, and so forth. After our conversation in July
                        we have changed this to its present, somewhat inelegant, formulation, which
                        is to say one China and in effect two governments for the time being. We
                        thought, in the spirit of our discussion, to maintain the principle of one
                        China might be more important to you than the subsidiary issue of
                        representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The same with us. On our side,
                        we will certainly not give up Taiwan, or accept a so-called undetermined
                        status for Taiwan in exchange for a seat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because since the beginning of
                        the debate in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> up to the present I have
                        felt such a shadow and I have been openly discussing this with some foreign
                        visitors. I have asked some Japanese friends: if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agreed for Japan to be a permanent member of the Security
                        Council, but would not allow you to reacquire full sovereignty over Okinawa,
                        and asked you to give up forever all sovereignty over the four small islands
                        north of Hokkaido, would Japan agree? They said they wouldn't, and those
                        whom I spoke to included representatives of the Japanese-opposition, of the
                        Democratic Liberal party, and those with no political affiliations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Under our present
                        formula, you are not required to give up sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean your draft resolution
                        or the Albanian Resolution?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Even under our
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's very easy to deal with the
                        U. S. draft resolution. We can just refuse to go. That's very simple. I can
                        go back and go to bed. The question is that in the other resolution it calls
                        for the restoration of all lawful rights of China in the United Nations,
                        including its seat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d41-07" facs="d41-07"/>
                    <p>In that resolution it is not possible to put in a clause concerning the
                        status of Taiwan, and if it is passed, the status of Taiwan is not yet
                        decided.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the Albanian
                        Resolution?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There is such a danger. Of
                        course, countries who support the Albanian Resolution haven't thought of
                        this side of the question. But under this condition another shadow has
                        appeared in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and that might meet us on
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which shadow?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The activities I told you about
                        conducted by Japan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh I see.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Why does Britain want to leave
                        such a tail behind? Few countries in the world operate this way. And
                        therefore in the draft communique we would like to prepare between our
                        countries for the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> the wording regarding Taiwan is most difficult, and we
                        will have to rely on your assistants. They are young and will be able to
                        find a good way.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will try to find
                        some formulation that … as I told you, it is harder for us to say everything
                        than to do some of the things described, but we will try to find a way to
                        indicate our understanding of your concern. Although it probably will not go
                        far enough for your ultimate desire.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And do you mean it's
                        diametrically opposed to our ultimate desire or in the same direction?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It will be in the same
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will wait to see your wording
                        and your wisdom.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will try various
                        formulations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We are also considering this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As for the U. S.
                        resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I think this is one of
                        the questions history will take care of.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d41-08" facs="d41-08"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's true, but the struggle
                        that we face here today is quite troublesome. Because the majority of the
                        countries in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> truly wish to restore the
                        lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations,
                        especially in view of the fact that it has been deprived this for twenty-six
                        years, and especially in view of the fact that since the announcement has
                        been made it has encouraged them greatly. Japan itself wavered for a long
                        time over this issue, and that is very natural.</p>
                    <p>But what we think is more important is the future of Taiwan. And this is the
                        most crucial issue between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And so the question is rather
                        complicated.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Since August 20, we haven't said
                        anything on the issue of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know. You have been
                        very restrained and we have greatly appreciated it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have to see how the debate
                        comes out.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have valued your
                        restraint.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because in view of the whole
                        situation in the world, since our two countries wish to improve our
                        relations, then every step we take should be beneficial to that direction,
                        but it shouldn't be detrimental to the interests of our two peoples.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. The only
                        question we have to discuss is not the direction but the rate of progress we
                        can make.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If the rate of progress is a bit
                        slower, that's an easy aspect of the matter to deal with. The trouble is if
                        anything else from another direction barges in that will be troublesome,
                        like the knife of Mishima. A horizontal knife like that, if it should come,
                        that would be troublesome.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d41-09" facs="d41-09"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We both face the
                        problem that many countries and groups in the world might have an interest
                        in destroying the fragile relationship we are trying to build. We are
                        determined to proceed in the direction which we have started.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There are not a few who wish to
                        break up this relationship. I am not speaking about those among the people.
                        I am speaking about those in power.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. We have two
                        dangers from which to guard, speaking from our side. One is the elements who
                        want to come in from the side, as the Prime Minister points out, and the
                        second is that if we try to go too fast we tear the fabric. So what we
                        should do is to establish the direction both in these talks and when the
                        President comes here, and then to be sure that every step we take is in this
                        direction, and that we take no steps that are detrimental.</p>
                    <p>So we can call that a stage in our discussions and we can mention it later on
                        in our conclusion if it is agreeable to the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Shall we go on to the next
                        question, the question of Indochina, which is an even more urgent question
                        than the Taiwan issue, because your troops are still in Indochina and
                        haven't left yet; and we said very long ago that we wish to settle matters
                        not through force but through peaceful negotiations. We said this 16 years
                        ago, and now in view of the fact that your President is coming to visit it
                        should be more so.</p>
                    <p>Now the United Nations is discussing this matter so there is no special
                        reason for us to be very hasty on this matter. On the contrary, what we are
                        worried about is that if our legitimate rights in the United Nations are
                        restored, while the status of Taiwan is left hanging in the air, we will
                        have to consider this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand this
                        point. It is new to me quite honestly. I had not thought of it this way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But now the relatively more
                        urgent issue is the issue of Indochina, because the war there has not yet
                        ended; your troops the re have not withdrawn totally and the date of final
                        withdrawal has not been <pb n="10" xml:id="d41-10" facs="d41-10"/>set even.
                        And this year and in the coming year it will be an issue which people
                        throughout the world, including people of the United States, will call for
                        even more urgently. Especially since you left here, since you went back, the
                        United States Government has not replied to the seven points put forward by
                        the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is not true. The
                        Prime Minister is not correctly informed.</p>

                        saying the seven-point proposal can be taken as a basis for discussion but
                        the United States, since the proposal was put forward, has refused to answer
                        it. Especially after you returned from China, the U. S. has refused to take
                        such a position, and this makes the people of the world more unhappy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will let you finish,

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Some people are saying that it
                        goes without saying the United States in coming to China is wishing to put
                        the Vietnamese people aside in this matter. The seven-point proposal put
                        forward by the Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the
                        —</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know what you
                        mean.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Was put forward on the first day
                        of July and the announcement was made on the 15th of July and after that the
                        United States Government has refused to give any answer to the proposal and
                        some people are saying it was due to pressure from the Chinese. Though the
                        Chinese Government would never undertake any such obligation, some people
                        are talking in this way. You told me beforehand you were going to change the
                        head of your delegation at Paris, and you said he could also be sent to
                        China. At that time I didn't connect it with the Paris talks. But after the
                        issues of the announcement, and after such rumors were spreading around in
                        the world, it was impossible for us to accept Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understood.</p>

                        sorry, but under that political atmosphere, it was impossible to accept
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand this, but
                        we hope after some interval you will be able to accept him because he is the
                        diplomat whom the White House trusts the most, who is most reliable and can
                        speak freely.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Why is it he couldn't succeed in
                        Paris? So it seems to us that if the United States Government and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doesn't take the initiative
                        to proclaim a date of final withdrawal from Indochina, it will be
                        detrimental to the President's visit to China. Of course, it would not have
                        any other effect—the visit will still take place, but it will be better if
                        this is solved. And I have told you before that as a matter of principle we
                        support the PRG's seven-point proposal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have never doubted
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The specific solution must be
                        worked out between your two sides, because that is a matter of other
                        sovereign countries, and we cannot intervene. Although we have given such
                        large amounts of assistance to Vietnam, we never intervene in their internal
                        affairs. The final decision lies with the Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>And therefore we find it difficult to understand why President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would not like to declare a date of
                        final withdrawal from Indochina at such a favorable time like this. Because
                        you told me last time that you really did wish to withdraw from Vietnam,
                        that you didn't want to continue to be bogged down in that quagmire. People
                        in the United States and the rest of the world have their eyes on this
                        issue. And this is a question even more important than the question of the
                        restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the
                        United Nations, and a question even more urgent than the normalization of
                        Sino-American relations.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me reply to you,
                        Mr. Prime Minister, with absolute frankness. For us, Vietnam is a very
                        anguishing problem. We have been there now for many years, and it has
                        provoked enormous suffering in the United States. It was not this
                        Administration that got us into the war, but we have a responsibility for
                        ending it.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, before President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> came to office he had promised he
                        would do so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In 1967 when I was a
                        private citizen, I started private negotiations with Hanoi on my own
                        initiative, which later became official negotiations. But I must say that
                        while your allies in Vietnam know how to fight, I am not sure that they know
                        how to negotiate. Also I do not believe they have correctly informed you
                        about what has gone on this year.</p>
                    <p>First of all, which is a point of your honor, namely, the implication that
                        you have in any contributed to enabling us not to answer the seven
                        points—this is of course totally untrue. When I met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> in Paris on July 26 I told him
                        we wanted to end the war in Hanoi, and not Peking, and when we went to
                        Peking it was to discuss Sino-U.S. relations and not the Vietnam
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me tell the Prime Minister what we have done this year, and he will
                        see that the accusation that we have not replied to the seven points is
                        totally wrong.</p>
                    <p>On May 31 I met Minister <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName>
                        secretly in Paris and proposed to him seven points for ending the war, seven
                        American points. One of these seven points was an offer to set a deadline
                        for our withdrawal. On June 26, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName> came to Paris, and I met with him secretly and he
                        proposed to me nine points in reply. On July 1, Madame Binh published her
                        seven points, and the Prime Minister will admit that it is an odd procedure
                        to be given nine points secretly and seven points publicly. As a diplomatic
                        historian, I don't know many examples of this procedure.</p>
                    <p>On July 12, on the way back from Peking, I met Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> secretly in Paris. I may tell
                        the Prime Minister, while it was difficult to get to Peking unobserved, it
                        was infinitely harder to meet Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName> secretly with 200 press people chasing me all over Paris.
                        I asked <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> which points we
                        should deal with, the nine points or the seven points. He told us that the
                        nine points were the more significant points, and that these were the ones
                        we should negotiate. Since the nine points were secret, it was obvious that
                        we could not make a public reply to the seven points, or there would have
                        been absolute confusion.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, on August 16, we made a formal eight-point proposal which
                        incorporated our reply to the nine points as well as our reply to the seven
                        points and which in fact accepted verbatim several of the seven points, word
                        for word. I might point out, Mr. Prime Minister, that while I came secretly
                        to Paris, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> could not
                        find it possible to come from Hanoi, and I had to deal with a
                        subordinate.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan
                            Thuy</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On September 13, I came again secretly to Paris; again Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> was not present. At this
                        meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName> rejected two of
                        the eight points we had made. We then reformulated our proposals, and we
                        have submitted eight new points on October 11. Of these eight points, six
                        are the same; we reformulated the two points to which Hanoi objected.</p>
                    <p>We have requested another secret meeting on November 1, and we have not yet
                        received a reply. Therefore, far from our refusing to reply to the seven
                        points, it is Hanoi who has refused to reply to us. Of our eight points,
                        four are drawn almost verbatim from the nine points of Hanoi and two are
                        drawn from the seven points of Madame Binh, verbatim.</p>
                    <p>Also, Mr. Prime Minister, you spoke very eloquently the last time we were
                        here about the necessity of not leaving any tail behind. This has been
                        reflected in our proposals of August 16, but especially in our proposal of
                        October 11.</p>
                    <p>I want to be candid with you, Mr. Prime Minister. If we made our proposals
                        public we could completely dominate public opinion on this question because
                        we have gone as far as anyone could possibly go, and there will be no one in
                        the United States of America who will ask us to go further than we have
                        gone. But we are not interested in winning a propaganda battle; we are
                        interested in ending the war. And we see no reason why Hanoi will settle
                        more easily if we engage in a public exchange with them if it doesn't in the
                        form of secret exchanges.</p>
                    <p>So the problem as we see it is this. We have offered to set a fixed date for
                        withdrawal. We have offered new elections six months after a peace is
                        signed. We have offered that all American troops withdraw one month before
                        the election. And we have offered that the President and Vice President of
                        Vietnam resign one month before the election so that they do not run the
                        election.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d41-14" facs="d41-14"/>
                    <p>So you see, Mr. Prime Minister, we have taken the matters you mentioned to us
                        to heart. And while we understand that you do not want to interfere in this
                        process, it is an interesting question whether one little country obsessed
                        with its suffering and obsessed with the war should be permitted to thwart
                        every progress because its suspicion is so great that it will not make a
                        negotiated settlement. Why should we want to maintain bases in one little
                        corner of Asia when the whole trend of our policy is to form a new
                        relationship with the most important country in Asia? If the leaders of
                        Vietnam ever spoke to us with anything approaching the largeness of spirit
                        that has been shown by you, Mr. Prime Minister, we could settle the war
                        within a matter of days.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I must tell you, in all honesty, we have made our last
                        offer. We cannot go further than we have gone. We believe that every
                        reasonable objective that Hanoi could have can be safeguarded. We want the
                        independence for the countries of Southeast Asia—the only countries who want
                        the war to continue are those who wish to create a bloc against you, not us,
                        whatever our original motive.</p>
                    <p>Hanoi has not yet replied to our last proposal, so we do not know what their
                        attitude is, but it is they who owe us an answer.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All American forces,
                        except the normal number in a military attache's office, which is very
                        small, will be out of the country during the month before the election. And
                        the election will be six months after a peace settlement. At this time there
                        will be no American forces in Vietnam except at the American Embassy.</p>
                    <p>I will be very specific so that you know the precise proposal if you are
                        interested. We have proposed that we sign immediately, in a matter of weeks,
                        a statement of principles on which a settlement should be based. We will
                        withdraw all American forces except a few thousand within seven months of
                        the signing of these principles, even if there is no peace treaty. We will
                        withdraw all American forces, even these few thousand that are left, within
                        six months of a peace settlement, of the final settlement. So we have given
                        them two versions that guarantee in effect our total withdrawal.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but there is also
                        the provision that the existing President and Vice President should resign
                        one month before the election.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The election is
                        confined to South Vietnam, because that is the only issue we have so far
                        negotiated with Hanoi. The cease-fire applies to all of Indochina. But that,
                        of course, includes our bombing also, air activity.</p>

                        from Indochina. He said that you shouldn't withdraw from places that he was

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That leaves either two
                        choices. He will either carry out his orders, or we will put someone else in

                        no good answer except to say that the qualities that make for heroism are

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But to take the nation as a
                        whole, it will finally temper itself to a fine degree. For instance,
                        Napoleon was a hero in war, but he failed in the end. But the revolutionary
                        spirit and tradition of France as a nation was preserved. The same as the
                        pioneer spirit which exists in your people's tradition. So every nation so
                        long as it exists has its good tradition and its strong points.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No question, and as I
                        told the Prime Minister last time, I personally admire the North
                        Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, I always think that if you
                        were to categorically withdraw it would be a glory to you and not a defeat.
                        General DeGaulle withdrew even more troops than you did and following that,
                        two million inhabitants withdrew from Algeria, and that was even more
                        difficult than if you were to do it now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He found someone to
                        negotiate with. The North Vietnamese are so suspicious, so convinced we are
                        trying to trick them, that either they would find a trick in our proposal,
                        or if they can't find a trick they have to reject it until they have found a
                        trick. There is a certain egocentricity about them. They believe we have
                        nothing else on our mind except how we can out-maneuver them. This isn't
                        true. We genuinely want to make peace with them and we genuinely want to
                        establish a basis of trust with them. If this were not true, and we were not
                        seeking a negotiated end, I wouldn't have come to Paris secretly on so many
                        occasions.</p>
                    <p>We will withdraw one way or the other. The only question is whether we will
                        withdraw more slowly or we will withdraw as the result of a negotiation.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But there is a historical reason
                        for the Vietnamese attitude, which I discussed with you the last time, that
                        is because they were taken in in 1954 during the Geneva Agreements.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand this, but
                        if they have learned a lesson from 1954, so should we have. The lesson they
                        have learned is they were tricked. The lesson we have learned is that if
                        they are tricked again they will fight again. No peace lasts unless the
                        countries it affects wish to maintain it. This is true in our relations and
                        it is true in our relations with North Vietnam.</p>

                        you want an all-around ceasefire, wouldn't that be equal to a freeze on the
                        situation? And then the Vietnamization program would continue?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, because the
                        government would resign and we would withdraw, and because we have
                        reformulated one of the points of Madame Binh. We are willing to accept
                        restrictions on the amount of military aid which we can give to South
                        Vietnam as part of the peace settlement.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Whatever the government
                        is, we will accept limitations on the amount of military and economic
                        assistance we can give. And finally, there is one point I have not yet
                        mentioned to the Prime Minister, which we have not put into the proposal
                        because we cannot accept the principle of paying an indemnity. But we have
                        said after the principles are agreed to we would, as an act of free will,
                        ask our Congress to earmark $7.5 billion for the reconstruction of
                        Indochina, of which $2 billion would be for North Vietnam. That is not a
                        formal proposal; that is a separate understanding, or rather a promise. That
                        is over a five-year period.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then there is a second question.
                        What will be the effect of all-around cease-fire on Cambodia? Wouldn't that
                        mean the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> clique would
                        remain?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't accept the
                        characterization of the Prime Minister. It means the political forces in
                        Cambodia will work themselves out over a period of time. If the North
                        Vietnamese forces withdrew from Cambodia, the question wouldn't arise at
                        all. But it would be unlikely that history would stop in Cambodia.</p>

                        clique is a clique that is reactionary to the extreme, and on this matter
                        perhaps our views differ greatly. And the Cambodian people want to continue
                        to work to overthrow it. What can you do about that? Like the Chinese people
                        worked to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>,
                        you can go on to aid them for three to five years. What will be its result?
                        The result will still be its collapse. How can you maintain Southeast Asia
                        as a region of peace and non-alignment?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the North Vietnamese
                        withdrew their forces from Cambodia it would be easy for us to accept
                        restrictions on the amount of military aid we can give to Cambodia, and then
                        the Cambodians can settle their future by themselves.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Our interest in
                        Cambodia has always been the presence of the North Vietnamese; it has never
                        been the Cambodian situation as such.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But this question was created
                        there in your invasion into Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know whether
                        the Prime Minister wants to debate history, but there were 50,000 North
                        Vietnamese in Cambodia before we went in there.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That was because the United
                        States troops went into South Vietnam and they had sympathy there for South
                        Vietnam. Even we didn't know about that. It was <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> himself who told me about this fact in this very
                        room. I was sitting in this chair; he was in the one you are in. That was
                        when he came to China in 1969 to celebrate our 20th anniversary. He came as
                        the Prime Minister of Cambodia, and I was greatly surprised and taken aback
                        by that fact. Because I know first of all that Sihanouk believed in Buddhism
                        and was peace-loving. The second fact was that he was pro-French, although
                        very friendly toward China. Because we are good friends, he also wrote some
                        good poetry in memory of our friendship. But his politics and his life were
                        both French still.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But because he sympathized with
                        the South Vietnamese people who had been pushed into war for 10 years, he
                        allowed some of their troops to use the eastern part of Cambodia to maneuver
                        their troops. He didn't even tell us. It was in 1969 when I was talking with
                        him in this room that <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> told me
                        about it. It was upon hearing this I said this Prince is truly remarkable.
                        And Sihanouk had this sympathy for them. <pb n="21" xml:id="d41-21" facs="d41-21"/>But the United States has no reason to rebuke Sihanouk,
                        nor does the United States have any reason to rebuke the North Vietnamese
                        for assisting their compatriots in South Vietnam. Because in 1954 after the
                        Geneva Conference, they withdrew their armed fighters and they did so very
                        scrupulously, in good faith.</p>
                    <p>After we reached agreement on the announcement last July the first country we
                        went to was Hanoi. I told them about our meeting so there would be no
                        misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>At that time (1954) <persName corresp="#p_LD1">Le Duan</persName> and Pham
                        Van Dong, who were both from the south, said it had been a very painful
                        experience for them to persuade their fellows in the south to withdraw to
                        the north with their weapons and leave their families in the south. At that
                        time <persName corresp="#p_LD1">Le Duan</persName> had asked to remain in
                        the south. He was confident that after 30 years the revolution in the south
                        would be successful. Because he saw it was difficult for these fighters to
                        leave their families. They were only able to persuade their fighters to go
                        because of the prestige of Premier <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi
                            Minh</persName>. Because it was stipulated in the Geneva Agreements that
                        one year after the Conference, representatives of the North and the South
                        would meet and discuss a way of holding elections under the provisions of
                        the agreement to unify Vietnam, and it was on the basis of this that they
                        persuaded fighters to withdraw to North Vietnam, though they left their
                        families. They believed that soon after they would be able to hold
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>And I believe you also believe that if elections had been held, Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi Minh</persName> would have been
                        elected. John Foster Dulles said so, as did many others. But this was false,
                        dirty, what Dulles did, and even <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                        wrote about it in his memoirs! He said, “I won't sign this. I will issue a
                        statement saying I will not disturb the agreement.” But it was he himself
                        who disturbed the agreements, and he told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> wrote
                        in his memoirs that this was false and that after the Geneva Conference they
                        had immediately worked with the Southeast Asians. They had worked on a
                        policy of brinkmanship… they had drawn a line. He believed in a philosophy
                        you no longer believe in, that he thought they could draw a circle around
                        the communist countries to contain them as if all the socialist countries
                        were one monolith.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d41-22" facs="d41-22"/>
                    <p>But that is not true. On the other hand, they believed once they drew a line
                        all the countries on their side would also be a monolith. But that is not
                        possible either. Even those in South Vietnam would not listen to them. The
                        U. S. sent in military advisors, military forces, and it was this thing that
                        gave rise to the war of aggression in South Vietnam. And it was these
                        members of families of fighters who had gone to the north that rose up to
                        fight against this aggression. Why should such an indomitable nation not be
                        allowed to be independent?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But no one is keeping
                        them from being independent now. Whatever the reading of history, we now
                        have the wisdom to make a peace that accords with these national
                        aspirations. They have proved they will fight; they no longer need show it.
                        Their guarantee is not this or that clause or proposal; their guarantee is
                        that there is a completely different world outlook between Dulles' policy
                        and our policy. In 1954, the United States was getting engaged; in 1971 our
                        approach is quite different. If we wanted to pursue the Dulles policy, I
                        wouldn't be talking to you. Therefore, if we want to pursue peace in
                        Indochina now it will not be for reasons of intervention, but for peace over
                        the longer term.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Anyway, there is a knot in your
                        negotiations that hasn't been untied.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is true.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because they believe that your
                        tendency is to assist <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SM4">Sirik Matak</persName>, and Tam. So on this question
                        if you don't take a fair attitude, they won't understand you.</p>
                    <p>For instance, if you now were to assist <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> to come back to the mainland, or separate Taiwan
                        from the mainland into an independent state, how could we understand?
                        Because you wish no such policy and because we know your President wishes to
                        change this situation in the world, we have a common point.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But this proves my
                        point, because our basic attitude toward Vietnam summarizes our attitude
                        toward you, and if they showed us that minimum degree of confidence we could
                        end the war very quickly. Because we have shown them a way by which both the
                        military and political problem can be resolved. But they must leave
                        something to the political process; they cannot ask us to surrender to
                        them.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="d41-23" facs="d41-23"/>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is not surrender. DeGaulle
                        withdrew his troops on his own initiative, and the whole world believed it
                        was a glorious thing. And if your President wishes to win the respect of the
                        world, withdrawal of your troops from Indochina would be a great action
                        indeed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But as I have
                        explained, that is what we have offered. The question is whether Hanoi will
                        negotiate on this basis. Withdrawal is not the issue. We have offered the
                        most generous terms possible and the only reason we have not published them
                        is because we want to make peace and not propaganda. But I am fairly
                        optimistic that they will accept our last proposal.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I don't know the content of your
                        final proposal, so there is no way for me to say anything on this. What I
                        want to tell you is the mental state they are in. They are in a state of
                        war, of being submitted to aggression. They are not like China. China is so
                        big that though there are a million troops on our northern frontiers, among
                        which three hundred thousand have entered into the People's Republic of
                        Mongolia, spearheaded against China; and though there is no withdrawal yet
                        from Taiwan and <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> makes
                        a great cry about returning; and though some Japanese militarists are making
                        great cry about self-defense, they want their self-defense troops to go
                        abroad; although such a situation exists and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MCAJS1">McCain</persName> is saying loudly his troops in
                        the Pacific should do this and that…</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the Prime Minister
                        faces no greater threat than that, he is in good shape.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I just added that as one more
                        example. If I were to add more that would be the Soviet Union and India. But
                        Madame Gandhi says this is not spearheaded against any country, and India is
                        still non-aligned. Although the situation is such, we still recognize the
                        times have changed and we should look at the future.</p>
                    <p>But you cannot rebuke the 14 million people of South Vietnam who are
                        suffering in the extreme misery at the present for not accepting anything
                        they do not feel is safe. There is no reason to rebuke them for that; they
                        should feel safe. It is about the same situation George Washington was in
                        200 years ago. How many did you have at that time?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Three million.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And with such a small population
                        they dared to defy the British Empire because they had no way out. That also
                        was a kind of guerrilla warfare, I think, and it was three years afterward
                        he was elected commander-in-chief. But in the end your ancestors won. The
                        pioneer spirit was victorious. So when we think of the experiences of our
                        own nations we should sympathize with the miseries of others. So you should
                        do your utmost to let them see your policy as truly changed. But if it was
                        only us, it would be impossible for us to say this to them, because we are
                        in a different position; we are not participants.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And also there are people on the
                        side, as you said, doing their best to provoke things.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are well aware of
                        this.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So we hope you will also
                        consider this because when your President comes there must be some clause
                        dealing with this and wouldn't it be a good thing if by the time he came it
                        had been settled? I don't mean everything has been settled, but there should
                        be an agreement. That would be a great victory and glory to you. I don't
                        think it would be a defeat.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have taken seven
                        secret trips to Paris this year, which is not my principal job, to try to
                        make peace. We want to make peace. Continuation of the war is not in the
                        interest of the U.S. or China. Continuation of the war can only help outside
                        countries. We are no long-term threat to the independence of Vietnam in any
                        concept of the future of Asia. We want to make peace.</p>
                    <p>We also recognize there are limits to what you want to do and what you can
                        do, because we know there are outside forces encouraging continuation of the
                        war for reasons unrelated to Vietnam, but related to rivalries and
                        ambitions. But if an opportunity presents itself in which you might be asked
                        about the degree of our sincerity, without telling us, you could perhaps
                        offer your opinion as to the degree of our sincerity.</p>
                    <p>We'll do what we can, but in all frankness we cannot go further than the
                        proposal of October 11 to which they have not responded.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I haven't read the document of
                        October 11 yet, so I cannot say anything on that. I only said a few words on
                        the matter of all-around cease-fire. I can think over the question more and
                        maybe later on I can say more about it, because I think it would be
                        impossible to say nothing about this matter in the communique.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the other hand, you
                        should be under no misapprehension. Vietnam is a subject of extreme
                        sensitivity to us, and it is impossible for us to accept a communique which
                        is critical of us. We can, of course, accept silence, but we cannot accept a
                        communique which can be construed as an attack on us.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But the declaration of
                        withdrawal of troops from Indochina by a United States President, wouldn't
                        that be something worthy of the hailing of the people of the world? Because
                        the people of the whole world in many countries have been asking you to take
                        such a step. If you did so, wouldn't that be worthy of the acclaim of the
                        people of the world? Why is it impossible for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to do something it was possible for
                        General DeGaulle to do?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: President DeGaulle
                        found a party on the other side prepared to negotiate. We have up to now not
                        found it possible to get the agreement of the other side to a
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But if the United States were to
                        take the initiative in declaring a withdrawal, wouldn't that win the support
                        of the people of the world, including the United States?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our belief has been
                        that we could not do this as a propaganda exercise. We could get favorable
                        headlines for two or three months, but these victories are empty.</p>

                        necessarily so. Haven't you said your policy has been determined?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but if we announce
                        something Hanoi then rejects, your problem will not be any easier. You can
                        still not support our position in a communique.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, it cannot be written
                        into a communique if you don't reach an agreement with Hanoi. Of course,
                        first of all it is hoped your two sides will come to a conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will try very
                        hard.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because this is the most urgent
                        matter in the relaxation of tension in the Far East. This will benefit
                        people of Indochina, and neither will it be detrimental to the glory of the
                        United States. In my view it will make the United States even more
                        glorious.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand the Prime
                        Minister's point of view, and have explained our point of view. The only
                        reason I do not give the Prime Minister our formal proposal is because we
                        feel since we are negotiating secretly with Hanoi, it is not proper for me
                        to give you our documents, because if we were negotiating with you, you
                        would not appreciate our giving our private documents to other countries.
                        But if Hanoi gave it to you, we would be very pleased.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will take what the

                        work out as we both hope that we will find some understanding, if not, of

                        are trying to do even though we understand that you will support your

                        others.</p>
                    <p>The relations between our two countries have been cut off many years. The
                        style of our words is very straightforward and there is not so much
                        reluctance, and there does not arise the question of imposing will on each
                        other. And this is what Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        teaches us, not to impose our will on others. Because the conditions and
                        history of each country are different, and even though their world outlooks
                        may be similar in general, there may be differences in their ways of
                        thinking and their style. And each has their own experience of struggle, and
                        it is through this experience that progress is made. Why is it the world is
                        not tranquil, not only the western world, the so-called socialist world as
                        well? There are all kinds of socialism. And this proves the bankruptcy of
                        Dulles' policy. Both of us are attacking Dulles' policy in front of our
                        other American friends. I hope they don't see that as unforgivable.</p>

                    <p>The President asked about your response to his desire for private sessions
                        with <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and I gave him the essence of your
                        discussions with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> on the subject.
                        The President asked that I wire you immediately and confirm that he was most
                        comfortable with a meeting with both <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> together
                        but insisted that the session include him only on the U.S. side. <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> informs me that if a meeting of
                        this type is held simultaneously with both leaders then there is no
                        requirement for a separate private session between the President and
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. He agrees with me,
                        however, that since you have already requested such a meeting that he will
                        leave this issue to your judgment in light of your assessment of conditions
                        there.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that if “anyone else” were present this would differ
                        from the style he has established in his trips abroad and, more importantly,
                        would raise the “<persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> problem.”
                        There may be more to this than that simple explanation and I suspect the
                        Sherman story in Sunday's Post which touched upon the genesis of the Peking
                        and Soviet initiatives was not helpful in any sense. You will recall that
                        Sherman suggested that both trips had long been part of “your” conceptual
                        agenda.</p>
                    <p>I hope to speak to the President this morning about the Middle <pb n="2" xml:id="d42-02" facs="d42-02"/>East problem and its implications. He
                        spent all day yesterday preparing for the TV announcement of the two Supreme
                        Court appointments.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Yesterday morning we had a
                        meeting which has been carried out in accordance with procedures agreed upon
                        by Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. And to speak frankly,
                        I didn't expect what kind of questions the United States side put forward
                        before the meeting. But you have made very good preparations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: All very tentative.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: And only during the course of
                        our exchanges of views have I come to realize the nature and contents of the
                        questions you have put forward. That is why yesterday morning I mainly
                        listened to what you have got to say. And in the course of our talk I made a
                        very brief clarification. That is to say both Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> must be very familiar with the whole process of
                        the Sino-United States talks so far as the consistent stand of China. And
                        there is much content in this sentence. I think both of you will understand
                        it. And after the meeting I joined another meeting in the afternoon and in
                        the evening we also attended the performances and in the morning we went on
                        an excursion to the Great Wall. So to speak frankly I haven't read over the
                        list you handed over to us. Because we haven't got enough time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We fully understand. You have been so gracious
                        in affording us so pleasant and profitable a time, we fully understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: So we are not in the same
                        circumstances. So I would like to say a few words about my preliminary
                        ideas. Of course, we will report our respective preliminary ideas to our
                        respective leaders.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d43-02" facs="d43-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Certainly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: And of course eventually it
                        will be solved by Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                        and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: this is just for
                        exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think that would be very useful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: It's not a decision, just an
                        exchange of ideas.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Yesterday, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> had raised some points on the
                        contacts between China and the United States. I haven't got a note here;
                        this is a translation of your proposals.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: It looks far more concrete
                        in the form that you have it there than in the way that I presented it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: That's the Chinese characters.
                        The way they print it gives you the impression.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: You must assume that the
                        way we talked about it yesterday was very informal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Just an exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: So what I am going to touch on
                        is first of all the questions of the contacts between China and the United
                        States as was mentioned yesterday by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>. And yesterday Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> also mentioned that there had already been
                        established effective contacts between Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> so I am not going to talk at length on this point. Of
                        course, it goes without saying such contacts will go on. And in addition to
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> had made three
                        suggestions for the consideration of the Chinese side. Because I haven't
                        brought the note with me, if I don't speak very accurately please correct
                        me. The first point is to establish, on the basis of reciprocity, a liaison
                        office by both sides.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: May I make one statement
                        here? We said reciprocity if the Chinese government is interested in
                        reciprocity.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d43-03" facs="d43-03"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Of course I mentioned just now
                        your suggestions are for the consideration of the Chinese side. So it's all
                        right if I didn't mention that point. We think this is not realistic. It is
                        quite obvious there is a so-called embassy of the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique in Washington. And as regards this,
                        we haven't ___________ to the United States. If any situation of two Chinas
                        occurs then it is utterly unacceptable to us. That is if there is a
                        so-called Kuomintang Embassy in Washington and at the same time there is a
                        so-called kind of liaison organization whether official or non-official of
                        the Peoples Republic of China in Washington. And it goes without saying it
                        is not appropriate. And we are not willing to put the United States side in
                        an embarrassing state and wish the United States side will also not put us
                        in an embarrassing state. That is why I say that as for the first point, it
                        is not feasible.</p>
                    <p>As for the second suggestion, it is to establish a section in a friendly
                        embassy on both sides. And on this there is some sort of similarity between
                        this point and the last suggestion. We are used to doing things in a frank
                        and open way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That we welcome.</p>
                    <p>Hsiang: I don't mean to make any criticism of U.S. representation at missions
                        in the Middle East, but that's not our practice. That's why the second
                        suggestion is also not feasible. As for the sort of suggestion about the
                        sending of sort of technical personnel to deal with administrative questions
                        before or during or after the visits of senior representatives of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> either from Hong Kong or from
                        Washington. As for this point, we think it can be considered.
                        ________________ in July Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> came here to China and this time he has come again
                        and with even a larger party. And the period for your stay is for you to
                        decide. Of course, it is impossible for you to stay for a longer time.
                        Because Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has told me
                        that he is going to leave on the 25th. So shall we put this question on a
                        more realistic basis. So from the 25th of this month when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and his colleagues are leaving
                        China to the date of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China there is still quite a few months, about
                        four or five months. Plus, the final date is not yet known, for during this
                        period of time the United States side thinks it is necessary to send some
                        people here to China we think it can be taken into consideration. If there
                        is some other preparatory work to be done in that case, this can be realized
                        through the channels mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> yesterday. As to who will come or how many of them
                        will come, and how long they are going to stay, it can be consulted and
                        agreed upon through the channels which already exist. But we think it is
                        better and more effective to send a representative right from Washington. As
                        for the function of the personnel and Hong Kong, I am sure that both you and
                        they in Hong Kong are very clear about the function of them. It's a very big
                        consulate. If they came here, it will affect their <pb n="4" xml:id="d43-04" facs="d43-04"/>function in Hong Kong. So we think in that case it will
                        be more effective to send representatives right from Washington although
                        they only deal with administrative work, but it is more effective to send
                        them right from Washington, the personnel, not the senior representatives,
                        but the personnel. It is more realistic to have them during the period after
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s interim visit and
                        before President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        China. As for the contacts after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China, we can leave it to them to decide.
                        What would you think of such an idea?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Certainly this is
                        something we want to consider and discuss with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and we appreciate the
                        receptivity of the Peoples Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What is your opinion?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I think that certainly my
                        contacts … I think this will be beneficial and be helpful to others who come
                        of higher rank, to have this assistance on the groundwork so to speak. This
                        of course is my personal opinion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What I was referring to is the
                        period after Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s interim
                        visit to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I don't believe Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has yet formed any
                        particular idea on what type of contact or further conversations we should
                        have in that period. At this point I am not in a position to comment any
                        further. At this point it will depend on what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> should discuss.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Because this is the third
                        suggestion you made yesterday, so that's what I have considered because I
                        have put it on a more realistic basis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I do recall offering to
                        receive any suggestions from the People's Republic of China and wonder if
                        your side has any suggestions to make going beyond what I said
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I think as for this point it
                        is in conformity with the point put forward by Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> last July.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Fine, I have nothing
                        further to say then.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Now, the second question. That
                        is the question put forward by Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>. That is the
                        proposal on the exchanges of scientific, technical and cultural and so
                        forth. I think altogether there are 25 proposals.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d43-05" facs="d43-05"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: May I say these were very illustrative, and we
                        didn't have any idea we'd want to consider them as a package, but simply to
                        start our thinking going.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Last time you mentioned three
                        proposals orally; as for the written list, it consists of 25. Of course last
                        time you did mention the three suggestions were just illustrative. My idea
                        is like this: The Chinese and the American peoples have long been friendly
                        to each other, and owing to reasons not because of the Chinese side, for the
                        last 2-1/2 years, and more, the exchanges between the two countries have
                        been cut off. A new page has been opened after the visits of the American
                        table tennis team to China in last April. Of course, before that there were
                        a few American friends who have come to China, say Mr. ___________. And
                        after the visit of the table tennis team from the United States there has
                        been an increasing number of the American friends who have come to China for
                        visits and many of them include correspondents. Of course, there were also
                        correspondents who came with the table tennis players and after their visit
                        there have been a number of correspondents who have come and also tourists
                        and scientists and so on. That's why in his toast at the banquet Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> also mentioned that
                        the contacts between the Chinese and American people are bound to develop. I
                        think you are also clear on this point. But so far, it's American friends
                        and American people who have come to China. And from April up to now it's
                        one-way traffic. And of course, the American Table Tennis Association also
                        has invited the Chinese Table Tennis Association to visit the United States.
                        And our Chinese Table Tennis Association is most thankful to the American
                        Table Tennis Association. And we have also noticed that in last August the
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique had also
                        sent its table tennis team to the United States and they visited many
                        cities. They visited more than 20 cities and finally they arrived in
                        Washington. And we are very thankful to the American Table Tennis
                        Association who refused to play with them. They refused to have any matches
                        with the Chiang Kai-shek table tennis team.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I recall that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: There were still people who,
                        although not members of the Table Tennis Association, they did play with the
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> table tennis team.
                        I cite this question just to illustrate that there is a political factor to
                        the question of contacts.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: May I say something here?
                        This brings up precisely the point we were making yesterday. There are those
                        in the United States who are very critical of the policy established by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, doing their best to
                        interfere with the normalization of relations and this is an illustration.
                            <pb n="6" xml:id="d43-06" facs="d43-06"/>This visit of the table tennis
                        team from Taiwan was arranged by the groups critical of the President's
                        policy, and the United States Government had nothing to do with the visit of
                        the group from Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I would like to make two
                        points of comment on this. Firstly, we would not like to put the United
                        States in an embarrassing state, nor do we wish that the United States will
                        put us in an embarrassing state. If we have to take into consideration that
                        aspect of the picture, why didn't you take into consideration this side of
                        the picture? And the second point is to say the United States Government has
                        nothing to do with the invitation of the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> table tennis team is only to speak of the picture.
                        We have all engaged in diplomatic work. First of all, you have to give them
                        a visa, and a visa doesn't come from non-governmental organizations, and
                        prior to that it is clearly written in United States passports they are not
                        permitted to come to the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: I don't understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: In your American
                        passports.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: That's incorrect. Since 15
                        March, there are not more restrictions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Prior to that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: What we should talk about
                        now is not the past but the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: I was just making comments on
                        the fact that you mention your government has nothing to do with invitation
                        of the Chiang Kai-shek table tennis clique to the United States. Because
                        prior to that your government has laid down rules to which countries they
                        are allowed to issue passports for U.S. citizens. And for the people of
                        other countries to go b the United States, they have got to get visas from
                        the U.S. side. Without visas, how could they go to the United States? Who
                        would issue the visas, and also as to when to issue the visas, it is up to
                        the United States government organizations to decide. If the Chinese Table
                        Tennis Team also went to the United States in August then in that way they
                        would have been put in a more embarrassing position. The State Department
                        ______________ refused to issue visas to the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> team.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: But this was apprivate
                        arrangement, and for the government to do that would have been a distinct
                        political act.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: This is a political act?</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d43-07" facs="d43-07"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Not to act is a political
                        act.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: This is a political question.
                        Whether you issue the visa or not is a political question. You can't ignore
                        this point. Whether this side or that side, it is always a political
                        consideration. That's why I said in these circumstances as for your
                        suggestions as to exchange between the two countries it would be impossible
                        to be conducted on a governmental basis. That is to say, subsidiary
                        questions have to be subordinated to the fundamental questions. This is our
                        consistent fundamental stand in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in
                        Warsaw.</p>
                    <p>Of course, after the publication of the announcement, after Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s July visit to China, it is
                        clearly stated in the announcement that we are seeking the normalization of
                        the relations between the two countries. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit is to seek the normalization
                        of the relations between the two countries. So in these circumstances it can
                        be considered that the cultural, scientific and technical exchanges can be
                        conducted on a private basis, but it can't be too much because up to now the
                        relations between our two countries have not been normalized. There is still
                        the Taiwan question. So it can be considered to conduct exchanges on a
                        non-governmental basis, but there cannot be too much of this. What I
                        referred to as exchanges, as for exchanges ov visits between the two
                        peoples, as Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> has
                        mentioned, this is bound to develop. As to which proposals out of these 25
                        proposals can be conducted in either the present or the near future, these
                        can be discussed. And generally speaking, this kind of exchanges will be put
                        on a non-governmental basis and there can be not too many of them. That is
                        my preliminary idea.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: It is perfectly agreeable to us that these
                        exchanges be on a non-governmental basis, and we think that it is reasonable
                        that progress in this area be step-by-step. I think that our leaders have
                        both expressed the idea that an eventual increase in such things is
                        virtually inevitable, and this is something we can look forward to in the
                        future if things go well in the interim. I think it is acceptable for there
                        to be a somewhat modest beginning, but the important thing is that there be
                        a beginning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Such exchanges can be
                        realized, but as for whether it will be mentioned in the joint communique
                        after the visit made by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, that is the joint communique issued during President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit this is not up to
                        me (if there is any communique). This is another matter. It is up to Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to consider it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, we agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: So what I have mentioned and
                        whether the joint communique should refer to this is two matters.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d43-08" facs="d43-08"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, I understand that. We agree. I want to
                        emphasize that this rather large package of illustrative suggestions is by
                        no means exclusive. Any idea you have that is not in this we would, of
                        course, be very interested in considering also.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What I have said just now,
                        when you handed over this list I haven't thought it over before that. I
                        don't know whether our comrade from the Foreign Ministry has thought it over
                        or not.</p>
                    <p>___________: Then I will consider it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: But when our Foreign Ministry
                        is going to explain this to the departments concerned, they have to provide
                        some sort of information to them to ___________ further exploration.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think the proposals as we gave them are
                        about as detailed as we can go into now, because they cover so many fields
                        that none of us are real specialists in these fields, and I think we need to
                        come to some general agreement as to where we are going in the field and
                        then we can prepare more detailed studies on any of these items which we
                        find to be of mutual interest. I think when you have time and an opportunity
                        to study what we have given you that you will find we have indicated fairly
                        clearly what types of steps we are prepared to take in general and in most
                        instances we have indicated the type of organization in the United States
                        which we think would be primarily concerned with them. But that is not fixed
                        either. We can describe to you the facilities and types of experience which
                        these organizations have which might be of interest to you and then move on
                        from there on which _____ you might wish to follow up on.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: According to your concept,
                        your ideas, would such kind of contacts be carried out by the method of
                        direct contact between non-government organizations on our side and in your
                        country, or by the government.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Either way is satisfactory to us. I think it
                        would be a little easier if the government were in the picture, because as I
                        mentioned earlier of the multi-faceted nature of this many types of
                        atheletic, cultural and ecientific associations we have. But it is also
                        perfectly acceptable to us to ______________________________________. If
                        that is done you may wish to consult with us concerning the facilities,
                        reputation, etc. of these organizations to better understand what they would
                        be able to do and perhaps what they would not be able to do.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d43-09" facs="d43-09"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Because these proposals were
                        put forward by your side, that is why I think I would like to clarify some
                        points. To make clear some of the points which I can conceive at the moment.
                        So it's not a matter of suggestions put forward by our side which are
                        satisfactory to you. I just want to make clear on certain points. Just now
                        you said it would be better to have the government in the picture. What
                        organizations do you refer to?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I am saying it would probably be easier for us
                        if, for instance, at least as sort of a clearing house the Communist Affairs
                        Office of our State Department were involved. However, if you don't wish it
                        that way it is agreeable to us. It might facilitate matters, but if for
                        political reasons you prefer to have it not that way, that is agreeable. Or
                        similarly, our United States Information Agency would be a normal clearing
                        house for journalists or things of that nature, but we would not insist upon
                        it. As a matter of fact, we can furnish you a list of names of any number of
                        organizations in the United States which would be entirely non-governmental
                        and if you prefer you can make your arrangements with these organizations
                        without governmental activity on our part.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Other than to facilitate
                        the issuance of visas.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What do you think of the
                        prestige of the United States Information Agency in other countries?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think I would rather not address that
                        question today if you don't mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: To increase our mutual
                        understanding, I would like to ask how many sections are under your State
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: In the State Department we have several
                        bureaus. There must be six geographical bureaus in the world.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Bureaus?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: And secretaries?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: There's a secretary, an under secretary, an
                        under secretary for political affairs.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d43-10" facs="d43-10"/>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>:</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That's right. Then Assistant Secretaries who
                        head bureaus. There are six geographic bureaus.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Would the assistant secretary
                        also be the head of the geographic bureau?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: That is correct. Also several functional
                        bureaus at the same level as geographic bureaus. For instance, the Bureau of
                        Economic Affairs, the Bureau of International Organizational Affairs which
                        handles U.S. affairs …</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Cultural affairs?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Bureau of Cultural Affairs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: How many bureaus are there

                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I would guess ten, maybe twelve, but I would
                        say ten.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: We would have to count
                        up.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Approximately ten.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Including the functional

                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Not a bureau.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Not a bureau, it's an office. I have 11 people
                        in my office.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: And a desk in the office?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: There are several officers within one office.
                        It varies. Some officers are large; some are smaller in number of personnel.
                        An office includes several offices.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: That means for instance if you
                        want to contact an Asian country aside from regional bureaus you make
                        contacts through the cultural bureau if it is in cultural affairs and
                        contact the economic affairs bureau if it is in economic affairs. Is this
                        world wide?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Yes, but the normal point of contact for
                        official representatives in Washington would be the geographical bureau
                        usually. The geographical bureau then works closely with those functional
                        bureaus.</p>
                    <p>Hisung: I am not very familiar with this. That is why I asked. Which bureau
                        is in charge of issuing visas? Is there a special bureau in charge of
                        it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I don't think it's called a bureau; it's an
                        office.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Security and consular
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: And in that is the passport office and the
                        visa office. I do have one other topic I would like briefly to mention
                        before the break if that is agreeable, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said if we finished here before the other meeting

                        want to know if that's agreeable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: We can do it according to Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s wish.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Hsiuing: When shall we stop?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Whenever we have finished what we need to do.
                        It's not specific.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: If that's the case then we can
                        take some refreshments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I mentioned very briefly at our previous
                        meeting the subject of trade. I don't know to what extent you want to
                        discuss that subject now. We are prepared to discuss it if you wish. I would
                        like to mention one matter which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has asked me to say and that is that we are
                        prepared to enlarge our general list of trade items to the limit of our
                        present laws before the President's visit to China and we are prepared to do
                        that without any conditions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Personally, I am not
                        interested in this question. This morning on the way back from the Ming
                        Tombs as our Acting Foreign Minister was preoccupied with some other work,
                        he said goodbye to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        early so I was in the same car with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and he also mentioned that the withdrawal of the
                        Soviet exports greatly affected China. I said that we are most grateful to
                        Khrushchev. Because in acting that way he had enabled us to carry out
                        Chairman Mao's policy of self-reliance even more rapidly. But first of all,
                        we must give thanks to the United States policy of embargo. First _______ it
                        was the United States who imposed embargo on China and then it was
                        Khrushchev who removed Soviet exports and _________ the agreements, and it
                        was a good thing because we don't care for such things. In this way we have
                        developed even more rapidly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We certainly respect self-reliance, and we
                        understand your feelings on that score. We feel that even though the United
                        States too is able to be self-reliant, we would profit too from mutual trade
                        with others quite apart from the ability to be self-reliant. And we feel
                        this area also leads to increased understanding between peoples, and to the
                        further inhancing of their economic status and the livelihood of their
                        people. But we fully understand your justifiable pride in self-reliance and
                        we respect that attitude.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: While saying self-reliant, we
                        also have trade relations with many countries on the basis of ______ and
                        mutual benefit and supplying each other what it needs. But as for Sino-U.S.
                        trade, at present conditions are not yet right. That is my opinion; that is
                        why I am not interested in this question.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d43-13" facs="d43-13"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We will not press it. I had mentioned it as
                        another possible area to supplement exchanges we have spoken of and I would
                        like to say again that we consider whatever you are ready to discuss in
                        these areas as contributing to making movement possible in the fundamental
                        issues. We would not want to use these terms “subsidiary” questions as any
                        diversion from facing the fundamental questions, but it makes it easier for
                        us to approach normalization of relations if we can show our detractors from
                        our present policy that tangible progress is possible without conditions
                        attached to it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: But the normalization of the
                        Sino-American relations is conditional.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Would Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> enlarge on that comment?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: That means the normalization
                        of relations between the countries cannot be carried out without
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I understand what you mean, and our principals
                        are talking about the fundamental issues.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: That is why before the
                        normalization of relations between the two countries is realized many
                        matters have to be handled in the circumstances when our relations have not
                        yet been normalized.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We understand that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: Out of courteous reasons we
                        are ready to listen to whatever ideas you would like to put forward, but as
                        to the question of trade, I am not interested. But you can put forward your
                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Of course it makes it difficult to express any
                        specific proposals if we are told there is no interest. I would not like to
                        press this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: What I mean is if you have any
                        ideas you can put them forward and if not then it is not necessary for you
                        to speak.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We could offer ideas if there were interest
                        expressed in them but I am not sure it would be fruitful if there is no
                        interest in the subject.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: It is not necessary that
                        everything will be fruitful. We can exchange views and exchange our ideas. I
                        am willing to listen.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I think perhaps we can address this
                        letter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName>: We will break now then.</p>

                        a certain stage in our political discussions today. I think the main issues
                        that remain to be discussed are Korea, Japan, and the issue of the
                        subcontinent of Asia. I have heard that your preference is to speak about
                        the questions of relations between the U.S. and Soviet Union, or the Soviet
                        Union, at a more general meeting and we agree and think it will be all
                        right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My preference is to
                        discuss the Soviet Union at a more restricted meeting while Japan and Korea

                        one from our side from Harvard. No one else has studied in the United

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Harvard concentrates
                        more on social sciences so it's not fair to compare. It is probably more

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have a piece of news that a
                        U.S. electronic reconnaissance plane is often carrying out reconnaissance
                        over Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is high altitude,
                        30,000 meters, a high altitude reconnaissance plane that takes pictures
                        electronically.</p>
                    <p>In the past there have been planes of this kind that have passed through the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam and passed into Chinese air space—a few
                        kilometers into it and back into Vietnam. Our orders are that any military
                        airplane that intrudes into China air space should be fired at. Our radar
                        today found that there were such planes which had gone from Laos into the
                        northern part of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in an area quite close
                        to Chinese borders.</p>
                    <p>So as we have received news of this event today we would like to give it to
                        you for your attention, and it would not be good with either side if such a
                        thing occurs during your visit here. So I have ordered them that if there's
                        a bit of an intrusion on a very small scale that we should be informed
                        first. We hope that you will also notify your side so that nothing will
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate your
                        frankness. I will get a message off as soon as I get back to the guest
                        house, calling the attention of Washington to this conversation. I can
                        assure you that no ambiguous event will occur after that message is
                        received.</p>
                    <p>I would also like to tell the Prime Minister that after my return in July we
                        reviewed those intelligence activities and did away with those that could be
                        construed as having a provocative character. We will review them again, but
                        there are no overflights of the People's Republic of China authorized. If
                        any should occur, which I do not believe,but if they should, it will be an
                        unauthorized action with which we will deal severely. We would
                        appreciate—we, of course, understand you will take action if there's <pb n="4" xml:id="d44-04" facs="d44-04"/>an overflight. If for any reason
                        you do not and let us know the details—the time and place and altitude or
                        type of plane—we will take appropriate action. I have enough about this; I
                        don't need more detail on this. If there should be any others, they are not
                        authorized, but should they occur let us know through our channel and we
                        will take immediate action.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And we will inform you of such
                        things if there is time. For instance, you are here now but if there's no
                        time —</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. You
                        reserve the right to take action if there's a flight over China, but if you
                        will tell us if it occurs, we will prevent it's reoccurrence. In any event,
                        I will look into this question again after I return and make sure there's no
                        such action. It has already been prohibited, but you can never be sure about
                        every commander.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The area in which such instances
                        happen most is Hainan Island, Kwantung province and the Chinese-Vietnam and
                        Chinese-Laos borders.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are all <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>-1 high altitude planes.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will get a message
                        off when I return to the guest house, and when I return I will again review
                        the whole situation. It's not our policy to have intrusion over Chinese air
                        space.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would like to say something on
                        the Korean situation. Perhaps in your preparations you did not take so much
                        attention to this issue, but to us this is an issue that has not yet been
                        settled and it's now an issue where a new crisis may now arise. The reason
                        is that though a ceasefire has been reached in the Korean war, no new treaty
                        has ever been concluded or no new arrangement. I have already mentioned the
                        situation of the 1954 Geneva Conference. During that conference we made
                        attempts to settle this issue but no results whatsoever were reached. And
                        now in Panmunjom there is a meeting of the two sides of the armistice, and
                        there is also a stretch of the demilitarized area in the zone. There is also
                        a four country group composed on the northern Korean side by Poland and
                        Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland and Sweden on the side of the United States.
                        Taking part in the meetings on the southern side is the U.S. representative
                        as chief, with the South Korean as his deputy. On the northern side the
                        Korean representative is the main representative and the Chinese
                        representative is his deputy. <pb n="5" xml:id="d44-05" facs="d44-05"/>This
                        is a treaty that has not yet reached a status of peace. This is an unstable
                        state of affairs and often there are incursions into one's territory and
                        other conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Also every year when the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meets it also
                        discusses the Korean Question. When those discussions are heard the
                        committee is partial. It doesn't allow the Democratic People's Republic of
                        Korea to be represented. Of course, China is not there because China is not
                        a member. There is such a commission in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the United Nations Commission for the Unification and
                        Rehabilitation of Korea.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know what the Prime
                        Minister is talking about.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The Democratic People's Republic
                        of Korea has requested to participate in the discussion in the United
                        Nations and was not allowed to do so, but was only invited to do so with
                        conditions attached. It's only this year that meetings have been held
                        between South and North Korea to deal with correspondence and visiting
                        between families in North and South Korea. It was held between the Red Cross
                        representatives at Panmunjom.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think our discussions
                        in July helped on this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Perhaps, because it was proposed
                        by the South Korean Red Cross. As a result the Democratic People's Republic
                        of Korea immediately responded to this proposal. Initial meetings were held
                        altogether five times. And then they held preparatory meetings five times up
                        to your arrival. Altogether ten meetings. They reached an agreement that the
                        two sides first meet in Panmunjom and then alternately in Pyongyang and
                        Seoul, the two capitals. Agreement was only reached on the place where the
                        meetings should be held, not on another matter. It will probably be a
                        marathon meeting. This has almost become a law of the meetings. These
                        meetings are a step forward from the previous state of affairs. And then it
                        was proposed by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I believe by the
                        U.S., that discussions should not be held this year but postponed to next
                        year. But the Korean question still exists both on the agenda of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in reality.</p>
                    <p>Our stand is that the United States military forces should withdraw from
                        Korea because Chinese forces have been gone from North Korea since 1958, as
                        I said before. Of course, the United States has taken out more than
                        one-third of its forces. Of 60,000 it's withdrawn over 20 000. <pb n="6" xml:id="d44-06" facs="d44-06"/>Of course you paid a certain price
                        because <persName corresp="#p_PCH2">Park Chung-hee</persName> had very high
                        demands. There is also the question of what we discussed last time, the
                        mixed troops of <persName corresp="#p_PCH2">Park Chung-hee</persName> and the
                        U.S. You said last time they were set up to train South Korean troops to
                        engage in combat on their own.</p>
                    <p>A more serious fact is that in 1965 the <persName corresp="#p_PCH2">Park
                            Chung-hee</persName> government had already concluded a treaty with the
                        Japanese Government. The Japanese Government doesn't recognize the
                        sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and therefore it's
                        a great possibility that the Japanese militarists may plan to replace the
                        American troops and officers with the troops and officers of Japan. And
                        according to our information from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
                        there have indeed been officers of self-defense troops in Korea in
                        plainclothes to investigate the work, including engineering work, of the
                        South Korean troops; they have also assisted them. The Japanese militarists
                        take Korea and Taiwan as a springboard for their expansion and this is well
                        known to the world. We are both guarding against Japanese troops replacing
                        U. S. military forces on Taiwan and also the Japanese forces replacing U. S.
                        forces in South Korea. If you are to increase the military strength of the
                        South Korean troops to an even greater extent and more armed conflict should
                        appear after you withdraw, this will greatly affect the relaxation of
                        tensions in the Far East. This is quite similar to what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> said when he visited South Korea. Our
                        Korean friends are most tense about this question and this cannot but affect
                        the Chinese Government and people.</p>
                    <p>In order to save time I would like to read to you the eight points of the
                        Democratic People's Republic of Korea with regard to this matter. (Attached
                        at Tab A is the full text. He reads the first point.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When were the eight
                        points published?</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are transmitting

                        by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. They also made their stand
                        public in another form, and also on some domestic issues including the
                        peaceful reunification of Korea. (He reads the additional seven points.)</p>
                    <p>Because we stand together with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
                        therefore we have the obligation to transmit these eight points to you. The
                        Korean question is one of the questions related to easing tension in the Far
                        East and should not be excluded. It's discussed every year in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and if not solved it will not benefit the
                        easing of this whole situation.</p>
                    <p>Among the powder kegs with regard to the Far East are the following
                        questions: one, Vietnam; two, Taiwan; three, Korea. Comparatively speaking,
                        the question of Taiwan can be considered subsidiary to the other two
                        questions because we are separated by an ocean. <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> also advocates one China and therefore we do
                        not go to Quemoy and Matsu, although we could, and Dulles one time advocated
                        they withdraw from Quemoy and Matsu, but this plan did not materialize and
                        now there is this present situation. Only a big country such as ours could
                        afford to do so. How can you ask the Vietnamese to tolerate such a long
                        split? And how can the Korean people tolerate for a long time a situation of
                        non-unification in their country? And how are they to tolerate a non-equal
                        position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? So if China enters the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, there will be even more issues.
                        (laughter)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I did not think life
                        would be easier when China enters the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I
                        was under no such illusions. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because you are not in favor of
                        China entering the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                        knows our views. We believe in the entering of China into the United
                        Nations, and it's a question of timing for this year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The main issue is whether the
                        tension in the Far East should be relaxed or should be intensified. That's
                        the question. Why is it more easy for us to discuss the Taiwan question?
                        Isn't it strange? Perhaps you don't feel it's strange.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d44-08" facs="d44-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you finished? Let
                        me reply with the frankness with which I always speak to you, Mr. Prime
                        Minister. As the Prime Minister knows, I am personally, the President is
                        personally, dedicated to the betterment of relations between the peoples of
                        the United States and the People's Republic of China and to the easing of
                        tensions in East Asia. At the same time if the easing of tensions is
                        associated with a whole series of demands about what the United States must
                        do then it takes on the character of a series of unilateral
                        propositions.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to discuss in the spirit with which we have discussed the
                        Taiwan problem in order to find a just basis for a long-term relationship.
                        But it's difficult for us to accept pieces of paper or documents in which
                        every other sentence says the United States must, the United States must,
                        the United States must. This is not a basis for anyone to deal with us. Of
                        course, the People's Republic has never done that. I respect the Prime
                        Minister for standing by his friends, and we have expected nothing else. But
                        I would like to repeat what I said yesterday, that it would greatly speed up
                        the solution of outstanding problems if some of China's friends could learn
                        from China some of the largeness of spirit that has governed our
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>We discussed yesterday the problem of Vietnam and unless the Prime Minister
                        has any additional points or questions, I will not return to it. But that is
                        a problem that is on its way to a solution. The only issue is the speed with
                        which it will be achieved.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We were discussing Vietnam only
                        yesterday. We did not mention the matters of Cambodia and Laos. We only
                        touched upon the matter of Cambodia in passing and did not go into the
                        subject, and it's a matter of the sovereignty of Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand but I will
                        leave that aside for the time being unless the Prime Minister wants to
                        discuss these. I will return to Korea, with his agreement. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>We cannot discuss on the basis of a document which says our ally is a puppet
                        government, and other objectionable phrases in this document which I will
                        not enumerate. But let me leave the form and turn to the substance. It's
                        true that I had not thought in detail about the problem of Korea prior <pb n="9" xml:id="d44-09" facs="d44-09"/>to the Prime Minister's
                        conversation with me in July. It is also true that the contacts that have
                        begun have not been uninfluenced by our conversations. But, of course, it is
                        extremely difficult for us to advise our friends to go further towards a
                        government that calls them a puppet. So if the two Koreas are to talk with
                        each other they must do so on a basis of equality.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then the first thing is that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must treat them equally.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your point
                        and that can be an ultimate objective. Let's leave out the word
                        “ultimate.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: For instance, the two Red Cross
                        Societies meeting recently were on an equal basis. Neither called the other
                        a puppet Red Cross Society. That proves there is progress.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was referring to this
                        document.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The wording is easy to revise
                        but that doesn't change the substance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me talk about the
                        substance. Our attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea… I
                        would like to tell the Prime Minister something with which he may not be
                        familiar. We received a communication from them early this year. I don't
                        remember the date. I will let you know. I think it was January. It was
                        through the Romanian Vice President who was travelling in this part of the
                        world. And we returned a very conciliatory reply which has never been
                        answered. We are not complaining about this. We are simply pointing out our
                        attitude is not intrinsically hostile. This is an exchange about which Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> and his colleagues have not been informed.
                        So you were wise to move Korea after all into a restricted session.</p>
                    <p>Let me turn to the substance. I am a great believer in setting an objective
                        first and then working out the details in relationship to that objective. If
                        our objective is a more permanent legal basis for the existing situation in
                        Korea, we are prepared to discuss with you how to bring this about. We are
                        not interested in having a legal basis that <pb n="10" xml:id="d44-10" facs="d44-10"/>makes it possible to reopen hostilities. If your
                        objective is to bring about a reduction of American forces in Korea, I have
                        already told you last time, without making this an international
                        undertaking, this is our policy in any event.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would like to add a word. That
                        is if your ultimate aim is to withdraw U.S. troops in South Korea, is it
                        also your aim to replace them with Japanese troops? It's not so, is it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister is
                        always one step ahead of me. I had a rhetorical flourish for that point.
                        (laughter) It's not our objective to replace with Japanese self-defense
                        forces and indeed the same general principle I mentioned yesterday about
                        sending Japanese self-defense forces to Taiwan would apply to sending them
                        to Korea. The United States is opposed to the military expansion of
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We attach great importance to
                        that statement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In this connection I
                        would like to tell the Prime Minister that after our discussion in July I
                        looked into the problem of Japanese officers visiting Korea, and I regret to
                        say that he was right on some points. I have a list of Japanese officers who
                        have visited Korea this year. And we are keeping an eye on that situation. I
                        was not aware of that when we first met. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>I must also tell the Prime Minister in candor that what we can do depends
                        importantly on where we think we are going. If the objective is to bring
                        about stability on the Korean peninsula, to avert the danger of war, and to
                        lessen the expansion of other powers into that area, then I think Chinese
                        and American interests could be quite parallel. But if the objective is to
                        undermine the existing government in South Korea and make it easier for the
                        North Koreans to attack South Korea or to bring pressure on South Korea,
                        then, of course, a different situation exists. So we have no problem about
                        cooperating with you in bringing about a more permanent legal status for the
                        Korean Peninsula, and while it's a delicate matter on how to do it I believe
                        we can reach an understanding on that point, but you also must keep in mind
                        the concerns that I have expressed.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But since the situation and the
                        atmosphere in the United Nations is such, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> takes such a position of opposition against the Democratic
                        People's Republic of Korea, then the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
                        cannot but think of its own self-defense. And it cannot but be uneasy about
                        the situation in South Korea because South Korea can at any time expand out
                        of its boundaries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I can assure the Prime
                        Minister that while the United States forces are in South Korea we are not
                        cooperating with any attempt by South Korea to cross the existing
                        demarcation line.</p>
                    <p>I will also tell the Prime Minister that we have started a study in our
                        government on the subject of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>. I am
                        not in a position to tell you about it, but we have tried to take into
                        account what we know to be your views. But if you are concerned with the
                        problem of equality I think we can have meaningful discussions. If the
                        attempt is to elaborate a new basis for a legal equality in the opposite
                        direction, then of course it is not possible for us. But we recognize that
                        the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a fact.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Could these three points just
                        now mentioned by you, are they to be affirmed—that is, at a time when U. S.
                        troops are in South Korea, at a time before they have withdrawn or at a time
                        when they are about to withdraw, you will not allow Japanese forces to
                        enter?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The second point is that the
                        United States will finally withdraw their troops from South Korea and before
                        that you will not allow South Korean troops to go across the demarcation
                        line for aggression.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me be precise. Our
                        present plan, which is not public and therefore it will be treated as a
                        confidential communication, our present plan is to withdraw a substantial
                        precentage of our forces from South Korea in the next years. If the tensions
                        in the Far East continue to diminish, the number of forces in Korea can be
                        expected to be very <pb n="12" xml:id="d44-12" facs="d44-12"/>small. But in
                        any event I can assure the Prime Minister that in the conditions that he
                        described and in any other foreseeable conditions we will do our utmost to
                        prevent the expansion of South Korean military forces across the existing
                        lines, and we do not believe it's possible if we oppose it. We do not
                        believe that the United States Treaty with Korea covers the question of
                        South Korean aggression against its neighbors.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The third point is as you just
                        now said, that on the part of the United States it would recognize
                        internationally, including in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the
                        Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a lawful entity on your part, that
                        is, the situation like one that exists in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot continue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a complicated
                        process. We can accept this as an objective but not as an immediate policy,
                        and provided the Republic of Korea is also recognized.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is there a

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is. There clearly
                        is.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: These points were put forward by
                        the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the points handed over to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't like the
                        grammar. And I don't like the adjectives either.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The grammar can be changed. We
                        can do that. The translators can do it for you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How about adjectives
                        like “puppet government?”</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I think that can be changed.
                        They don't call each other the puppet Red Cross Society.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the question
                        the Prime Minister is asking me about these 8 points? <pb n="13" xml:id="d44-13" facs="d44-13"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We are telling you of the stand
                        of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The stand is not the nature of
                        adjectives or grammar. You can see from it that their stand is that they
                        desire lawful status in the international arena. And because they do not
                        have such a legal status they are, of course, indignant and such a feeling
                        is bound to be in the wording.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Leaving aside the 8
                        points, some of which are irrelevant to the problem—I don't believe we have
                        to discuss with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the problems of
                        Taiwan and Indochina or if we deal with the three points the Prime Minister
                        puts forward, I believe that the United States and the People's Republic of
                        China can pursue a parallel course. We would like a recognized peaceful
                        status in the Korean peninsula. We will not support the expansion of
                        Japanese military forces into Korea. We will not support Japanese expansion
                        there or anywhere else. We will not support South Korean expansionism. We
                        believe that if the two states now existing in Korea are prepared to deal
                        with each other on an equal basis peace can be brought to the Korean
                        Peninsula and that is why we encouraged the contacts of the Red Cross after
                        my conversation with you.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I do not like to use the term
                        “the two states in Korea,” because that would be equal to saying that Korea
                        will be permanently divided into two, regardless whether the Korean people
                        should wish for unification and should be able to do so peacefully.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: One objection is the <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have told the Prime
                        Minister we are studying this program, and I will give him some tentative
                        conclusions through our channel before the President's visit, or at the
                        latest when the President is here. We recognize this problem, and I will be
                        a bad negotiator and admit that there is merit in the criticism in what has
                        been said to us. <pb n="14" xml:id="d44-14" facs="d44-14"/>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The second question is why
                        should the Democratic People's Republic of Korea be blocked from attending
                        the meetings of that commission by conditions attached to the
                        invitation?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is part of the
                        general problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because if the Korean question
                        is to be discussed, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be
                        allowed, as one party in the matter, to attend without conditions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As to how the final peaceful
                        unification of the Korean issue should be finally reached we have not
                        studied further, but it should be unified because it is a peninsula of only
                        40 million people. This issue has remained there for 17 years now. Of
                        course, we need some time to find a way out.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we can agree on the
                        objective as we described, then I believe the point the Prime Minister
                        raised about participation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in
                            <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> has a great deal of merit.</p>
                    <p>(The <persName>Jenkins</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> meeting is reported to have broken up and Jenkins
                        relays the message that it was his understanding that they should join Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the Prime Minister.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> says he would like it,
                        if the Prime Minister agrees. The Prime Minister says that is fine, but that
                        he would like first to finish this part of the discussion.)</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Our stand is that it's not for
                        the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to be a member of the
                        Commission—that is impossible because they are not a member of the United
                        Nations—but that <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> should be
                        abolished.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are looking into
                        that question.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: On the other hand our stand is
                        that when the question of Korea is discussed in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> they should have the right to participate. We think the
                        position is reasonable. But if we were in their place, that is if it were in
                        regard to China, we should not have such a request. But we are not them.
                        They are a peninsula, and China is a big country, and we can do without the
                        United Nations if it doesn't come for us. So on this matter we can take two
                        different positions, but because we are their friend we should represent
                        their view on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How does the Prime

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The time is not right.
                        Are you content to leave the issue at this exchange or would you like a

                        is an issue and opinions should be exchanged.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do I understand that on
                        general objectives there is some agreement even though we differ about
                        specific methods?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Not only the specific methods,
                        but we haven't gone into the whole of the problem, for instance, how to help
                        to bring about the peaceful reunification of Korea. We haven't exchanged
                        methods on that either. What we are agreed on is only that ultimately the
                        United States' forces should be withdrawn from South Korea. As for when that
                        should be done, that is your question and also a question worth an exchange
                        of views between our two sides.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's only the Korean people that
                        have the right to reunify their country, and neither party can call itself
                        the representative of the whole Korean people. The immediate question is
                        that the United States has no intention to let the Japanese self-defense
                        troops replace it in South Korea. That's wha you just now said.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the context of all
                        other statements that is quite correct. But if military pressure should
                        start from the north, then one cannot be sure of the consequences.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean if the north attacks
                        the south?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If that should occur, it will be
                        prepared to undertake even greater burdens.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The north?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The north. Of course, we will
                        not make provocations for foreign forces, but we must also be prepared for
                        outside forces to attack us from all directions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Under the conditions we
                        described, if the north does not plan to expand into the south, and the
                        south does not plan to expand into the north, which we believe, then we will
                        oppose the movement of Japanese self-defense forces into Korea.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: All these issues are mutual.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There is only one point we did
                        not discuss. That is how the peaceful reunification of Korea will be brought
                        about. We can discuss this later.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have no concrete
                        idea now.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It has been delayed for 18
                        years. The Vietnam issue was delayed for 17 years. But the Chinese question
                        was delayed for 22 years, and it didn't matter, but our two countries should
                        sympathize with the two smaller countries. Don't you think so?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I think we should
                        both use our influence with our friends to keep them from military
                        adventures.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Didn't you propose the meetings
                        of the Red Cross Societies? Maybe that is a good way. But now they are also
                        being dragged out with no conclusion. So the era of negotiations can also be
                        an era of dragging out things.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Except between us.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That should not be any more. If
                        they continue to drag on, they will not be solved.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's not our
                        position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But we tolerate your dragging
                        out, because you have not taken action in Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have taken some
                        action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We can tolerate that, but other
                        nations wouldn't. Can you find others? I don't think so. Including the
                        states of Latin America.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The states of Latin
                        America are not known for their patience. Mr. Prime Minister, I think you
                        have approached the problem of our relationship with great wisdom and I have
                        said so often in the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The great wisdom is represented
                        by Chairman Mao-Tsetung and it is a summary of his experience in past
                        struggles. He doesn't agree that this is foresight.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It has also not been
                        easy for us. It has also been a major change in our policy, and the Prime
                        Minister pointed that out to Mr. Reston—to his displeasure.</p>

                        there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Before Mr.

                        If the vote for Secretary General should come up before you have joined the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and if there is a candidate who is
                        objectionable to you and you let us know, we will take it very seriously
                        into account.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have not studied that
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no need to
                        reply now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have absolutely no knowledge
                        of such things, to speak honestly. There have been a number of countries who
                        are telling us whom they will propose for the Secretary General.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know the candidates,
                        but I didn't know if there were some to whom you violently objected.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It wouldn't do to let Sygman

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No South Korean. That
                        is what I learned in the previous session.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Or South Vietnamese. I don't
                        think it would be all right for you to put it forward either because if you
                        put it forward it would be impossible for you to continue your negotiations.
                        Similarly, it would be bad for you to put forward Sirik Matak.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But among the serious
                        candidates, like the man from Finland and the man from Ceylon. Perhaps the
                        Prime Minister wants to think about this or not respond at all.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Anyway, I should say that it
                        would be very unseemly to nominate anyone from South Korea, Cambodia, or
                        South Vietnam. I do not think it would be suitable to nominate a Japanese

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: A very complicated

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One has to be very

                        Japan. What are your views on Japan now?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why doesn't the Prime
                        Minister, who has thought so much about the problem, begin with his concerns
                        and perhaps I should respond to him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: At the present level of the
                        economic development of Japan, it is difficult for her to put brakes on
                        that. And so inevitably that gives rise to contradictions overseas, like
                        some large groups of developed and also developing countries. For instance,
                        there was a question of a big country when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> announced the new economic policy
                        that affected the economic development of Japan. On this it appears you <pb n="20" xml:id="d44-20" facs="d44-20"/>are finding a way to solve these
                        problems, but nevertheless they exist and are increasing. That's one aspect
                        of the question.</p>
                    <p>Also, there is the question of contradictions with the developing countries.
                        And so the question arises as to whether the help to developing countries
                        will help them or on the contrary, deepen their colonization of these
                        countries. According to the press, present Japanese policy is to deepen
                        their colonization of these countries. And then there is another aspect of
                        this question. That is another big power wonders whether to bring in
                        Japanese investors to help bring in raw material and help it develop some of
                        its markets.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You mean your northern
                        neighbor?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. And so the
                        negotiations are continuing with them, and so the future of Japan is in
                        flux. As for us, we always hope that Japan, which has come through two World
                        Wars and particularly after the lessons of the Second World War, would take
                        the road of peace and neutrality. But that is merely our hope, and it is
                        probably the hope of a substantial number of the Japanese people.</p>
                    <p>But if the Japanese government continues its policy of capitalistic
                        competition, it is bound sooner or later to give rise to trouble. Because if
                        one wants to develop, one should allow others to develop. So if their
                        present policies in economic development are not changed, then the economic
                        expansion will bring military expansion even if they use the name of
                        self-defense. You are an expert in this field and also your colleague, Mr.
                        Reischauer, saw this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Although he is very

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's not necessarily the case.
                        It depends on how one interprets friendship. If the purpose is to provoke a
                        Third World War, then it is development in another direction. But if the aim
                        is to relax <pb n="21" xml:id="d44-21" facs="d44-21"/>the tension in the Far
                        East, then we should consider the issue of Japan. After the conclusion of
                        the Second World War, although Japan had committed aggression against China
                        for over 50 years, we have not adopted a policy of revenge. On the contrary,
                        we adopted a policy of peace and friendship towards Japan, but for that one
                        must have mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity,
                        nonaggression, non-interference, equality, and mutual benefit and peaceful
                        coexistence. Even so can there be peace and friendship between our two
                        countries. And this view is held among the broad masses of Japanese people
                        as well as the politicians of Japan.</p>
                    <p>But the Japanese authorities are often encouraged by some other quarters to
                        be more aggressive. That is because Japan was benefitted after the Second
                        World War. It did not have to pay compensation, and it made war profits off
                        of wars in other lands. And during the past 25 years and more it need not
                        spend much on its own national defense.</p>
                    <p>The situation now is different. Its feathers have grown on its wings and it
                        is about to take off. So with the development of the economy it is bound to
                        spend more for defense in its Fourth Defense Plan, which I mentioned to you
                        the last time. Once Japan does take the road of military expansion, it is
                        hard to say now to what degree it will develop.</p>
                    <p>And so if we want to relax tension in the Far East we should explain views
                        frankly on this question. We do not want to be hostile with Japan. We want
                        peace and friendship. We are not without ground in saying this. Because not
                        only China is not the China of the 30s or 40s; nor is Japan the Japan of the
                        30s or 40s, and great changes have taken place among the Japanese people. So
                        if in dealing with this matter, if the expansionist policies of the Japanese
                        government can be repudiated and a policy of peace encouraged, then this
                        state of affairs can be improved. As for their own problems, their ultimate
                        settlement must be brought about by them.</p>

                        recognizing the Taiwan authorities but recognizing only the People's
                        Republic of China; of giving up all ambitions against Taiwan and Korea as
                        two wings of outward expansion; <pb n="22" xml:id="d44-22" facs="d44-22"/>and respecting the independence and territorial integrity of the People's
                        Republic of China. We are very clear about history. It is very interesting
                        when we look at those politicians and statesmen who have come here that were
                        former foreign ministers and prime ministers.</p>

                        regard to Japan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, I
                        will give you our frank assessment. There is not a total unanimity of view
                        in our government, but let me give you the White House view which over a
                        period of time tends to dominate. If I can begin, according to my habit,
                        with a philosophical point. If I can contrast China with Japan as a society,
                        China by tradition has a universal outlook but Japan has had a tribal
                        outlook.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They are more narrow. It is also
                        quite strange. They are an island mass. Britain too is an island mass.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are different
                        because Japan believes that their society is so different that they can
                        adjust to anything and preserve their national essence. Therefore, the
                        Japanese are capable of sudden and explosive changes. They went from
                        feudalism to emperor worship in two to three years. They went from emperor
                        worship to democracy in three months.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It depends on how they
                        assess the balance of power in the world.</p>

                        had a nervous breakdown afterwards. Very complicated. Not a very profound
                        conversation, Mr. Prime Minister. I am not revealing any secrets when I tell
                        you that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Japanese have no
                        sensibility for the attitudes of other people because of this cultural
                        concentration on themselves. I say this because this peculiarity of Japan
                        imposes special responsibilities on all who have to deal with them. You as
                        well as us. I believe, and I have always believed, that those Americans who
                        thought that it was possible to keep building up Japan and then they would
                        pursue a policy we preferred with greater resources were extremely
                        naive.</p>
                    <p>I agree with the Prime Minister that economic development produces its own
                        imperatives. And I agree in part with the Prime Minister that the Japanese
                        method of economic development illustrates its tribal character because its
                        method has the objective of tying countries to its policy. So I have no
                        illusions about Japan.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I believe also that those countries which believe from
                        another perspective that they can tie Japan to their policy by opposite
                        methods will suffer the same disillusionment. For example—before I get to
                        this—I think there is in the present situation a great temptation for
                        everyone, especially for the People's Republic and also for the Soviet
                        Union. Japan has been made uncertain in its orientation by our meeting in
                        July. Therefore, I have noticed that the Soviet Union has made a special
                        effort to try to move it in its direction. And the objective consequence of
                            <pb n="24" xml:id="d44-24" facs="d44-24"/>some of the moves of the
                        People's Republic could be to attempt to move Japan in its direction. For
                        example, The People's Daily, in an editorial of September 18, warned Japan
                        that the United States could betray her at any moment. It is my frank
                        opinion that such competition can only encourage Japan's nationalism. On the
                        one hand, it will give an impetus to the forces that have supported the old
                        policy, but in the long term it will lead to a Japan that attempts to play a
                        balance of power politics in the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>It is from this point of view that I would like to comment about the Prime
                        Minister's statement that he would like to see neutrality for Japan. It is
                        hard to know what neutrality for the third largest industrialized nation,
                        with 120 million people, can mean. In history there have been only two kinds
                        of neutrality: those who have been guaranteed by other countries like
                        Belgium, or those who declared themselves neutral and protected themselves
                        with their own strength, like Switzerland and Sweden. It is those countries
                        which declare themselves neutral and protect themselves by their own
                        military strength that always have large armies. Switzerland and Sweden have
                        larger military forces for their size than any other country in Europe.</p>
                    <p>A Japan which defends itself with its own resources will be an objective
                        danger to all countries around it because it will be so much more powerful.
                        Therefore, I believe that its present relationship with the U.S. is actually
                        a restraint on Japan. If we wanted to pursue a cynical policy, we would cut
                        Japan loose and encourage it to stand on its own feet, because this would
                        cause so much tension between Japan and China, and we could come between
                        them. That would be very shortsighted. Either you or we would be the
                        victim.</p>
                    <p>So it is important that we understand each other about Japan, and that we
                        both show restraint vis-a-vis Japan. Those Americans who believe that Japan
                        can be an obedient extension of American policy in the Pacific are naive.
                        The Japanese have their own objectives, and they are made in Tokyo and not
                        Washington. It is an illusion made by people for whom history started in
                        1945 who say it is the other way. But also it is dangerous for others to try
                        to use Japan against the United States, because both these policies have a
                        tendency to exalt Japan.</p>
                    <p>So let me repeat to you concretely what I have already said in other contexts
                        about American policy. First, we are opposed to the nuclear <pb n="25" xml:id="d44-25" facs="d44-25"/>rearmament of Japan, no matter what may
                        be said by officials who have no authority to say these things. Besides,
                        they have since maintained they have never said it.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we are in favor of keeping the conventional rearmament of Japan to
                        limits which are adequate for the defense of the four Japanese islands and
                        for nothing else.</p>
                    <p>We will oppose the extension of Japanese military power to Taiwan, Korea, or
                        elsewhere as I have pointed out to you in other meetings.</p>
                    <p>And we recognize that the problem of the economic development of Japan is one
                        that concerns the whole world at this moment and not only Japan itself.</p>
                    <p>Those are our national principles, but to be effective I can only repeat that
                        they require a restraint on all sides.</p>

                        nuclear armed Japan, does that mean you would give Japan a nuclear

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They can? How?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because they will feel they have
                        as their allies a big power so that they can expand economically with their
                        military forces following.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is very difficult to
                        talk about hypothetical situations, but in any military conflict which would
                        be produced by an attempt by Japan to extend, I doubt very seriously that
                        the nuclear umbrella would apply. The nuclear umbrella applies primarily to
                        a nuclear attack on the Japanese islands. It stands to reason we are no more
                        likely to use nuclear weapons for Japan than we are for ourselves; in fact,
                        less likely. But the Japanese have the ability to produce nuclear weapons
                        very quickly.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's possible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we were to withdraw,
                        their peaceful nuclear energy program gives them enough plutonium so they
                        could easily build nuclear weapons. So the alternative is really a Japanese
                        nuclear program which would be very much less desirable, and which we
                        oppose.</p>

                        limiting the Japanese self-defense strength?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, I
                        do not want to assert things of which I am not sure. The tendencies that he
                        describes do exist in Japan. I believe that in our present relationship we
                        have a better opportunity to limit the self-defense forces of Japan than if
                        it can be claimed that Japan has been betrayed and therefore the nationalism
                        reasserts itself. It makes no sense for the United States to have fought
                        World War II to prevent the physical domination of Asia by Japan in order to
                        encourage it 25 years later. It is my personal belief, because we have not
                        addressed this question as a government, that as the Prime Minister
                        suggests, if Japan should have a massive rearmament program, then the
                        traditional relationship between China and the United States would reassert
                        itself, and we would like to discuss very seriously the situation that would
                        exist.</p>
                    <p>So to sum up, we will do our best to limit armament to defend the four
                        islands, but failing that, we will do what we can with other countries to
                        stop the physical expansion of Japan.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I could not quite understand
                        this point, because at the present time another big power is trying to win
                        over Japan and enable Japan's economy to have a bigger military. Therefore,
                        why is it not good to put forward to the Japanese people that they should
                        follow peace and neutrality?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Obviously, I do not
                        mind Japan following a policy of peace. I believe that the objective result
                        of what Japan will call neutrality will be heavily armed; it will be
                        technically neutral but so was Japan before. Besides, that other power
                        specializes in the shortsighted and hasn't brought off a big project in a
                        long time. What have they to offer except petty irritation of their
                        neighbors and of us?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, that power economically
                        speaking may be able to satisfy some of the appetites of the Japanese, but
                        not very big.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't think so.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Couldn't she even satisfy some
                        of Japan's desires?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I frankly would doubt
                        it. I think when they confront some of the Japanese economic methods they
                        will pull back.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Maybe you know more about this
                        than I do.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: First of all, Japan
                        would have to reorient its whole economic structure in order to do this on a
                        large scale. And it would be extremely dangerous for the Soviet Union to
                        whet Japan's appetites for Siberia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's true. That's what I mean.
                        They would whet their appetite and that would take some time and also must
                        risk something. And so the Japanese monopoly capitalists must consider
                        something different.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Both sides will
                        play with it, but neither will be able to reorient themselves this
                        completely, in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. Probably during a
                        certain period of time, if the Soviet Union continues in this way, it will
                        lose more. So under those circumstances why is it not good to encourage
                        Japan to follow the plan of peace and neutrality? Because it shows no
                        revenge, and every time we test nuclear missiles we say they will not be
                        used for war, and so there is no reason for them to develop their appetites
                        in this direction. I understand what you mean. Japan is a wild house without
                        U.S. control, here, there and everywhere. Is it possible to control them
                        with her economy to such an extent?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not completely, but in
                        military aspects, which concern you, there is more possibility than under
                        your arrangements. As for the nuclear umbrella, we don't have to have a
                        treaty with Japan to extend it. If we want to defend Japan in case of attack
                        we can do it. In the nuclear age a country defends another not because of a
                        treaty but because its national interest is at stake. So we don't need the
                        treaty for ourselves. Japan is not doing much for us militarily. If we had
                        aggressive designs in the Far East, we wouldn't need Japan. We wouldn't need
                        our bases in Japan. We can do it elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Secretary Laird said he
                        never made such statements, and he wouldn't tell a lie. (laughter) After my

                        Japan you have your view and we have ours. Let us see how it develops.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we have certain
                        parallel interests in Japan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, it would not be good to
                        have a revival of Japanese militarism, but there is the question of Japan
                        developing its economy to its present level. We cannot say that you haven't
                        fattened Japan to its present extent.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is essentially true.
                        But now it's there, we must decide what to do about it on both sides of the
                        Pacific. We cannot be fatuous optimists, and you also must look at the
                        situation in the context of the present.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Japan had already been fed into
                        such a fattened state and that was particularly emphasized by your
                        President's speech on the 6th of July. That was a most realistic statement.
                        The question now is that the broad masses of Japanese people demand the
                        disbandment of bases on Japan. What do you think will be the role of these
                        bases in Japan, including Okinawa?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Whenever the Japanese
                        really want us to withdraw our forces from Japan, we will withdraw them. We
                        are not doing this for ourselves primarily. But I don't think you should
                        rejoice when that day happens, because some day you will regret it just as
                        we today regret how we built up Japan economically.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is two different matters.
                        Because in withdrawing your forces that can only be done under an attitude
                        of friendship to Japan and not hostility.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You know you do not approve of
                        the Soviet Union sending its forces into Czechoslovakia so how can you place
                        forces on fcreign soil?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We did not send our
                        forces into Japan. If the Japan government asks us to withdraw, we will of
                        course do it. If Japan asks us to abrogate the defense treaty, then within
                        one year we will withdraw them. They will not stay longer than they want.
                        Japanese forces have nothing to do with America, but Soviet troops in
                        Czechoslovakia are there to impose a government on the people of
                        Czechoslovakia. So there is a complete difference.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Pakistan accepted, but it is not
                        the method of the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union is threatening
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have not seen the
                        text of the letter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We just learned about this
                        recently. What is your estimate? You said on your arrival you thought there
                        was danger.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My estimate is that at
                        first the flood of refugees caused a problem for India. They had a
                        reasonable complaint at the beginning that the flood of refugees would upset
                        the balance in Bengal. Since then, and we have responded by making
                        available—over half of all assistance given to the refugees in India comes
                        from the United States—we have given nearly $300 million for the
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: How much did the Soviet Union?
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Much less. Less than
                        $100 million. Maybe $50 - 60 million is my recollection. It's much less.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I read the book by Maxwell that the Prime Minister
                        recommended to me last time, and it is our view, certainly at the White
                        House, that the Indians are applying essentially the same tactics to that
                        situation as they did to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is their tradition.</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="d44-31" facs="d44-31"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is our judgment that
                        the Indians see in this situation no longer a legal problem of East Pakistan
                        but an opportunity to settle the whole problem of Pakistan which they have
                        never accepted. Their strategy in doing this is to force so abrupt a change
                        in the situation in East Pakistan, and by such methods, that it will weaken
                        the fabric of West Pakistan. And they are encouraged in this tendency by
                        what they believe to be the support of some outside countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Quite a big encouragement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As far as the policy of
                        the United States is concerned, we are the only major western country that
                        has not condemned Pakistan. It is only because of us, and I may say over the
                        opposition of the pro-Indian element of our government, that the consortium
                        hasn't cut off aid to Pakistan. And we will bring about now a $90 million
                        debt relief for Pakistan. And we have in the form of relief made available
                        $250 million of other funds.</p>
                    <p>We are totally opposed to Indian military action against Pakistan. I do not
                        normally see ambassadors, but I have warned the Indian ambassador on behalf
                        of the President that if there was an attack by India we will cut off all
                        economic aid to India. We have told the Russians of our view, and they have
                        told us they are trying to restrain the situation, but I am not sure that I
                        believe them. We believe that there is a good chance that India will either
                        attack or provoke the Pakistanis to attack by driving the Pakistanis into a
                        desperate action in the next month or two. We told President Yahya that I
                        would discuss this with you when I was here, and I simply want you to know
                        we are totally opposed to it, and we are ready to listen to any proposal you
                        will like to make.</p>
                    <p>We have urged President Yahya to withdraw his forces some distance from the
                        borders and also to make some political offer in order to overcome the
                        propaganda that is so systematically made against her and in order to
                        support herein the United Nations and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is supposed to come to the
                        United States November 4 and 5, and if she comes and if there is no war by
                        then, the President will speak to her in the strongest possible terms. We
                        would be very grateful for your views.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will like to make a further
                        study of this matter before telling you. Because we hadn't known until quite
                        recently this letter from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to
                        President Yahya which has the nature of an ultimatum.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Really?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I have not studied it because I
                        just learned it some time ago. When Marshal Tito went to India he went as a
                        mediator, but he was persuaded by Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I saw that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As Madame Gandhi had already
                        visited Moscow and also this visit by Tito, it may further add to her
                        miscalculations. So maybe we can discuss tomorrow or the day after.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It will be helpful to
                        determine our actions also.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We from the East and you from
                        the West have the most to do with East Pakistan, and we understand best the
                        traditions of India. After having read the book by Maxwell you also believe
                        it is the traditional policy of India—she doesn't agree the Kashmir problem
                        is solved and doesn't believe in the existence of Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We believe she will try
                        to destroy East Pakistan. We have no national interest in East Pakistan. We
                        want it to reflect the will of the people. We have no interest whether it
                        stays with Pakistan or not. We have made many proposals to India by which we
                        will separate the problem of refugees from the political evolution of East
                        Pakistan and which will not prejudge the situation. But India has kept
                        making demands which they know President Yahya will not accept and which
                        would force a solution in so short a time frame that it will have the effect
                        of destroying the structure of West Pakistan also. That's the nature of the
                        present problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And to add to that the desire of
                        the Soviet Union to exploit the situation and contradictions in Asia, so as
                        to give it a free hand in Europe. This is a very stupid way of thinking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Gratitude is not the
                        outstanding quality of India, as Moscow will learn. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's so because the Soviet
                        policies have not been to really help the people gain national independence.
                        Let's go to the Soviet Union. I would like to hear your views.</p>
                    <pb n="33" xml:id="d44-33" facs="d44-33"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: With respect to the
                        Soviet Union, we have, of course, kept you scrupulously informed about all
                        our activities. As you know, we had talked to the Soviet Union about a
                        summit before my visit to Peking. And as I told you then, when certain
                        conditions were met we would accept it. But I have kept you informed about
                        those activities and those moves, the various attempts to see if we will go
                        to Moscow first.</p>
                    <p>I must say the visit to Peking has not changed the direction of Soviet
                        policy, but it has changed their manners somewhat. We have a number of
                        concrete issues with the Soviet Union: the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
                        and various issues in Europe such as Berlin which has been settled. At the
                        moment the Soviet Union is pressing very hard for our agreement to a
                        European Security Conference.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In the final days of the
                        negotiations on the West Berlin question the Soviet Union gave up very
                        rapidly all the things they insisted on in the past. The concessions they
                        made were bigger than those you estimated to us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Estimated when?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Last summer. On the 16th of
                        August you estimated that it would be probably the purely technical problems
                        that would be settled on Berlin. But even before the settlement of these
                        purely technical questions Kosygin went personally to Berlin and the result
                        was a complete collapse. It went very quickly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I meant to convey that
                        the settlement was on the access procedures and matters of this kind. This
                        is what is agreed to. I am not familiar with any other concessions. What
                        other concessions does the Prime Minister think the Soviet Union made?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's purely technical. That is
                        the word you used. By their concession it was equivalent to their
                        recognizing West Berlin as part of West Germany, which they haven't before.
                        And they embarrassed East Germany; they will say they were excessive in
                        giving promises to West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is true that the
                        agreement was better from our point of view than we thought six months ago.
                        But the basic reason in our judgment is that the Soviet Union has a great
                        desire to free itself in Europe so it can concentrate on other areas.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Is it possible for them to free
                        themselves?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a dilemma for the
                        Soviet policy. They can settle the issue they have with us because we accept
                        settlements when they are consistent with what we have always claimed. On
                        the other hand, when tensions ease with the United States and with Western
                        Europe the freedom of movement within Eastern Europe increases. That's the
                        contradiction of the present situation. Now we recognize that when we make a
                        settlement with the Soviet Union, say on Berlin, that this can have the
                        objective consequence of increasing your problems.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That does not matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we do not do it for
                        this reason.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we keep you
                        scrupulously informed. I probably should have given you the details of the
                        Berlin Agreement before it was made, but your representative gets so much
                        from me I don't want to strain his telegraphic abilities too much.</p>
                    <p>On the European Security Conference, the Soviet… we believe that the Soviet
                        Union wants this to solve the contradictions in its Eastern European policy.
                        When two sides meet each other as blocs, it can increase its hold on Eastern
                        Europe and add to peace and the relaxation of tensions. When Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> spoke to the
                        President this was one of his chief topics of conversation, to get his
                        support for a European Security Conference. We told him that we could not
                        consider it until the Berlin negotiations were concluded.</p>
                    <p>And he also indicated a strong interest in a solution of the Middle East
                        problem. And finally …</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I will ask a question about the
                        European Security Conference. Your idea is that independent states will take
                        part or as blocs?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We want it as states.
                        The Soviet Union prefers them to participate in blocs. We want a precise
                        agenda. The Soviet Union has not yet put forward an agenda. In fact, we
                        don't really know what the agenda <pb n="35" xml:id="d44-35" facs="d44-35"/>could be. I think it's what the Prime Minister would call subsidiary
                        questions, cultural exchange and trade. (laughter) We are using the
                        formulations I am learning from the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is not our formulations. It
                        is a question of our concern.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand that.
                        Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated a great
                        interest in expanding American-Soviet trade without being specific, and we
                        are sending our Secretary of Commerce there to see what they have in mind.
                        We have not seen their proposal.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: What is the possibility for
                        solving the Middle East problem? You said you are not taking part directly
                        in these matters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the Middle East?
                        That's why it's not being solved. (laughter) It's being pursued at this
                        moment with more energy than precision. (laughter) The trouble in the Middle
                        East . … normally one says that a good settlement is one with which both
                        parties are satisfied, but in the Middle East it is better to have a
                        settlement where both parties are dissatisfied. There are some attempts at
                        the moment to get secret talks started between the Egyptians and Israelis.
                        The degree of their secrecy is shown by the fact I read about it in a
                        newspaper today. We will know in about six weeks if there's any progress. If
                        there should be any serious prospects I will let you know what they are. At
                        this moment my own estimate is that it will fail.</p>
                    <p>Then Gromyko asked me to have tea with him alone while he was there. This is
                        not known by anybody. He repeated all of the other things that I already
                        told you and what he had already said to the President, but of no greater
                        consequence. But he did also discuss U.S. relations with China. He said the
                        Soviet Union would not object to improving our relations, but it would
                        object to our colluding with China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He used English directly with
                        you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: English. We were alone
                        with his Ambassador. I asked him what he meant by collusion, and if he could
                        give me any concrete examples of what we might do to which he objected, but
                        he only used vague formulations such as whatever threatens peace, and they
                        would know it, but he didn't tell me. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>As for our own policies, I repeat the only way we can deal with you is on the
                        basis of honor and therefore we will keep you informed about <pb n="36" xml:id="d44-36" facs="d44-36"/>anything we discuss with the Soviet Union
                        that might affect you. And since undoubtedly there will be certain figures
                        that will attempt to make difficulties, you can assume whatever you hear
                        from other sources on what is going on is not true.</p>
                    <p>We have refused in every agreement we have made with the Soviet Union, such
                        as on accidental war, we have refused a clause that would make it applicable
                        to other countries also. And in the negotiations on <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> we have refused a clause which would entitle each country
                        to attack against any country that is planning provocative attacks. We have
                        to rely on you to maintain the confidence of all this information.</p>
                    <p>As I told you last time, we are prepared to make with you any agreement in
                        the field of arms control which we are also making with the Soviet Union. We
                        understand that you will not participate in any agreement that has the
                        consequence of,what you say, is lassoing you. But, for example, the
                        agreement on accidental war involves no restriction on your military
                        operations. It merely provides an opportunity for each side to inform the
                        other about unexplained events. We are not urging it, but we are prepared to
                        have the same agreement with you. We are not making it as a formal proposal
                        but just want you to know we are prepared to do it.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's an agreement on the
                        prevention of accidental war.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's correct, or on a
                        direct communication link, if you are interested. Those are the two we have
                        recently signed with the Soviet Union. If you want to read it, you can read
                        copies I have of the two agreements. I repeat, this is not a formal
                        presentation, but just to familiarize you with it. This is all I wanted to
                        say about the Soviet relationships.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They didn't at all mention our
                        boundary negotiations with them? Did they mention anything about the
                        territorial claims?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They made a very
                        oblique reference to it. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs)
                        But only that you make exorbitant claims. I refused to discuss it with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I thank Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for telling us about the United
                        States-Soviet relations. So long as an agreement is beneficial to the
                        relaxation of tension and concluded on a basis of equality and beneficial to
                        the people of the world, <pb n="37" xml:id="d44-37" facs="d44-37"/>we think
                        it is a correct agreement. If it is not beneficial, we will express our view
                        on that.</p>
                    <p>The Berlin question has no direct relation to us. I would just like to ask a
                        question. How was it that after the four powers had reached an agreement,
                        that there was a squabble between the East and West with translation?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is a peculiarity
                        of dealing with the Soviet Union. As I expressed last time, in dealing with
                        the Soviet Union as soon as an agreement was reached, there would be another
                        negotiation on the wording of the agreement. That is why I asked you when we
                        were here in July if you would publish the same text. There were really two
                        squabbles. One was -the agreement was made in English; the official language
                        was English. When it was translated into Russian, the Russians took the
                        words that were settled in English and put them back into the original
                        form.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then they translated that
                        into German.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, that was settled,
                        and the Russians accepted once more what they had already agreed to. Then
                        their German allies started the same thing again when the Russian text was
                        translated into German. By that point we needed a theologian to negotiate
                        it. So all of the German disputes were settled except for two words. For
                        those two words they didn't use German. They put down the English, French
                        and Russian. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is not an important matter to
                        try to get something from tac- tical maneuvers. It is a waste of time. Maybe
                        they have a reason.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But they lose so much
                        good will in the process, it's not worth it. You cannot obtain real gains by
                        tricky maneuvers.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The two agreements Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> just mentioned with the Soviet
                        Union are on accidental war and the hotline; but that does not arise for us
                        because we are now in an experimental stage, and we have already said we
                        will not be first to use these weapons. And we have already replied to the
                        Soviet Union on attending a meeting on their proposal (five nuclear
                        powers).</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We notified them
                        also.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is a thing of the past. On
                        those two questions there is no necessity for us, but if you would like to
                        give us the text we will use it as a reference because we know nothing about
                        this. Thank you for increasing our knowledge in this field.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union made a proposal in the United Nations about convening a
                        world disarmament conference. They have just raised it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They have raised it at
                        the United Nations but not as a formal proposal to which we have had to
                        reply.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Did that proposal include all
                        countries, whether or not they are members of the United Nations?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's my impression too. It
                        would involve countries like ourselves who are not members of the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your attitude
                        toward that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I want to ask Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s view because you know about
                        this but perhaps you have not studied it either. Maybe it is an attempt to
                        reply to our statement that if it's for nuclear disarmament it should be
                        with all countries of the world, no matter what their size, and they are
                        answering us with plans for a general disarmament conference. Maybe I am not
                        accurate because I have not studied it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is one they have
                        made before. Khrushchev made it every year. When it is approached
                        concretely, it is very difficult to negotiate because how can one compare
                        the military requirements in very different situations and with very
                        different neighbors. And so our view is that it is not a very meaningful
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. Proceeding from
                        that standpoint it is like firing empty cannon. It is even more unrealistic
                        than firing empty cannon. It is fired by one side, and the other side need
                        pay no attention to it. But in convening such a conference they will waste
                        the time and energies of all countries. Armaments are being added daily so
                        how can there be disarmament?</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="d44-39" facs="d44-39"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will try to deflect
                        the discussions into a specific regional basis so you have a standard of
                        comparison and not on a global basis.</p>

                        you mentioned a draft communique for your President's visit, an outline. If
                        the visit is to take place starting from the 21st of February, that will be
                        four months afterwards. I understand it is not an easy thing to work up a
                        communique four months ahead of schedule. I don't know if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has a draft in mind.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we can agree on
                        certain principles that are not likely to change in the next 3-4 months. On
                        specific subjects like Vietnam, much will depend on the situation at that
                        time and it will have to wait until the visit. But if we wait until the
                        visit, we will be so much involved in the consciousness of the need to draft
                        a communique, and so many people will be involved in drafting a communique,
                        that it will be difficult to do the best of what we are capable. And, of
                        course, whatever we do would be confined on our side to the President and
                        would not be generally circulated so it would be possible to change it in
                        the interval and during the visit.</p>

                        preliminary outline of what you have in mind so we can have it for our

                        this visit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It will probably not be
                        easier when the President is here, when we are all busy with extraneous
                        activities.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. It should be
                        considered very preliminary and very one-sided because it is what we put
                        together without any consultation with you.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have tried to take
                        into account some points you raised with me in July and also on this trip. I
                        have omitted specific topics such as Korea and Vietnam, but I have some
                        ideas of what we can say if we reach that point. If you would like two
                        copies, I have two copies. (He hands over the first U.S. draft at Tab

                        have two more days. We will need still another plenary meeting with the
                        other friends present and also one or two restricted meetings. There is
                        nothing else for tonight. If you want to see a film, you can. Otherwise, a

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe we could see the

                    <p>The President is now very concerned that you not arrive in Washington on
                        Monday night. He wishes to be sure that you plan your return trip to arrive
                        some time after Noon on Tuesday. I told him that this might be quite
                        difficult for you to arrange since you did not control your own destiny at
                        that end. He replied that in any event he wanted you to be aware of his
                        wishes on this matter, and posed two options:</p>
                    <p>1. Either remain in Peking if you consider this appropriate so as to arrive
                        in Washington not before Noon on Tuesday, or</p>
                    <p>2. Follow original schedule and remain overnight in Anchorage, departing at
                        such a time that you will not arrive at Andrews before Noon and preferably
                        later on Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>I was told not to give you any reason for this other than the fact that the
                        President will not be in Washington on Monday and wants to be sure that he
                        is available when you arrive from Peking. The real reason is because
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> insists that your arrival
                        from Peking just before the Chirep vote, now scheduled for Tuesday morning,
                        would seriously jeopardize its outcome and in any event would be the subject
                        of considerable <pb n="2" xml:id="d45-02" facs="d45-02"/>criticism should
                        the vote go against us.</p>
                    <p>We met this afternoon in the President's office with <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>. This meeting indicated that chances for favorable vote
                        on <gloss target="#t_IQ1">IQ</gloss> afternoon, in <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' presence, and asked him to see
                        Lanusse immediately to urge that he vote with us on the <gloss target="#t_IQ1">IQ</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Following the meeting this afternoon, the President and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> were photographed in the Rose Garden
                        discussing the vote and Ziegler issued a statement indicating Presidential
                        support for <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s efforts on Chirep. It was a testy
                        afternoon here and I am not sure I haven't lost future utility due to the
                        resistance on both the issue of your return and too much Presidential
                        activity on Chirep.</p>
                    <p>I am sending you by separate message State's latest ploy on contingency
                        actions should we fail on important question vote. I will need your guidance
                        since it looks very worrisome in context of your Host's attitudes.</p>

                        TO LAY OVER EITHER AT ANCHORAGE OR IN HAWAII. OUR DEPARTURE WILL BE REPORTED
                        IN ANY EVENT AND THERE WILL BE SPECULATION ABOUT REASONS FOR DELAY IN
                        ARRIVAL. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED THAT MY VISIT AFFECTS THE CHIREP
                        VOTE. WHATEVER IMPACT IT HAS HAD IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED, IT WILL NOT BE
                        COMPOUNDED BY MY RETURN. IF THE ORDER STICKS, WE SHALL LAY OVER IN
                        ANCHORAGE. IT INVOLVES A BRUTAL SCHEDULE FOR EVERYBODY WITH IN EFFECT TWO
                        NIGHTS WITHOUT SLEEP. HAS THE PR IMPACT OF OUR LAYING OVER IN ANCHORAGE BEEN
                        CONSIDERED? WE WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE ON THIS.</p>

                    <p>2. AS FMR SAUDI AMENDMENT, IT IS MY CONSIDERED OPINION THAT <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> WILL CONSIDER IT INTOLERABLE AND
                        DUPLICITOUS, AFTER EXTENSIVE EXPLANATION THAT DEFEAT OF OUR CHIREP
                        RESOLUTION NOT EVEN IN <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> INTEREST.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> IS WILLING TO TOLERATE OUR
                        PRESENT COURSE ESPECIALLY TOWARDS PRESIDENT AND ROGERS IF WE WIN PRESENT
                        CHIREP RESOLUTION, WE CAN GET BY WITHOUT UNDUE STRAIN. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> HAS HOWEVER INSISTED AT EVERY SESSION
                        THAT <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> WILL NEVER HOLD STILL FOR THE
                        ELABORATION OF NEW LEGAL STATUS FOR TAIWAN. HE HAS CRITICIZED EVEN ALBANIAN
                        RESOLUTION FOR LEAVING THIS OPEN. AN OFFICIAL U.S. EXPLANATION REPEATING THE
                        JUNE FIASCO THAT LEGAL STATUS OF TAIWAN IS UNDETERMINED WOULD BE ALMOST AS
                        BAD AN AFFRONT, TO DO SO SO SOON AFTER <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> MADE THESE POINTS EXPLICITLY TO ME CAN HAVE ONLY ONE
                        OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCE. U.S. SUPPORT FOR SAUDI RESOLUTION SHOULD THEREFORE BE
                        TAKEN IN FULL AWARENESS THAT IT UNDERCUTS ENTIRE BASIS OF PRESENT APPROACH
                        TO PEKING AND ALL OF THIS FOR AN AMENDMENT WHICH IN MY JUDGMENT HAS NO
                        CHANCE WHATEVER OF BEING ACCEPTED. IF WE CANNOT GET A MAJORITY FOR THE
                        RELATIVELY SAFE IQ HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY GET ONE FOR THIS WHICH IS AN EVEN
                        SHARPER VERSION OF DUAL REPRESENTATION. PLEASE MAKE THIS CLEAR TO THE
                        PRESIDENT—IF NECESSARY, BY READING THIS PARAGRAPH TO HIM.</p>

                    <p>(There was some informal discussion of a picture on the wall of a place near
                        Vietnam and how it evoked the landscape of Vietnam.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister,
                        when you mentioned the intelligence plane yesterday…</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The number was wrong, not <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>-2 - <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>-71, It
                        has the same sound in Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understood what you
                        were talking about. I wasn't absolutely sure whether or not you were perhaps
                        mistaken, and therefore I checked in Washington. And I have found that your
                        information was correct, although I am told the closest it came was 20 miles
                        to Chinese territory.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: [Interpreter gesturing to
                        indicate meaning] In various places.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d48-02" facs="d48-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because it flew along the
                        border, and came close to the Chinese border at various points, at various
                        provinces. (He named them.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At any rate, this was
                        not a flight that was authorized from Washington. Perhaps Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MCAJS1">McCain</persName> is not as harmless, as I said
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He sent some planes to have a
                        look around the other places and also to have a look at places around the
                        eastern part of the border. Of course, it was outside our present
                        territorial sea, but our radars could see them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we have stopped
                        this particular kind of flight until we have a full review of the program,
                        when I return.</p>
                    <p>I also have one other piece of information which I wanted to tell the Prime
                        Minister. We have a report that the Chinese Nationalists on the Taiwan
                        General Staff are considering flying a R-104 reconnaissance aircraft over
                        the mainland in order to disrupt our policy and our talks. We are trying to
                        stop it, but I want you to know that if it should occur, it is without our
                        permission and against our opposition. I don't even know what an R-104
                        is.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: (laughs) It's a kind of
                        reconnaissance plane anyway.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right. I don't
                        think it's a high-altitude plane.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's the kind that comes to
                        harrass us sometimes. We can often distinguish between <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s planes and your planes,
                        between the planes you fly and the planes you have given them to fly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: None of our planes fly
                        into the mainland.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But if we know they take off
                        from Taiwan, then, generally speaking, they are <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s planes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's correct.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d48-03" facs="d48-03"/>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There is only one day left so we
                        must step up in our work, and that's how things always come out. Of course,
                        it's not the announcement of your present visit—that's easy to deal with. We
                        have a draft of the announcement we consider it possible to make, on your
                        present visit after you leave. We can give it to you. It's very simple. But
                        the task is very clear, that is, to decide the date of the President's
                        visit. We are preparing to announce it as next February, but not to put in
                        the specific date, to maintain security and for other reasons. You can
                        either decide it yourself, or give us a reply after you go back and talk
                        with the President.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can do it in two
                        stages; it's up to you. We can say something about my visit here which
                        doesn't include a date, and then on a date which we mutually agree or we can
                        announce the President's visit, that it will be in February.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That would be all right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We could say, for
                        example, the preparations for the visit have gone well, and we will announce
                        the date later.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You probably have drafted it
                        already.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will look at yours
                        and then see.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will put them together. Maybe
                        it won't be as good-as yours. (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> handed over the U.S. draft.)</p>
                    <p>Maybe “arrangements” would be better than “plans.” Maybe you call your thick
                        book the “plans.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But if the Prime
                        Minister thinks he can skip the thick book by changing a word, he
                        underestimates our bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Perhaps you read them through,
                        but I only glanced over the outlines.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I read them through
                        because it may not look like this to you, but we reduced the number in a
                        brutal fashion.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Therefore out of our regard for
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s efforts with having
                        cut down drastically the numbers, we haven't touched the numbers. There have
                        been some small disputes, but I think they will be settled peacefully.</p>
                    <p>And because your security officers said it will be too troublesome for the
                        President to stay overnight in three separate places, we are planning to
                        omit the visit to Hangchow. Because in February the weather might not be so
                        good there. Possibly snow might be there at that time of year, and you have
                        enough snow in the United States. You don't have to come here for that. So
                        there will be two places, Peking and Shanghai. So if we would like that, we
                        can cut out one day and make it six, that is neither five nor seven, a
                        conciliation between the two. One day in Shanghai and five in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am prepared to raise
                        the issue of Hangchow with the President because both you and the Vice
                        Chairman said it is such a picturesque site, and I am prepared to raise the
                        issue. Maybe the way we should leave it is if the President can stay seven
                        days, we go to Hangchow, and if he can stay only six days we leave it at
                        Peking and Shanghai.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But this is entirely up
                        to you, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There is no question on our
                        side. It's the Secret Service people, because they say that if the President
                        is going to stay overnight in a third place, they will have to have an
                        increased group of people to prepare the place he is going to stay
                        overnight. Otherwise the President can only be there during the daylight. Of
                        course, it doesn't take long to get there—only a half hour's flight. If the
                        President would like to go to Hangchow, he can go there in the daytime, and
                        go back to Shanghai at night. That would make it easier for the Secret
                        Service people. But there is a small villa beside the west lake at Hangchow,
                        and maybe when Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> sees it she
                        won't want to go back to Shanghai, and that will make the Secret Service
                        people nervous.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let us worry about the
                        Secret Service. They are professionally nervous.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course in any of the places
                        where we take the President we will guarantee the security.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The job of the Secret
                        Service is to be obsessed with security, but the President is not obsessed
                        with security.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That will make them even more

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Until this trip the
                        President didn't know how many Secret Service agents he had with him.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But if he knew he probably would
                        be dissatisfied with them, and criticize them. It would make their work more
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's true. What
                        happened was that he criticized them and now they are angry with me.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So it is better not to tell
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will take it up with
                        him. If they want to bring in another small group of Secret Service men,
                        will that make it impossible for you?</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course. We didn't
                        even submit anything on Vietnam.</p>

                        ground through peaceful negotiations. And we can say it's a kind of example
                        to the world. And when we are discussing the draft communique for the
                        President's visit then the other colleagues who came with you can see the

                        going to see it because the Secret Service can see if the road and other
                        matters are all right. The last time when the Emperor came, I took him
                        there. It took less than four hours; the road is quite smooth.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a complaint.
                        They told us today we would be back at 12:00 and we got back at two minutes
                        after 12:00. It's the first time you were not exactly on time.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Usually you arrive
                        here on the second you say you are going to. But I think this is a good
                        plan.</p>

                        and see whether it will or will not be convenient for the President to see

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And don't take
                        everything they say absolutely seriously. If any questions come up, talk to
                        me. I am not sure they have completely understood the legal aspects of

                        that you want to build a separate structure for it, and not have a 747.</p>

                        I admire it. But if they are a little slow in understanding it, forgive
                        them.</p>

                        they are used to managing the whole show, so they don't understand the
                        reason. But gradually they will be able to understand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I go back, Mr.

                        made?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean the announcement about

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When do you think?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can do it either
                        after I return or when I leave.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We can do it according to your
                        convenience, because it is best that we should always do it in the way that
                        would be convenient for the guest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then let me suggest
                        that we do it when I return because then it is easier for me to answer
                        questions about what it means. You don't have to meet the press. That would
                        make it, to be safe, let's put it on Wednesday, Washington time.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can do it either
                        time.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You leave China on the 25th,
                        then stay over in Alaska one day?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will probably stay
                        over in Alaska because we can use it to rest and because of the time change.
                        I will not be back in Washington until Tuesday evening around 6:00, which is
                        Wednesday your time.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then maybe it could be issued
                        the evening of the 27th your time, morning of the 28th our time. Is that
                        wrong?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, it's right. Our
                        best press release time would be 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon, but that's a
                        very bad time for you.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That doesn't matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then shall we say 4:00
                        on the 27th?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: 5:00 make it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Make it 5:00. We always
                        have the technical problem of the evening news; which if we don't release by
                        4:30 it will not be on the evening news.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is all right, because if we
                        release at 4:00 in the morning then it will be in the papers. All right,
                        very good.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or we can do it at

                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No, because for us 4:00 in the
                        morning means it will be in that day's papers, but in the evening it won't
                        be.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, 4:00 Washington

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In China, it will be 4:00 in the
                        morning the next day. That way we always have a day's difference. Your
                        announcement was on the 15th, ours on the 16th last time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This text, or which

                        discuss it tomorrow. How about the President's trip? When should we announce
                        that? That is up to you to decide.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me discuss it with
                        the President, and we will propose it in Paris. Toward the middle or the end
                        of November, around the 15th of November.</p>

                        thinks the end of November would be better.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The only problem we
                        have is that the press will begin to say again that there are great tensions
                        between us, and that the trip is in great difficulty.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we can hold them
                        for about two or three weeks with this announcement. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs) Let's say around November 20th
                        if that's easier for you.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean it will be too
                        difficult for you at the end of November?</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d48-11" facs="d48-11"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There are two problems.
                        One is the speculation on why we are not announcing it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And what would be difficult for
                        you if we put it earlier, toward the end of October?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The end of October?
                        Only that the President will probably…. We could do it in the first full
                        week of November, just so that there is some separation between my trip
                        and…. We want to leave some time so that it appears that the President has
                        had an opportunity to consider it. But if you want it around November 10 for
                        example, it's also possible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We also can consider it maybe,
                        and discuss it later, because we also have some of our own requirements.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The only problem is the
                        President will be away between November 24 and December 1—he is going to
                        California; there's a holiday. But I think we can find a date. We can do it
                        November 22 for example, which is the end of November.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will consider it and discuss
                        it again tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly. That's
                        easy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So if we could finish with the
                        draft communique for the President's visit speedily in the morning maybe
                        tomorrow afternoon there could be another general meeting maybe with all of
                        your staff. But if we take more time then maybe in the evening we can meet.
                        But anyway we should meet.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Maybe the Acting
                        Foreign Minister would suggest a text for the announcement of the
                        President's trip.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, he can discuss it in that
                        session.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The only problem is I
                        am afraid it will be impossible in America not to give an exact date. Too
                        many people will know; it will make it more mysterious if we don't give a
                        date.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, not the one we now
                        have; the one for the end of November. We will say the People's Republic and
                        the United States have agreed that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit should start on February 21. We need say no

                    <p>So you have to do some hard work tomorrow, and if there are some matters that
                        call for my presence, our Acting Foreign Minister can call me. Then we'll
                        have a final general meeting. That will be all right. So they can be free to
                        see the oil refinery and chemical plant tomorrow. That is alright?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is fine. One
                        question we haven't resolved is the airplane to be used when the President

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And you will not go in

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will discuss it with
                        the President. It has never been done before, but no American President has
                        ever visited China before.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will be responsible, and your
                        Secret Service men can also have a look in our plane, because everything
                        will be all right.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, I think you will
                        understand that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand very well.
                        We will find out in the discussion of the communique the point which the
                        Prime Minister raised last time about an occasional envoy which would come
                        to China to have these discussions, after the President's visit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We agree to that suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If I may—the Prime
                        Minister doesn't have to answer—I would like to say the reason we suggested
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> is that of all our
                        ambassadors, he is the one we trust most, and who is most oriented toward
                        the President. It has nothing to do with Vietnam. It will not be until July
                        anyway, and by then we hope the war will be over.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, we hope the war in Vietnam
                        will cease before the President's visit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We want you to know
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName> is a fine gentleman
                        whom we thought you would like best of all the possibilities. For selfish
                        reasons, I would like to come back, but I cannot.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because you have too many
                        affairs to attend to.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can exchange any
                        practical matters as to….. We understand that meetings will be conducted
                        like this time: restricted meetings between the President, yourself and me,
                        and then meetings between the Acting Foreign Minister and the Secretary of
                        State on other matters. That is how we will conduct it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Right. Of course, a general
                        session at the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, at the beginning
                        and at the end.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then during the meetings of
                        your President with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> it
                        will be up to the President to decide who attends.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And you will be
                        present?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. We suggest two meetings can
                        be held.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. That is very
                        acceptable to us. And in meetings between you and the President I would be
                        present.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But our Acting Foreign Minister
                        will not because he will have to show his respect to your Secretary of
                        State, and I can find other assistants.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. When I return, do
                        you object if I give a background meeting with the press similar to the last
                        one?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We don't have any objections. I
                        read the text of the briefing you gave us through Paris.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and I will do that
                        again.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They kept asking more
                        and more questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, but if you give them a
                        background briefing they perhaps will be satisfied.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I can mention
                        names of people who participated in the discussions because you mentioned it
                        in your paper.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I will only say we
                        discussed concrete arrangements. I will not say we discussed specific
                        topics, and when asked, I will only talk German philosophy.</p>

                        philosophers always have to speak of whole systems, on a scale like that, so
                        you will tire them out so much they will doze off.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They will think I am so

                        are going to conduct an underground nuclear test in the Aleutian Islands
                        between October 28th and November 10. It will take only one day, only one

                        explosion.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn't know

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a test warhead

                        things. Some day maybe others can declare like we have done that they will
                        not be the first to use them. That will end these things. That is for you to
                        consider. We put forward the idea.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I just wanted you to
                        know. Will you tell me before we leave about the situation on the Asian
                        subcontinent? I would like to discuss that and also some other things, but
                        after the draft communique for the President's visit. This should also be in

                    <p>I have again discussed with the President your schedule and its possible
                        impact on ChiRep vote. You should be aware that I strongly made the points
                        which you raised when this was discussed the first time around, especially
                        the point that your artificial stopover in Anchorage would generate
                        speculation which would be far worse than adhering to original schedule.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> both took exception to my analysis,
                        but especially <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. He stated that
                        your arrival time in Anchorage would make it perfectly understandable that
                        you would wish to have a rest before proceeding to Washington. His basic
                        argument, which the President accepted, was that your arrival just before
                        what has now become a critical <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote would
                        generate speculation about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Peking
                        relations which was bound to have an unsettling effect on fence-sitting
                        nations. The President accepted this argument and overruled me on the
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Since that confrontation, the President has talked to me twice very much
                        aware of my stated view and what he understands must be your concerns. He
                        suggested such things as a stopover in San Clemente or a revision of your
                        schedule to carry you to Hawaii <pb n="2" xml:id="d49-02" facs="d49-02"/>for
                        a day or two. I have taken the position that any artificial modification of
                        your schedule upon returning from such an important mission would be
                        surfaced for precisely what it is. I have also made the point that he has
                        ordered this without firm evidence that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote will, in fact, take place Tuesday morning although
                        every indication points to it as of this writing. It could happen that an
                        unforeseen delay would occur in the vote which means that you could still
                        arrive just before it actually occurred. The President stated that he still
                        wished to delay for 24 hours but agreed that if there were any unforeseen
                        delay in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote that you should proceed
                        with your scheduled arrival here on Tuesday afternoon. A further
                        complication in this issue has been the fact that <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> has been away for the weekend and
                        there is no rational way to talk to the President except in person.</p>
                    <p>I believe I have now pieced together the reasons for the President's giving
                        in to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> on this issue.
                        Apparently, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> contacted him
                        immediately after your departure and insisted that he be given the same
                        privilege with respect to the Moscow advance that you had enjoyed on the
                        Peking advance. When the President mentioned this to me, I stated that it
                        would be an unmitigated disaster which could not be done under any
                        circumstances. I am not sure that the President has yet turned <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> down, but I know he intends to do
                        so. I was instructed under no circumstances to mention <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' <pb n="3" xml:id="d49-03" facs="d49-03"/>approach to you. I am confident that we have given in to
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> on the issues of your
                        return as a sop which will enable us to take a tougher subsequent stand on
                        the Moscow question.</p>
                    <p>Throughout yesterday's meeting on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, it
                        was very evident that <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> is
                        attempting to again assert himself es a dominant force. This was probably
                        triggered by both the Chal Roberts and the Sherman stories in the Washington
                        Post. In any event, the cheap gamesmanship has reached the high point of my
                        memory.</p>
                    <p>If you wish, I will again raise with the President the issue of not delaying
                        your arrival. As you know, I am in complete agreement with your own views
                        and would, of course, do what you wish in any event. Two points were used as
                        counters to my original arguments. One was that your return time had been
                        fuzzed up in the original announcement so that this delay would not be the
                        source of speculation. The second was that it would be very logical for you
                        to wish to take a rest-break after such a tiring period.</p>
                    <p>When I spoke to the President privately about my concerns on delaying your
                        arrival time he stated that he was aware of all of my arguments and yours,
                        but pointed out that he was taking the action to protect you from charges
                        which would emanate from State that your trip to Peking had been at the
                        expense of Taiwan's seat. He stated <pb n="4" xml:id="d49-04" facs="d49-04"/>that you should be aware that <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had continued to take the position that the timing of
                        the trip to Peking has had a deleterious Impact on the vote and since the
                        outlook is now bleak, it is very probable that should we lose, State would
                        launch a campaign designed to place the blame on your shoulders.
                        Unfortunately, in this context the President is exactly right, although I am
                        equally convinced that the realities of the situation are that your visit
                        has had, if anything, a favorable impact on the vote and, as a minimum, the
                        pros and cons have cancelled each other out.</p>
                    <p>I have given to the President your most recent information on the
                        head-to-head session, the conclusion of technical arrangements, the
                        treatment of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote and the status of
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. He was most grateful and
                        delighted with all that has been accomplished under the most tedious
                        circumstances. I have also come down hard with State on their contingency
                        thinking with respect to the Baroody plan and believe that it is turned off
                        completely.</p>
                    <p>I will not raise with the President again the issue of your delayed return
                        until I hear further from you. In the meantime, I am concerned that
                        appropriate arrangements are made for your revised itinerary to include
                        accommodations, etc. Please keep us informed.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the President has asked me to emphasise to you in light of all the
                        foregoing the importance of avoiding any comment to <pb n="5" xml:id="d49-05" facs="d49-05"/>the press in Anchorage or elsewhere about
                        the nature of your trip until the United Nations vote is completed. lie
                        intends to meet with you as soon as you arrive here.</p>
                    <p>Warm personal regards.</p>

                        15th of November and now it will be before that, around the 8th or 10th?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: About the 8th; we are
                        not certain yet. That's why we wanted the announcement about the visit
                        around the 20th, so that the two wouldn't seem related.</p>

                        withdrawal from Vietnam, that has been decided also?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It will be another

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is not an announcement for
                        the final date for total withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are hoping to
                        negotiate that on the 1st or 8th, as I told the Prime Minister.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The 1st or 8th.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have suggested the
                        first, and I have been told that we will receive word whether the 1st or 8th
                        is acceptable.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean that if an agreement is
                        reached in your meeting about the total withdrawal of United States troops
                        in Vietnam, then the President will announce that but if not, he will anyway
                        announce a number of troops from Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I do not believe
                        we can settle negotiations by November 8, but it is my judgment that if
                        negotiations can succeed at all they should do so before the end of this
                        year.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So do we.</p>

                        relating to easing tensions in the Far East.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: After you gave us the draft
                        communique for the President's visit, we thought of various ways of dealing
                        with it. One is to give you our draft. But there was also another idea
                        because according to your original draft communique we saw you tried your
                        best to speak in general terms and use as much common terms as possible. On
                        the concrete matters you only dealt with bilateral relations, and you left
                        off other items for the development of events.</p>
                    <p>During your President's visit, as I have said, we believe the main talks will
                        be with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tsetung</persName>. And as
                        for what you put in your draft communique on the exchange of views between
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tsetung</persName> and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and the explanation of
                        their stands and points of view, and as you put in your draft communique on
                        world affairs too, that will have to be left to be seen. In this aspect the
                        two leaders have not yet met and have not had contact yet either.</p>
                    <p>As for between us two, there have been a lot of exchanges both on your last
                        visit and your present visit. And there is no question that no doubt on the
                        matter of specific issues we have both made an exposition of our own points
                        of view and stated our own positions. Of course, we have also found some
                        common ground.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the result is that our ideas regarding the joint communique for
                        the President's visit is different from yours, opposite. We would like to
                        put forward a position on specific issues. As for the general exposition of
                        our views on international affairs and the international situation, and our
                        stand and views and so on, if these are to be written in a joint communique
                        then there is the question that the leaders, that is Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tsetung</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, have not met. But we can think of
                        some possibilities now.</p>
                    <p>So after going back yesterday and studying your draft and also after
                        reporting to <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tsetung</persName>, we feel
                        there are difficulties in drafting such a communique at the present time.
                        For instance, in your original draft there also were some general
                        principles. In your draft we found there were some general principles and in
                        this aspect we found you tried to put in common points, but we found that in
                        reality there were some points in which we would not agree.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d51-04" facs="d51-04"/>
                    <p>And we also found that there were some points in the draft communique, in the
                        part on general principles, that we think when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> comes to visit China he will have
                        quite full discussions with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                            Tsetung</persName> on. During your previous visit I said something in
                        regard to these aspects, but during this visit I have not said much about
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What aspects?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The general approach to the
                        international situation. (<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        nods) You used of course some of our terms, but the prospects for the future
                        and the explanations for these terms are, of course, entirely different. Of
                        course, in your draft you also used some of our terms, that is that “turmoil
                        still exists in many parts of the world,” and that “the danger of military
                        conflict remains.” But not only the danger of military conflict, but
                        military conflict and wars exist in the world today. And your way of
                        resolving this is to do it in accordance with general principles which you
                        enumerate in the draft, to take steps to eliminate their causes, that is the
                        causes of military conflict and turmoil. Last time when we met I mentioned
                        that point, that there is great chaos in the world.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I remember very
                        well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And that since the Second World
                        War local and regional wars have not ceased, and especially in the Far East,
                        the situation in the Far East proves the situation. Why are there
                        differences in our views in relation to this matter? Last time after you
                        left, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made a
                        statement in which he admitted the changes in the world. That is, before you
                        came last time, your President made a statement in which he admitted changes
                        in the world, and before you came this time, he made another speech in which
                        he reiterated his views in his inauguration speech on a “generation of
                        peace.”</p>
                    <p>What is the real situation? What does a generation of peace mean? Maybe it is
                        like what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wrote about
                        in a certain book which we know you are interested in, and that is the span
                        of time of peace by Metternich. Of course, we notice you have not mentioned
                        this for a long time. But that has made me go back to review the history of
                        the French Revolution and the history of the American War of Independence.
                            <pb n="5" xml:id="d51-05" facs="d51-05"/>That was a time of great
                        revolutions when feudal rulers were being swept away and the world was
                        entering a time of bourgeois democracy. Of course, you are all very familiar
                        with the American War of Independence. In that time three million soldiers
                        in the United States under Washington resisted the British colonial policy
                        and embarked on a war of independence. The war lasted eight years, and those
                        were pioneers in independence, although the British at that time had a great
                        empire and the sun never set on the British flag. At that time the British
                        Empire was most proud, believing itself in a Victorian Age.</p>
                    <p>At that time there was only one country, France, and not even the strength of
                        the whole country of France but only the part with Layfayette, who went to
                        the United States to assist the revolution. And it was only because of this
                        war of revolution that the United States made such great strides towards
                        development in the 20th Century. Of course there was the Civil War which was
                        before the developments of the 20th Century. This proves that a minority can
                        be victorious over the majority and the weak over the strong and the little
                        over the big.</p>
                    <p>But the present population of Cambodia is even more than the population of
                        the United States in Washington's time, three million only. Why was it
                        possible for the Americans in that time to be victorious? Because there was
                        a new emerging force. And it applied tactics that were of a guerrilla style,
                        which we mentioned last time. We mentioned last time that it was George
                        Washington who had initial guerrilla warfare. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and the Vietnamese people had not
                        appeared then. The Americans were the first to employ guerrilla warfare and
                        be victorious in it, and this is a very good lesson to the people of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>We know that you wish that your President continue to be President of the
                        United States to preside over the 200th Anniversary of America. If it should
                        be said by a President that it was not easy for Washington at that time to
                        win victory, and this is worth the pride of the people of America, then the
                        many people in the world at present who wish to win liberation could also
                        win on that example, to rely on one's strength. There is no reason why you
                        should say it should not be done; and they should be supported. The last
                        instance was the French Revolution.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d51-06" facs="d51-06"/>
                    <p>The American Revolution was a war against colonialism while the French
                        Revolution was against the oppressors of that time. The present national day
                        of France is exactly the day when the Bastille —</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: During which the domestic
                        oppressive rulers were over thrown. At that time Louis the XVI had strong
                        military forces. The strength of the revolutionary fighters came from all
                        parts of the country including the south, and their weapons were backward,
                        but the result was that the Bastille was stormed successfully, that was on
                        July 14, 1789. The results were great victories that began the French
                        Revolution. And although during his later days Napoleon restored the Empire
                        and met defeat following that on the battlefields of Spain and Moscow, the
                        great victories of the French Revolution have become a brilliant page of
                        victory in history.</p>
                    <p>And these two examples have been two examples acknowledged by all in regard
                        to the history of the peoples of the world to win independence, not to
                        mention the victories of the Paris Commune and the October revolution which
                        furthered victories for the peoples of the world. But I only speak of the
                        first two examples, of bourgeois revolutions, one against foreign aggression
                        and the other against domestic oppression. Was Metternich able to obstruct
                        all these developments? To speak of the factor of time, Metternich, we
                        think, was only to maintain the role, indeed able to maintain office, for
                        only 39 years. I'm not speaking of the time as Foreign Minister. As Prime
                        Minister his period was only 27 years. He organized the Holly Alliance after
                        the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire. From 1815 he began the Holy Alliance.
                        The main three components of the Holy Alliance were Austria, Prussia and
                        Russia. The great majority of all the feudal countries of Europe of that
                        time joined in that Holy Alliance.</p>
                    <p>But by 1830 revolutions in Europe had begun to arise and the Holy Alliance in
                        Europe had started to crumble. So by the time of 1848 revolutions in Europe
                        had risen up in a great degree to effect the complete disintegration of the
                        Holy Alliance.</p>
                    <p>No matter whether it was maintained for 15 years or 33 years, it was not able
                        to destruct (obstruct) the development of revolution in Europe. It was the
                        revolutions that promoted the progress in Europe. The result was <pb n="7" xml:id="d51-07" facs="d51-07"/>that the western countries, in comparison
                        to countries in the east, were able to make great progress in that era,
                        while the Holy Alliance maintained by Metternich was only able to remain for
                        15 - 33 years. Of course, that may also be considered a generation of peace,
                        but that peace was not dependable because the times were advancing.</p>
                    <p>As we are now discussing the present situation I would say that the turmoil
                        in the world today was greater than after the collapse of Napoleon's Empire
                        and after the French Revolution. That time it was only Europe. Of course, at
                        that time Metternich by his policies had attempted to oppress the
                        revolutions in Latin America to an extent, but now the turmoil is of a major
                        character. At the present time, it is not only the people of Europe but
                        Asia, Africa, Japan and America itself that have reason to ask for
                        reform.</p>
                    <p>One instance that is different from that time—there are now nuclear weapons
                        that didn't exist at that time, but nuclear weapons cannot be called an
                        isolated era in itself. But isn't it the era of the people? Because without
                        people nothing can be accomplished, and now hundreds of millions upon
                        millions of people are awakening.</p>
                    <p>This awakening consciousness of the people is promoting changes in the world,
                        or we might call it turmoil. And the oppressed nations, no matter where they
                        may be, wish to win liberation as the American people did during its
                        independence war. While the local strength is weak, they will inevitably
                        become strong. For instance, how can it be conceived that the people in
                        Angola, Mozambique, South Africa and Southwest Africa and Namibia are being
                        enslaved and cannot win while the others' forces have the backing of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>? But these people are bound to win
                        liberation as the American people won several years ago.</p>
                    <p>That is not to mention other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in
                        which nations are oppressed and submerged and their internal affairs
                        interfered in. There the current of national liberation cannot be
                        obstructed. It is also true that such liberation must be won by the people
                        of that place and not by foreign forces. Although Layfayette assisted with a
                        small force the American people won the war of independence through their
                        own efforts. Of course, there was great moral support but the American
                        people relied mainly on direct struggle. That is one current.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d51-08" facs="d51-08"/>
                    <p>Another international current is the struggle against domestic oppressors,
                        like the French people who opposed Louis the XVI at that time because while
                        there is oppression there will be the struggle against oppression. Just like
                        the French people, who had very poor weapons, were able to storm
                        successfully the Bastille which was defended by armies of Louis the XVI who
                        had strong weapons.</p>
                    <p>And for an example during the latter part of the 20th Century we can count
                        China among them. Other instances involving the United States during the
                        latter part of the 20th Century would be the peoples of Indochina—the
                        peoples of Vietnam. I don't think that those lessons of history that have
                        been taught us need be repeated, but they should be taken as reference. And
                        therefore if the U.S. wishes to ease tension in the Far East, we should also
                        take as reference these two instances. That is to return to the question of
                        old friends. If too much account is taken of those, the old friends, then
                        the course Metternich embarked on is bound to be repeated. Why did I say
                        this today? Because since we are exchanging opinions it is better to be more
                        straightforward. Because otherwise if the old friend, <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, is to be discarded then the
                        next day will be Nguyen Van Thieu, and then next Park, <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SM4">Sirik
                            Matak</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>. These
                        people will be chased off the stage of history by their own peoples. And if
                        the hope of easing tension in the Far East is to be placed on such people,
                        there will be no hope of easing tension because such people want to oppress
                        the people where they are and expand to other regions. Because although your
                        President may arm your partners through the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, the factor of weapons is only a temporary
                        factor which can be used for a future period of time but those people will
                        be inevitably defeated through the struggle of the people where they
                        dominate. Even though the turmoil and danger of military conflict will be
                        attempted to be eliminated in our formulation, that is the five principles
                        of peaceful co-existence, and though the subjective attempt may be to
                        establish a peaceful region or an era of peace, I don't think that will be
                        possible, because, as I said last time and would like to reaffirm today, the
                        oppressed nations want liberation and the view of history of the United
                        States, it is, we believe, that people should be allowed to win liberation
                        through their own efforts.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d51-09" facs="d51-09"/>
                    <p>Of course, as I mentioned, I believe on the first or second day of your
                        arrival here, when we say “down with imperialism” that is only an empty
                        cannon. For our part it is an empty cannon but it also has a rallying
                        effect. Of course, when we mention imperialism now it has a double
                        character—not only the old but the new social imperialism. But if the
                        nations of those areas wish to arise and drive out foreign oppressors then
                        no one can obstruct that development. The more the oppression, the more the
                        aggression and armed subversion, the more stiring of the people. They are
                        bound to rise up and overthrow the foreign aggressors.</p>
                    <p>I also mentioned during our talks that we must thank after all first Japanese
                        imperialism and then United States imperialism for the liberation of China.
                        Because they gave impetus to the awakening conscience of the Chinese people,
                        to their taking action and being unified on a broader scale than before.</p>
                    <p>What about the domestic oppressors, like those who oppressed the French
                        people in the age of the French Revolution? I believe that the present
                        awakening of the conscience of the people of the world is of a world
                        character, that is broader than during the French Revolution in Europe. And
                        if all those domestic local oppressors are considered old friends, then they
                        will have to be discarded one after the other. And if President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> finds it difficult to believe after
                        the Second World War that prestige should be at such a low level 25 years
                        afterwards, then if support is to be given to such old friends, then 20-25
                        years from now there will be none in sight and defeat will be even more
                        disastrous.</p>
                    <p>I believe in our talks Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        has mentioned a truce, that is that after the United States troops have
                        withdrawn from Indochina they would pay no attention to what evolutions will
                        take place there after they withdraw. Of course, that is done in a passive
                        spirit, that you would no longer be able to pay attention to control of that
                        area. You mentioned this time Indochina in a slightly different way, that is
                        if agreement could be reached between the United States and Indochinese
                        people, then beginning at the time when the peace was signed new elections
                        would be held six months thereafter, and one month before that the local
                        rulers would resign and elections would be held in accordance with the
                        people of that area. That was slightly different from the original plan.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d51-10" facs="d51-10"/>
                    <p>But there is one thing I cannot say anything about in a detailed way because
                        you didn't give me the whole picture. We can say there are three
                        possibilities. One is Vietnamization, that is if the aim of the peace that
                        is signed is to continue to rearm the forces of Thieu.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And if although the U.S. forces
                        have been withdrawn the result of the elections is still <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Nguyen Van Thieu</persName> or his representative,
                        then after a number of years revolution will arise again and the second
                        question will arise—shall or shall not the United States go there to support
                        its new friends? And the question will again arise of intervention in the
                        affairs of others.</p>
                    <p>The third choice would be, in foresight of these events, to act in accordance
                        with the fifth point of the seven put forward by Madame Binh, and for which
                        you expressed appreciation last time. If that would be so, we would be able
                        to make new progress and this new friend made under these circumstances
                        would be more reliable.</p>
                    <p>If you take China as a case, the lesson of China is worth remembering. That
                        is if Truman had at that time not taken measures to blockade the Taiwan
                        Straits with the 7th Fleet, and not given military assistance to <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, but had continued the
                        former policy, that is no interest in Taiwan territories, then Sino-U. S.
                        relations might have been completely different these past 22 years.</p>
                    <p>Why am I mentioning this? Because we have a common point in wishing to ease
                        tension in the Far East which will be conducive to peace in the whole world.
                        And that will involve this matter: shall this generation of peace be based
                        on hopes for the future or on old friends? This is a point of fundamental
                        difference between us.</p>
                    <p>There is the possibility that after a lot of discussion you will maintain
                        your position and I will maintain ours. And there also is the possibility
                        that when your President comes to talk with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> they will discuss more profoundly and
                        with more foresight, but the conclusions will be the same. Of course,
                        Sino-American relations are bound to be improved, but that will only be
                        temporary and after a period of time with events the situation will change,
                        maybe after 10-20 years, like the <pb n="11" xml:id="d51-11" facs="d51-11"/>Metternich generation of peace. What good will come of that? In that we
                        have not given impetus to the progress of the world. Of course, perhaps
                        limited by your system, you are unable to make any greater changes while we,
                        due to our philosophy, foresee such a thing.</p>
                    <p>And therefore if new events are to occur then new tensions will also
                        arise.</p>
                    <p>For instance, as I mentioned in Indochina, if the United States forces and
                        the other forces that followed it into Indochina do not withdraw completely,
                        we will, of course, support the peoples of Indochina to pursue in their war
                        of resistance to the end, and the result of that will be new tensions.</p>
                    <p>So with regard to this question, that is the question of the evaluation of
                        the situation, if we do not put this clearly but fuss over it in ambiguous
                        terms, we should say that the fundamental differences have not been stated
                        clearly. That is if the draft communique is to be written as you have it,
                        (reading from 1st draft at Tab A) that is:</p>
                    <p>“The two leaders acknowledged that the long-standing differences between the
                        two countries not only in their bilateral relations but in their perspective
                        of international problems would not quickly or easily be resolved. At the
                        same time, the two sides agreed that the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to China and the hospitable reception
                        accorded him demonstrate that countries, irrespective of their social
                        systems, can work together toward resolution of differences in the interest
                        of international peace and security.”</p>
                    <p>Then the impression that is given to other people of the world will not be an
                        honest one and we cannot agree. The Soviet Union would agree to such terms
                        but not put it into effect. But on our side if we agree to do something we
                        will truly do it.</p>
                    <p>Therefore we think that we should take this problem seriously and state
                        clearly the fundamental differences between us because otherwise if we used
                        such wording it would give an untruthful appearance to the world. We cited
                        just now two instances, one is the war of independence which is <pb n="12" xml:id="d51-12" facs="d51-12"/>war against foreign aggressors. That is
                        one kind. One is resistance against domestic oppressors, like the French
                        Revolution. The third, which was not mentioned and which we would like to
                        put forward in our draft, is resistance to racial discrimination.</p>
                    <p>We have also thought of the matter that if we do not first state this to you
                        clearly and just hand over a draft it will not be easy to reach agreement
                        orally. I said I would like to have the Acting Foreign Minister discuss the
                        draft with you, but because of these reasons I was compelled to come myself.
                        Of course, what you say we think to be subversion, you think of as
                        revolution. Our stands and explanations also differ. But the objective trend
                        of the development of events is indestructible. It cannot be altered by the
                        subjective will of men. And if we wish to ease the tension in the Far East
                        we think this fundamental issue should be dealt with in clear terms.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which fundamental
                        issues?</p>

                        the Prime Minister mean by racial discrimination?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: For example, Africa. As also the
                        untouchables in India. That is also a form of racial discrimination. And
                        also in America in the past there has been discrimination against colored
                        people and in such matters, of course, we always sympathize with the
                        oppressed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But the Prime Minister,
                        is under no illusion that we will tolerate any discussion of our domestic

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, I have not dealt with
                        the question of racial discrimination in detail today. I have only gone into
                        detail on the first two instances. Therefore in the presentations of such
                        views we think it is not possible to let our views with regard to easing of
                        tensions in the Far East go unclear.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d51-13" facs="d51-13"/>
                    <p>And so in view of such matters, if we were to put forward a draft communique
                        at the present time the end result will be endless discussion or disputes.
                        That is why I have come myself to discuss the fundamental issues, that is
                        the assessment of the situation. Therefore, we think it is rather difficult
                        to confirm a common draft on which we can agree. Therefore, rather than you
                        and the Acting Foreign Minister going on in endless disputes, I thought it
                        would be better for me to come to give you the fundamental issues
                        myself.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I am finished with this part
                        dealing with the situation and prospects for the future, because you
                        mentioned in the draft the review of world affairs between the President and
                        Chairman Mao Tsetung.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have raised two
                        problems. The first is what we believe and the second is what can be said
                        after the President's visit.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the first problem, the Prime Minister has expressed himself
                        with his characteristic clarity, and it contained no surprises. I am fully
                        aware of your point of view. You stated it eloquently the last time and you
                        have repeated it in greater detail today. We respect you as a man of
                        principle and we have gone to considerable lengths not to cooperate in any
                        design that would create doubts about your basic positions. We have done
                        nothing that would leave doubts about your basic positions.</p>
                    <p>Now I will not comment about the policies of Metternich. I have trouble
                        enough discussing American foreign policy without discussing the foreign
                        policy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the Prime Minister.

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The lesson of history
                        is that no peace is every permanent and no social system has ever

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The question is whether the

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They have to be based
                        on reality and that will define their permanent character.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is, it will decide, in our
                        view, the matter—decide whether it is forward looking or backward.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with that as an
                        abstract proposition. The only thing is that one country should not say that
                        by definition everything it does is forward looking and everything the other
                        country does is backward looking, because that would be conducting foreign
                        policy like professors.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is decided by whether the
                        majority of the people support or do not support the policy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: For instance, the war in
                        Indochina is not supported by the majority, but the improvement of
                        Sino-American relations is supported by the majority although there is a
                        minority against it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is obvious that on
                        many important points we have a different world outlook. As I told you at
                        our first meeting, we are prepared to submit this difference to the judgment
                        of the majority and future majorities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, both history and the press
                        are merciless.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is correct. Nor do
                        I have trouble understanding that revolutions are always started by
                        minorities nor do I have trouble understanding that the superiority of
                        revolutions at the beginning is psychological, not physical.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is, the aspect?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Correct. When the Prime
                        Minister asked what do we mean by a generation of peace I would reply that
                        we think peace has two aspects at least: a sense of participation by the
                        people concerned so that they think the peace is just, and secondly, a sense
                        of security so that they do not believe the peace is oppressive. It may be
                        that you <pb n="15" xml:id="d51-15" facs="d51-15"/>and we—it is a case that
                        you and we have different views on different parts of the world on how to
                        bring this about. I can only repeat that we are prepared to submit this
                        difference to the judgment of history and we will not use force to settle
                        it. We will treat you with respect and on the basis of equality.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I believe that will be so
                        between our two countries. But the matter is that with regard to all
                        countries we should not intervene in their affairs and we should support the
                        national liberation of all peoples and not interfere, whether the country is
                        big or small. Big countries should especially not interfere in the affairs
                        of small countries. Especially, as put in your draft, no country should make
                        efforts to establish hegemony and no major power should collude with any
                        country, and we think that is especially true.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                        claims his side is serious and does what it says. We claim the same thing
                        for ourselves, and if we put something on paper it is with the intention of
                        keeping it. I have tried to explain to the Prime Minister in the many
                        meetings we have been privileged to have that on a number of issues he
                        raised we were prepared to let the historical evolution be the ultimate
                        judge. This is a professorial way of stating the doctrine of
                        non-intervention.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it is not acceptable for us to be told that we must give up
                        immediately all old friends. It cannot be abasis for a sound foreign policy
                        that we begin our new relationship with you with acts of betrayal. You could
                        not respect us for that. The Prime Minister knows very well, and his subtle
                        understanding of history will no doubt make clear, that what has already
                        started between us has unleashed forces in Japan, Taiwan and Korea that have
                        their own momentum, and we were not naive to think this would not happen. We
                        did this in full consciousness of what would happen.</p>
                    <p>What I have appreciated about our conversations until now is that between you
                        and us we seem to understand what can be done immediately, what can be done
                        over a longer period of tine, and that we would work within that spirit. We
                        have paid a price already with many of our friends, and we know what the
                        impact of what you and, I are talking about will be on many of our friends.
                        We do not give them a veto over our policies, and we will not maintain them
                        against the forces of history. But at the same time you could not respect us
                        if we found this easy, and you must not attempt to push the process beyond
                        what is possible.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d51-16" facs="d51-16"/>
                    <p>Now the Prime Minister has pointed out the failings of our friends. And I
                        have indicated that we have been prepared to separate ourselves from them on
                        many important issues. We have never asked anything from you with respect to
                        your friends. [to the interpreter—“Did you translate that we have never
                        asked you to separate yourselves from your friends?” The interpreter further
                        translates]. But it would be an amazing occurrence in history if your
                        friends claimed for themselves what the Pope has for himself, namely, total
                        infallibility.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have never believed that.
                        Even in our own ranks there is no one who has committed no mistakes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And therefore while we
                        have not asked you to do this and while we do not ask you if you have done
                        this, we still believe some personal advice to your friends, at least with
                        respect to your judgment of our sincerity, might accelerate the process
                        which we both desire. The reason why the relationship between our two people
                        has seemed to me so important is precisely because I respect your moral
                        force. But also because our two peoples have it in their hands to contribute
                        to the peace in the Pacific and in the world.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would like to add something
                        here. Although we do not wish to impose our views on others, we can as you
                        just now mentioned, by our own action and influence, affect our friends
                        around us. That is, by our own action and influence we can affect friends
                        around us not to go to certain extremes. That's one point. The second is
                        that we can through our own influence not allow another still greater power
                        far away to feel easy in coming into the Far East for hegemony. But of
                        course we cannot do anything about Japan, say, or the Indian Ocean because
                        those are places where you are in control.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister has
                        not dealt lately with the Indians or he would not say we are in complete
                        control.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: True indeed, and precisely we
                        have no influence in that place. We cannot do anything about it. Nor do we
                        approve of contending for hegemony in that area. Nor do we wish to join in
                        that game. We are opposed to power politics and to superpowers. Of course,
                        you can reply to us that you are not the only one. If you were the only one,
                        no such question would arise.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the Indian Ocean,
                        Mr. Prime Minister, we suffer the illusion that we are supporting one of
                        your friends against one of your neighbors that is attempting to achieve
                        hegemony.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: True, but we have many
                        offers from India to contend with you and your neighbor and that is
                        recommended by most of the bureaucracy, If we wanted domination on the
                        Indian subcontinent, we would not support Pakistan because Pakistan cannot
                        dominate the Indian subcontinent, as you well know.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Indeed, it is impossible for
                        Pakistan to do so but it is also impossible for India to do that. What India
                        wants to do as I have said last time during your visit is to get two big
                        powers to contend for it in the Indian Ocean so it can make use of both.
                        That's a most stupid policy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we are not
                        participating in that. If any country achieves hegemony there other than
                        India, it will be your neighbor and not the United States. (laughter)</p>

                    <p>We believe that the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> can be an historic occasion. But he is not coming here
                        to be put into the dock and to be accused of a whole series of American
                        misdeeds. That is not possible. “In dock” means in court. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> thought it meant in ships.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will not put him in
                        ships.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But you cannot put him
                        in court either.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Some believe two devils will
                        meet. That is the view of some. And neither of them will be able to
                        administer judgment on the other.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is more important
                        is that neither should attempt to make judgment on the other.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So if a trial is impossible, it
                        is even more impossible to pass a judgment. The important thing is because
                        our world outlooks are obviously different, the important thing is to
                        exchange different views on the world and prospects. This is not a judgment
                        on anyone, to make these views clear. There is no question that we would
                        also be willing to hear your views on various matters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand that
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> did not fight for 50
                        years to change his opinions because an American President is visiting China
                        for six or seven days.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: True. We want an exchange of
                        opinions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we want an exchange
                        of opinions that looks to the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So precisely because of that
                        historical lessons should not go unheeded.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can be sure we know
                        your views already. We know that there are other countries with whom it is
                        easier to draft communiques, though they do not always publish the same
                        text. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But it is easier to reach
                        abstract agreements that will not be put into force.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's exactly right,
                        and that's why what we say will be more important than what may be said at
                        other meetings that will take place during the next year. Let me say
                        something about the communique.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On most of our visits
                        we publish no communique at all. On this occasion we think it is desirable
                        because there are many people who are hoping that our relationship will
                        fail. I recognize that it is inconsistent with your position to publish a
                        series of banalities that can be interpreted by everyone in his own way. We
                        do not object, and I recognize that some of the drafting that was done in
                        our proposal has than tendency.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: Which tendency?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Towards the banal. We
                        therefore do not object to your stating your view and we stating our
                        view.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d51-19" facs="d51-19"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then we can find some common
                        points.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But it would be highly
                        undesirable if the communique could be read as simply a vehicle for you to
                        indict our position. If after the President comes back to America it can be
                        said that he was humiliated by going to China, it will affect your
                        relationship not only with this President but also with any possible
                        successor. And therefore it is necessary that the theme of the communique
                        be: here are two great countries with differences in their points of view
                        and here is what they can do together or in parallel, or what they can agree
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Now the question is how do we express it and when do we work on it? It is
                        true that our two leaders have not met. But it is also true that the Prime
                        Minister reflects the views of the Chairman and I reflect the views of the
                        President. My concern is that if we wait until after they have met the
                        pressure of the events that take place during that week, with 80 American
                        newsmen constantly asking questions and various members of the bureaucracy
                        present with their own suggestions, we will not be able to work as
                        substantially as we can now when we can still speak openly and with plenty
                        of time.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, yesterday we heard you were
                        chased twice by correspondents. Once in the Summer Palace, a North
                        Vietnamese correspondent took quite a lot of pictures. We didn't pay
                        attention at that time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At the Summer
                        Palace?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You probably thought he was
                        Chinese, and we thought he was Chinese, but when we inquired we found out he
                        was a photographer of North Vietnam. Then later in the afternoon you went
                        shopping…</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I foresaw what would
                        happen and I left after five minutes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I heard about that. It was
                        proved later on that the foreigners in the store immediately mobilized the
                        foreign correspondents in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's why I left.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That was a very wise move.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They all concentrated
                        on Miss Pineau who is slightly more attractive than I.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="d51-20" facs="d51-20"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is easier for her to deal
                        with them. There is no way out for you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is true. Under the
                        pressure of the visit when I must look after the President and cannot spend
                        all my time as I can here, when there are a number of functions that must be
                        performed and when there are others present, it will be much more difficult
                        to do a communique that reflects our best positions than it is now when we
                        can speak openly. Of course we understand if anything happens in the
                        conversations between Chairman Mao and the President that we have not
                        foreseen that everything will be changed.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we would use the document as a general guidance only for the
                        President and not show it to anybody except the immediate advisors of the
                        President and no one in the bureaucracy. That is no one except in this room.
                        And, of course, we would not tell anybody that we have a tentative working
                        outline. That can be in nobody's interest. But if the Prime Minister is
                        travelling with the President it will be very difficult to arrange meetings
                        for extended discussions and if the Foreign Minister is with the Secretary
                        of State, it will be very difficult technically to do it while I am here
                        next time.</p>
                    <p>But it is up to you, Mr. Prime Minister. You said to a group of Americans the
                        other day that if the visit succeeds that is fine, and if it doesn't that is
                        fine also. We do not agree fully because we think it is in the interest of
                        humanity for it to succeed. But our interest must be mutual, and there are
                        many forces around the world who would like to see it not succeed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I did not say it would be good
                        or fine if it failed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or all right.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I said it would be fine if it
                        succeeded and wouldn't matter if it failed also. You have to be prepared for
                        another alternative, otherwise how could one exist? You can't just worry
                        about success. Your President also has spoken about this eventuality.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are also prepared
                        for this alternative.</p>

                        have in the draft communique, we do not expect too great a speed in the
                        development of our relationship. Wonders will not happen suddenly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have stated my views
                        with the same frankness as the Prime Minister stated his, and I now wonder

                    <p>We have considered this matter of the communique between your President and

                        must make changes in your draft. And we have raised <pb n="22" xml:id="d51-22" facs="d51-22"/>a number of questions and also new
                        specific questions as well on Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, India and
                        Pakistan. In addition to making an estimate of the general situation, there
                        are also a number of these specific questions. We can see that there are
                        certain differences between the two sides. On some questions the differences
                        are quite large, and we believe we need quite some time for work in drafting
                        this communique. Of course, as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> just said, if in the future meeting between the
                        two leaders, in their future discussions, some problems are solved and some
                        views changed, we will need a new document, which can be done easily.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is easy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We need not consider that now.
                        The question now is how to consider such a document before they have met. So
                        this is rather a complicated matter. If we were to mention all our points of
                        view that is also possible but will take a period of time. I could cite an
                        example. I will not talk in general matters for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Say, for example, the Taiwan question. It is easy for us to expound our
                        position on that because we have done so on many occasions in the past. But
                        there are two questions which should be raised. First is something the
                        American side should say which would be of a decisive nature for
                        normalization of relations between China and the United States. In our
                        present exchange of views I raised a new question on this matter, that is to
                        say, on the international arena there have already appeared activities aimed
                        at creating an independent Taiwan. I have discussed it with you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, Mr. Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And so the matter of crucial
                        importance is for the U.S. to indicate it will not carry out or support any
                        activities aimed at separating Taiwan from China. And then as you said, you
                        would state that, “the United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either
                        side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China.” You should also
                        say that the United States would encourage the Chinese to solve this
                        internal matter by themselves through peaceful negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are saying almost
                        that.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="d51-23" facs="d51-23"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If it is not solved, there is no
                        possibility of normalization of relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We say that the United
                        States “takes note of that position and will support efforts to reach an
                        equitable and peaceful resolution of the ultimate relationship of Taiwan to
                        the mainland.” We can strengthen “takes note of.” These two sentences
                        support each other.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But if you do not make clear
                        that you will not carry out or support any activities separating Taiwan from
                        China, then one can have two interpretations of this sentence—“support
                        efforts to reach an equitable and peaceful resolution of the ultimate
                        relationship of Taiwan to the mainland.” This could be interpreted as Taiwan
                        being returned to the Motherland or separated from China. Because if you do
                        not say what you are opposed to, you cannot guarantee the return of Taiwan
                        to the Motherland.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have the problem of
                        what I told the Prime Minister. What I have said to him is our policy on
                        which he can rely, no matter what the communique says. So he can rely on the
                        fact that we will not support an independent Taiwan. I am certain that the
                        President will repeat this to the Prime Minister and, of course, to the
                        Chairman.</p>
                    <p>The second question therefore is the question of the communique, which is not
                        so much relevant for our policy but for public impression. Now we have
                        attempted to draft this in such a way—in English these two sentences have a
                        tendency to support each other. But we could perhaps strengthen the second
                        section by instead of saying “takes note of that position”, saying “does not
                        challenge that position.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's one question of
                        wording.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It makes clear that we
                        are not opposing it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then the second question is
                        that of the withdrawal of armed forces and military installations from
                        Taiwan. It's better for you to say it and not us. After you have completed
                        your withdrawal from Indochina, you will withdraw all forces from Taiwan. If
                        this is not said about your withdrawal, the impression among the Chinese
                        people and the people of the world will be that the United States has
                        invaded Chinese territory.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="d51-24" facs="d51-24"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me first make clear
                        that the Prime Minister understands what we said we would do so that he does
                        not misinterpret our intention, and then we will go to the communique.</p>
                    <p>What I have told him is that in a reasonable period of time after the
                        completion of the war in Indochina, we will withdraw that part of our force
                        in Taiwan that was put there because of the war in Indochina, which is
                        roughly two-thirds of the force on Taiwan. The remainder, which is in any
                        event not a combat force, would be progressively reduced over a longer
                        period of time. This is the understanding I think I have with the Prime
                        Minister and before we get into words I want to make sure we understand each
                        other correctly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But this understanding should
                        find expression in the communique too, not in such specific terms but in
                        principle that all armed forces and military establishments should be
                        withdrawn from Taiwan. Because if that is not mentioned in the joint
                        communique, then people will become skeptical about normalization because
                        how could there be normalization then? If the Chinese side put that forward
                        as a demand and the U.S. side makes no reply, that's even worse, or if we
                        put it forward and you do reply it would not be as good as if you put it
                        forward on your own initiative. If this question is avoided altogether, then
                        the broad masses of the people of the world would wonder what question has
                        been solved after all.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have two public
                        opinions to consider next year. Yours, but in 1972—we will be frank with the
                        Prime Minister—the only broad masses of the people of concern to the
                        President has to be the American people. I am frank. Therefore it is
                        difficult to be as explicit as you have in mind, though I repeat we will
                        honor our commitment in action.</p>
                    <p>But let me see, Mr. Prime Minister, whether I can find a formulation that,
                        without being as precise as our conversations, indicates a direction we
                        intend to go. And maybe if we can meet again, go through other points, and I
                        could submit it to you this afternoon for discussion, or if we take a break,
                        after some time I will try to find a formulation that says something about
                        U.S. military forces on Taiwan and the direction we want to go. I can see
                        your point that without reference there might be some difficulty.</p>
                    <p>PM. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="d51-25" facs="d51-25"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would have to show it
                        to the President, of course, but I will write out two or three
                        sentences.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because if we raise this
                        question and you give no reply it would be a very bad impression.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You admit we are exercising
                        great restraint on the matter of Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Very much so, and I
                        admire it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And what is more, we are
                        agreeing that for the sake of normalization of relations between the two
                        countries, we are not demanding an immediate solution for this in all
                        aspects but that it be solved step by step. And so from this point alone it
                        can be shown that in solving this crucial matter we do not proceed in undue
                        haste.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I recognize this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And so having exchanged some
                        preliminary views we can study whether it is possible before you leave this
                        time, whether it is possible to arrive at some preliminary common views.
                        Today, being the last day of your visit, it is bound to be busy. It is
                        always the case.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we had stayed three
                        days longer, it would be the same.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Have lunch now and a short
                        rest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Shall we meet again
                        this afternoon?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. Since I came personally I
                        could not separate myself from this job. Since I have already joined this
                        endeavor I am tying myself on this. I had wanted to escape from it today,
                        but it appears not possible. If we can arrive at some results this time, it
                        will save endeavors next time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we get jammed today
                        we can put off our departure a few hours in the morning. That is not
                        crucial. We can decide later this afternoon.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will continue with the
                        discussion we had this morning.</p>
                    <p>Now we would like to put forward a very tentative and unofficial draft for
                        the joint communique. It is mainly drafted by our side, with the exception
                        of some similarities in the beginning. Most of it is an exposition of our
                        point of view, also putting in some possible common points of view and also
                        some of your points of view, and in other places we left it blank to put in
                        your point of view. So we can only say to you it is not official, and is a
                        tentative draft.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So, we will just read it out,
                        through translation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is there an English
                        text you will be able to give us after it is read to us?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I will come to that. If Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> considers that this
                        draft <pb n="2" xml:id="d52-02" facs="d52-02"/>may be used for your study
                        and you find that you need it, then we will give it to you. Because in this
                        way, then, we express in a freer way our views. Please forgive me if I ask
                        the Acting Foreign Minister to read it out, with the interpreter giving the
                        translation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Thank you for giving me time for
                        rest, like the opportunity which your President gave you when listening to
                        the Emperor of Ethiopia. [laughter] I tried my best to say as few words as
                        possible, but yet I couldn't do it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You mean in the
                        morning.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I find our discussions
                        really very useful, and I wish we had even more time.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (after second
                        paragraph): When you say “two sides,” you mean Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. Grammatically speaking,
                        that probably has to be put in there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: A slight change. I just
                        wanted to understand what you were including here.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: (after last full paragraph on page one): We will just translate
                        paragraph by paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (during first paragraph
                        of page three): He (indicating the Acting Foreign Minister, who kept trying
                        to resume the reading in Chinese before the interpreter had finished
                        speaking) is terribly eager. Did he draft it? [laughter]</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (during first paragraph
                        of page four): What do you mean by “region"?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is those who are in
                        Indochina. When we say “region of Indochina,” it just means the three
                        countries of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Does this include the
                        Chinese troops building a road in northern Laos?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is foreign troops. But they
                        are engineering corps. They will, of course, withdraw. They are considered
                        to be foreign troops, but they are engineering corps, and not combat troops.
                        But, of course, they are foreign troops.</p>
                    <p>(After full text has been read by <persName>Chi</persName> and translated):
                        That's all.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Could we perhaps make
                        some preliminary comments, or would the Prime Minister perhaps like to add
                        something?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No, please.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Would it be possible
                        for me to have a copy so I can refer to certain phrases?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will give it to you later,
                        because it's being retyped now. It's just being rushed out; it's rather
                        incomplete. It's being retyped now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, then I have
                        to do it from memory. Let me deal with it in two parts, first with the basic
                        concept and secondly with the execution of the concept.</p>
                    <p>I thought this afternoon a great deal about our discussion this morning. And
                        I came to the conclusion that there is much merit in the Prime Minister's
                        point of view that it would be better for both sides to state their views
                        plainly and thereby produce perhaps a somewhat unusual communique which
                        reflects the unusual nature of our relationship. So the basic idea that the
                        Prime Minister put forward, that the communique take the form of each side's
                        stating its position and then both sides stating their common positions is a
                        good one, and one, I believe, acceptable to us. I will have to discuss it
                        with the President, but this I am fairly sure about. <pb n="4" xml:id="d52-04" facs="d52-04"/>Now we come to two questions: one, how is
                        this to be actually carried out, and secondly, what topics are to be
                        covered? Let me take the second point first for the consideration of the
                        Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister has now a long list of a number of countries on which our
                        views are stated, which tends to negate the general principle that we are
                        not negotiating about third countries. Also, we don't want to offend any of
                        your neighbors by leaving them out. [<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs]</p>
                    <p>Seriously, the problem is that if we list some countries and not others it
                        raises questions, and if we list all countries, it raises questions about
                        what we are doing discussing so many third countries.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me turn to the substance as I remember it. I think the general point
                        that I have made is supported by the fact that in the discussion of basic
                        principles, the formulations that you have are not far from what we can
                        accept, with, however, one proviso. Throughout all of this, the Chinese
                        position is stated in its most intransigent terms. Now we recognize your
                        necessities, both domestic and international, but we have our own
                        necessities, both domestic and international. And we have to answer the
                        question of why we came all the way to Peking to listen again to what we can
                        read in the Chinese newspapers and what we have already heard in the many
                        interviews the Prime Minister has given.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we are not asking you to change your views, but it must be
                        possible to find more moderate formulations. And you have to understand that
                        certain words have a different significance in America than they have here.
                        I told you this morning that we are opposed to racial discrimination, but we
                        cannot accept any phraseology that implies that we permitted a discussion of
                        American domestic problems while we were in Peking. But I believe, if I had
                        the text, that I could make suggestions whereby by the deletion of maybe two
                        sentences the first part would be quite acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me turn to Vietnam. I frankly do not see how it can make any sense
                        for the People's Republic to support a seven-point program which Hanoi has
                        told us privately it does not want us to negotiate. And if we make public
                        the secret negotiations we will both look ridiculous. On three different
                        occasions Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> told me, and
                        I have the stenographic record, that we should discuss the nine points and
                        not the seven points, and we have replied twice to the nine points. So, if
                        you want to support points which your own ally is not supporting, that is
                        your privilege, <pb n="5" xml:id="d52-05" facs="d52-05"/>but it will make
                        neither of us look very good.</p>
                    <p>But this is an editing problem, because no doubt you can find words to
                        support the position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam without referring
                        to something they have themselves rejected in private talks. And if you want
                        to maintain this phraseology now, knowing what the record enables us to make
                        public, I will not object.</p>
                    <p>But, on the other hand, there are certain phrases which would be very
                        offensive to the American public. When you call yourself “the reliable rear
                        area of the just war,” or whatever the phrase is, you are saying no more
                        than what I have read for years in your newspapers. So this is in no way
                        surprising.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, you have to understand that the American public has
                        suffered a great deal in this war, and that the mothers of the soldiers who
                        were killed there, and of the prisoners who are held there, will ask
                        themselves why the President had to go 12,000 miles to be told all these
                        things.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the eight-point program about Korea, I have already stated
                        our views with respect to both its grammar and it use of adjectives. And
                        therefore the objective tendency of this formulation is to sharpen
                        differences, when in fact our positions are beginning to approach each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Japan, I do not see the People's Republic standing to make
                        any comment about Okinawa, since this is a subject that concerns us and
                        Japan—I mean in a document that is supposed to be signed by the President of
                        the United States; of course, you are free to make any comment in your own
                        statements.</p>
                    <p>And on the general points about Japan, we have had a full discussion, and the
                        Prime Minister knows our views, But if he maintains that the People's
                        Republic must state these views, we must state views that are so contrary
                        that again it raises questions about what the purpose of the visit was.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Indian subcontinent, I believe that the phraseology, with
                        the deletion of perhaps one sentence, is essentially acceptable. I would
                        therefore like to put to the Prime Minister … oh, Taiwan.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d52-06" facs="d52-06"/>
                    <p>I believe also that the formulations with respect to Taiwan go further than
                        it would be possible for us to say on this visit. I have told the Prime
                        Minister exactly what can be expected from us, and I have told him that we
                        would be prepared to extend some of the formulations we submitted to you.
                        But we cannot go so far as you have proposed. Perhaps the best way to
                        proceed would be for me, or for us, to draft tonight something that is
                        possible and show it to you tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Especially on Taiwan?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>So what I would like to propose to the Prime Minister is the following. The
                        basic approach, despite all my criticisms, is, I think, a useful one. But I
                        believe that if this communique were published in this form, the impact on
                        the United States would be exactly the opposite of what you intend. All of
                        those who have sought improved relations with the People's Republic will be
                        discredited because it will be said the President came 12,000 miles in order
                        to be asked to sign a document containing the sharpest possible formulations
                        against United States policy. There must be some way of expressing your
                        principles which also maintains the self-respect of the American leaders.
                        This problem is less acute in the section on general principles in which
                        there are only two or three sentences that could be considered offensive,
                        but it is acute in the specifics.</p>
                    <p>One other point, and I have to do all this from memory, it isn't possible to
                        refer to understandings in a public communique—we will be spending the next
                        two years explaining what the understandings were. With respect to our
                        understandings, you have to rely on us to be far-sighted. It is not in our
                        interest to try to trick you, and if we try to trick you, you will find it
                        out very quickly, and everything we are trying to do will be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>We do not have to settle our differences; indeed we cannot on this visit, or
                        maybe ever. But we do have to indicate that the visit marked some
                        significant new beginning, or why else is it taking place? We must be able
                        to answer the question of exactly what was accomplished, and what was
                        accomplished cannot be only things that we must do in response to Chinese
                        demands. There are many forces on the right, and curiously enough also on
                        the pro-Soviet left and the pro-India liberal side, who would like nothing
                        better than if this visit can end without any tangible progress either in
                        mood or in content.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d52-07" facs="d52-07"/>
                    <p>So I would say that I agree with the method of the Prime Minister; I think
                        that the first section is approaching what can be said, but the remainder of
                        the document needs reconsideration as to content, not so much as to
                        method.</p>
                    <p>That is all I have to say, and the Prime Minister will forgive me that I did
                        it from memory and without the document, and I may have been unjust in my
                        quotations here and there.</p>
                    <p>There is one slight ambiguity which is unintended, which I want to call to
                        the attention of the Prime Minister. At one point he says China has no
                        intention of becoming a superpower. At another point he says no major
                        country should collude with another against a third. So unless the Prime
                        Minister is making a distinction between a superpower and a major power,
                        this would leave China free to collude with another country against a third.
                        I just wanted to point out the possibility.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We do differentiate between
                        “superpower” and “major power.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's a minor point.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You see, we use “major power”
                        incorrectly. It should say “big country.” It means big in size and
                        population.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your
                        thought, but it is something someone reading it would pick up. It's a pure
                        drafting problem, and I understand you. We have no problem between us.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The translation is incorrect. It
                        shows how interpreters influence international events.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The other points I
                        raised are serious.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I will not be in haste to reply
                        to the other questions. I would like to express my true views. This morning
                        I raised the question of Taiwan. On the question of Taiwan we put it in a
                        most restrained manner. And it is great restraint, whether from the point of
                        view of our propaganda or the demands of our people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't object to your
                        statement about your position. I believe it would be counterproductive to
                        state our position in the form in which you stated it.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d52-08" facs="d52-08"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But you must express these
                        questions in some way.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, on this we made use
                        of one of your formulations in acknowledging that “all Chinese on either
                        side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China.” That's one
                        point of view.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we will put it this way, that is the United States will encourage
                        the Chinese to settle this internal question by themselves, through peaceful
                        negotiations. This is what you have said all along, and your side expressed
                        a willingness to do this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The word “internal”
                        will give us trouble at this stage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then international? No, we
                        couldn't accept that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course not. That's
                        why we don't think … If we now say “internal” it will raise numerous
                        questions. We will then be asked to say why you said “internal.” We will say
                        we recognize the government in Taipei and it will get us into an
                        interminable argument. The things that should matter to you are what I have
                        said, and that the President will repeat. These are the measures that will
                        guide our policy. What is in a communique is in itself only symbolic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But these four points which we
                        had formulated on the Taiwan question are crucial points, and if these are
                        not indicated, then we will not know to what date in the distant future the
                        promotion of the normalization of relations will be extended. We didn't
                        mention the third point we wanted to express, that is you will not carry out
                        or support any activities aimed at separating Taiwan from China and will not
                        support two China formulas and so on, and the fourth point, the withdrawal
                        of troops.</p>
                    <p>Actually, these measures, as we discussed, must go through a series of steps.
                        But the United States side is bound to express its position on these
                        matters. Otherwise, neither the Chinese people nor people of the world would
                        know how our two countries will have relations, along what track we will
                        proceed. You said this morning you want to find some formulation to express
                        that.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand that, but
                        I have also told the Prime Minister two things: first, it's possible for us
                        to do more than we can say, and secondly, it's possible for us to take more
                        measures after next ye ar than during next year. I have made both of these
                        points to the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, that has been said between
                        our two sides already, and when the President comes he will, of course,
                        reaffirm that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He will reaffirm
                        everything that I have said.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is the position you had
                        already told us. But if this is not indicated in some form in the
                        communique, then the people of our countries as well as the people of the
                        world, will not know what is our orientation, what is the direction of our
                        efforts. They will wonder why there is a normalization of relations, on what
                        basis normalization will be established.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But you have said in
                        your document what the requirements for normalization are.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So lack of clarity is
                        not one of the problems of this document; exactly the opposite.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: [laughs] Generally speaking, you
                        don't resort to diplomatic language, but here you are using diplomatic
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is true, and I
                        have told you exactly why. What I would like to do on Taiwan—I don't object
                        to your definition of your side. Let me draft tonight something for our side
                        which includes a point about the military question, and show it to you in
                        the morning. I understand your point about your principle, and I will go as
                        far as I believe it is possible to go.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, you are bound to
                        withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits. It's a question of time. We are
                        not asking you to immediately withdraw, although we have the right to make
                        such a demand, but we are not making it precisely because we understand the
                        normalization of relations requires a process.</p>
                    <p>But there is this question which I raised this time, and you look upon as
                        new: that is the question of Taiwan being undetermined so-called. On this
                        question the United States must find some way of expressing its view. that
                        you will not bring about a separation of Taiwan from China. We are not
                        asking for you to undertake to stop all of your activities, because even if
                        you did so, it may not succeed. We won't blame you for that. We just ask you
                        not to support these activities.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have already given
                        the Prime Minister assurances on that. There are two questions. The first is
                        what can we say now about things we have discussed, and I believe we can say
                        something to indicate a direction, but we cannot say everything we have
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>The second point, which is perhaps insoluble, is that the average American,
                        if he reads this document is going to ask why. The average American, not
                        Huey Newton, or some who come through here, will find a whole list of
                        propositions that will to him appear extraordinarily critical of the United
                        States. With respect to which we are making a whole series of concessions,
                        and he will ask why. What is it that has changed to make us give up long
                        established position? <pb n="11" xml:id="d52-11" facs="d52-11"/>I am not
                        speaking of Taiwan above. If it were alone with general principles, that
                        would be different. But if there is a whole list of other countries in the
                        world and on top of that Taiwan, …</p>

                        Standing alone this is different. I am not saying this only about Taiwan,
                        but about the whole tone of the document which then ends with Taiwan. All
                        that comes out in a slightly positive nature is that American
                        representatives can come to Peking on an irregular basis, which is I am sure
                        a pleasant thing for them, but is not reciprocal.</p>
                    <p>I am certain that if we sign this document we would find ourselves in the
                        curious position that our own political opponents would accuse us of being
                        soft on Communism, which would be an odd event for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>. And this time I don't mean
                        on the right. I am not speaking about Taiwan; Taiwan is the one that's
                        easiest to fix in this document. The basic principles of Taiwan I think we
                        can fix fairly easily. On other points together with Taiwan, it becomes very
                        tough.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, on the question of Taiwan,
                        you should think about a way to express yourself on these four points.
                        Otherwise, it will be very difficult to make an accounting to our
                        people.</p>
                    <p>As for your views on the other points, after you have seen our draft in
                        writing, then you can put forward your views. But you should try to find
                        some formulation to express these four points concerning Taiwan, and it may
                        be possible your formulation would be even better than ours. For instance,
                        your formulation that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits
                        maintain there is but one China,” that is something you thought out. We
                        could not have thought that out.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think between 2:00
                        and 3:00 in the morning you probably could have.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Indeed, I admire you for
                        thinking out such a formulation. (Miss T'ang says something in Chinese.
                        )</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: She claims she thought
                        that one up?</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: She says they copyrighted that, not from us …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But from whom?</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: First of all, the Premier says he cannot claim the copyright on
                        such, nor could Miss T'ang.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How should we proceed

                        rest now, at least for your two assistants. Otherwise the calories we have

                        reconsider some of the formulations that we have discussed?</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't mean Taiwan. I
                        have given you a list of things I objected to.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will study them. Principally
                        we would like to hear your views first.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My question was what is
                        our work plan then for tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s Interpreter: At 9:00 the
                        Premier will come to your guest house, and the same people, too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. This is a
                        rather long communique. How much time can the Prime Minister give to this
                        problem tomorrow? I want to know so that I can set the departure of the
                        plane.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's only an initial, tentative
                        draft. And so long as your views approach each other, then a further
                        exchange can be done either through your sending another special envoy to
                        Peking, or through Paris, or some other means. Because, as I had said to you
                        before, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> also considered
                        that if it is not possible to agree on a communique, then we might consider
                        not issuing any communique at all. But that might not be so good for your
                        President after he has come and visited China, and yet no results are
                        announced. But we had thought about that possibility. So, what we should do
                        at this time is try to reach a general agreement on a tentative draft, and
                        then we must see how events develop. Some points we may be able to
                        affirm.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This could take us the
                        better part of tomorrow.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. At least three
                        hours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Probably more. Shall we
                        set the departure for 5:00?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. You mean leave Peking at
                        5:00?</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or maybe 6:00?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Maybe 5:00 would be all right.
                        Or 6:00.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's say 5:00 and we
                        can put it off an hour if it is necessary.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it is very
                        important to get an outline. It is very difficult to send a special envoy
                        here who knows enough about our discussions to talk to you intelligently. Of
                        course, I could meet somebody in Paris or elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It will be best if we can arrive
                        at some outline at this time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: On the main points.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Once we have an
                        outline, then we can exchange drafts.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right. Then we can have
                        an exchange through our channels, because there will bound to be some
                        considerations on the wording. And when your President comes, you can still
                        discuss this then.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but I have the
                        impression that the Prime Minister will be somewhat occupied.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I will find some time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And also, now my deputy
                        is taking care of the President, but when the President is here, I must take
                        care, of his business, too.</p>
                    <p>But I think we understand each other, and I think you understand what my
                        problems are with this draft. And we will take a look at it, and perhaps you
                        can take a look at it also.</p>
                    <p>But you have said you still have two matters.</p>

                        Paris. We probably prefer it before the 24th, because the President will go
                        away. It's no big problem.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. The time will
                        always be 1600 Washington time. All right. So we will propose a date to you
                        within the next few days, within a week.</p>
                    <p>I have one technical matter. Our technical people are under the impression
                        that you have agreed that a technical group may visit China after this

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It took longer to draft
                        than we thought (referring to revising the draft communique). We just
                        finished an hour ago.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No sleep?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We did it in shifts. He
                        (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>) worked last night and I got
                        up this morning at 6:00. How should we proceed, Mr. Prime Minister?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I will first listen to you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, we
                        redrafted your tentative draft that you presented to us yesterday. Let me
                        tell you what we attempted to do before I read it. <pb n="2" xml:id="d53-02" facs="d53-02"/>We recognize that it would not be worthy for either of
                        our countries to write a communique with the usual banalities. We also think
                        that it would be better, as the Prime Minister suggested, that each side
                        states its position plus the things it agrees on.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, since we are at the beginning of what we hope will be a
                        move toward friendship, it is important that the public does not get the
                        impression that all the leaders did was to repeat standard positions and use
                        this as a platform to say standard things to each other. So we have tried to
                        reduce somewhat those passages that we found objectionable as I explained to
                        you last night.</p>
                    <p>On Taiwan, we have redrafted the section which you saw in our draft and
                        attempted to take into account some of the points the Prime Minister made to
                        us last night or in slightly elliptical language. So let me read our
                        proposed tentative draft. Is that agreeable?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (Reads second U.S.
                        draft at Tab A.)</p>
                    <p>(After first paragraph.) Actually it's your first page. I would be glad to
                        read it, but it is your first page. The same technical part. Do you want me
                        to read it? I would be glad to.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Who was at meetings and
                        what was visited.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly as you had it
                        last night.</p>
                    <p>(Referring to first paragraph on page two.) We took out “great turmoil
                        exists”, but I will not man the barricades on that phrase.</p>
                    <p>(Referring to paragraph starting on page two and ending on page three.) I am
                        sure this can be shortened a little, this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>(Referring to third subparagraph of first full paragraph of page four.) That
                        repeats something we have already said.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d53-03" facs="d53-03"/>
                    <p>(Referring to last sentence of second full paragraph on page seven.) If we
                        agree on this it will be the first time that the State Department spokesman
                        of the President will be disputed in the press. I am accepting it. I just
                        want to pay tribute to the diplomatic skill of the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We did not think about that at
                        all because you said it would no longer be repeated.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will read the
                        American position and then I will explain it. (Referring to sentence that
                        begins on page seven and ends on page eight.) This is a change in your
                        draft. Before we said we “took note of it;” now we say we “no longer
                        challenge it.”</p>
                    <p>(Referring to second full sentence on page eight.) Since we have said earlier
                        that tensions are related to Indochina I think it is clear what we mean.</p>
                    <p>PM Chow: (Referring to third full sentence on page eight.) Abandon your
                        concern for interest, profits? You mean a concern for a peaceful
                        solution?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Will you please repeat?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “This would be done
                        without the abandonment of United States interest in a peaceful solution.”
                        It has nothing to do with interest. If the word “interest” bothers you, we
                        can change it. We want no ambiguity. That is a drafting problem.</p>
                    <p>(Referring to second full paragraph on page eight.) This is later than in
                        your draft.</p>
                    <p>(Referring to last full sentence on page eight.) My secretary was so moved by
                        this sentence she typed it twice. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: (Referring to the second to last
                        paragraph. ) You changed that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So it ends on a
                        positive note. (Rereads the paragraph.) (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> hands over the draft to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>.) We have attempted, Mr. Prime
                        Minister, to draft a communique that takes into account the necessities of
                        both sides. I believe that it would be a very <pb n="4" xml:id="d53-04" facs="d53-04"/>unusual communique if we could agree to it. It would be
                        more honest and more honorable than any other communique that I have seen in
                        the relations between two countries. It states our differences without being
                        offensive, and it tries to state a positive direction without raising false
                        hopes. And, therefore, it could begin a new historical period, not only in
                        the relations of our peoples but the peoples of the world.</p>
                    <p>But I am sure that the Prime Minister will have suggestions to make further
                        improvements.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I hope so. So I won't say so
                        much at the present moment. You spent a whole night working on it. I hope
                        that you will give us time now to translate it and make a study of it. And
                        we will try to give a reply to you two to three hours hence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. About the
                        departure, so that we are not under pressure, we could leave—it is up to
                        you—as late as 9:00 tomorrow morning and arrive in Washington at 4:00 the
                        next day which is about what we are planning to do. It is a little hard on
                        the crew but for once, for an important occasion. If you would like that, we
                        would be prepared —</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We agree. I shall see that they
                        have a good rest tonight. First of all, they should have a good afternoon
                        nap and a film to relax them, and then an early sleep. If it is possible,
                        could you give us another copy? (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> gives the Chinese another copy.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. And set the
                        departure for 9:00 tomorrow morning.</p>

                        Did you type (last night) Miss Matthews?</p>
                    <p>Miss Matthews: No, Miss Pineau did.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I notice that on the
                        last day the Chinese side always disappears and returns at irregular
                        intervals.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn't have an
                        opportunity to thank you this morning, Mr. Prime Minister, for arranging for
                        the showing of the film of our visit in July. It brought back very pleasant
                        memories, and in addition I thought it was very well done.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It was quite short, however.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It was short, but I
                        thought very well done. The background music was nice and the pictures were
                        well selected.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This time they probably took
                        more shots.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d54-02" facs="d54-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would think so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You went to the Altar of Heaven
                        today, and took a walk there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right. It is
                        very impressive.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Prime Minister, we have had only two hours to look over your document and
                        therefore our reactions are not as detailed as they should be. (Second
                        Chinese draft is attached at Tab A.) I understand what you attempted to do
                        in this document. You attempted to put all the positions of each side
                        together at the beginning of the document, and then to state the other
                        material afterwards. The practical result: of this is that of an eight page
                        document; one page deals with technical aspects, four pages deal with
                        disagreement stated in rather strong terms, and only two can be said to have
                        any constructive aspects. I am talking about the English version, of
                        course.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There seems to be quite a
                        difference in pages between English and Chinese. The Chinese in our typed
                        text is five and a half pages, but when it is printed in official documents
                        it is four pages.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But the proportion will
                        not change.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Not necessarily, because the
                        first page will still be filled with protocol aspects because the names are
                        not in it yet; that will take one page in Chinese. Then the views of each
                        side take up less than two and a half pages, and then common views take one
                        page. Then there is the Taiwan question, and the final part is about the
                        resolution of problems. So in our version out of five and a half pages, two
                        and a half deal with disagreements. Probably in the Chinese the ideas are
                        expressed in a more concentrated way and in English it takes more words.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My problem is that the
                        President will read the English version.</p>
                    <p>Let me make a philosophical comment, before I make specific comments. Ever
                        since this Administration has come into office the President and I have
                        attempted to start a new direction toward the People's Republic. And this is
                        why for us the visit in China marked in many respects the high point of what
                        we have attempted to do in our foreign policy. We started this when
                        improving relations with the People's Republic of China was not at all a
                        popular course.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d54-03" facs="d54-03"/>
                    <p>Now what fills me with some melancholy is the impression I have that for your
                        own reasons you are under necessity to state our disagreements in the
                        sharpest and most provocative way possible. All the drafts we have submitted
                        have attempted to emphasize areas of agreement. Now I understand the
                        pressures and the convictions that push you into an opposite direction. You
                        did not go through what you have done for 50 years in order to alter your
                        beliefs in anticipation of a President's visit. But we have an important
                        decision to make, and the decision is whether we are starting a new period
                        or engaging in a tactic in a struggle. I am speaking with great frankness.
                        We are trying to begin a new era.</p>
                    <p>Now, for example, to ask the President of the United States to sign a
                        document with the first sentence of the first substantive paragraph saying
                        people of the world want to make revolution is rather strong medicine.
                        Similarly, I have explained to the Prime Minister previously that. we did
                        not start the war in Vietnam—that is, this Administration did not start it,
                        and we are trying to end it. Indeed, we are hoping it will perhaps be ended
                        by the time the President comes here. But for him to be asked to sign, if
                        the war should go on, the Chinese determination to help to the end the
                        struggle of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia where American soldiers are being
                        killed is rather painful. We are not asking you not to support them, and the
                        Prime Minister knows that we have asked nothing with respect to Vietnam and
                        will take no advantage in any respect in our negotiations towards Vietnam.
                        But the President will have to answer to the American people. So we are not
                        trying to affect your actions. I am speaking now of your words. I could give
                        other examples. We are not challenging your views; we are just challenging
                        your expression.</p>
                    <p>So now a word about Taiwan. I am clear about what our understanding is. And
                        we have repeated it on many occasions to the Prime Minister, and I am
                        certain the President will repeat it when he is here. But I also told the
                        Prime Minister at our first meeting that we could do more than we can say.
                        The formulation which I have given the Prime Minister, while it doesn't go
                        as far as he wishes me to go, goes far beyond what any other American
                        administration could even have conceived. I don't mind telling him that I
                        have gone beyond my instructions in offering the formulation of not
                        challenging their views, and in respect to military measures we will take.
                        And it may be that I can convince the President that some of the proposals
                        of the Prime Minister on the issues of Taiwan are acceptable. I am not
                        optimistic on that score. I think I can convince him of what I have proposed
                        here.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d54-04" facs="d54-04"/>
                    <p>But I do want to repeat to the Prime Minister what I have said on at least
                        three occasions before. One, within a reasonable period of time after the
                        end of the Vietnam war, we will withdraw that part of our force on Taiwan
                        which is related to the war in Vietnam, which is about 2/3 of the force on
                        Taiwan. After that withdrawal is completed we will continue the withdrawal.
                        And we will do nothing to encourage a separate Taiwan movement. So that the
                        one sentence that the Prime Minister wants to put into the communique is
                        agreeable in substance but would be self-defeating if it is stated in
                        writing now.</p>
                    <p>I am afraid that if we accepted this draft we would be condemned in America
                        for accepting a rather extreme formulation of the Chinese position, and in
                        return we will have withdrawn all forces on Taiwan and been permitted to
                        sign the five principles for coexistence which have been on the table for
                        sixteen years.</p>
                    <p>What we have done in the limited time available is to take your document and
                        take out those sentences we find most offensive. And we have restored one or
                        two sentences which are of some symbolic significance in the U.S. but have
                        no enormous operational consequence, such as the phrase that both sides have
                        a responsibility to reduce the danger of military conflict. This should not
                        be too painful for you.</p>
                    <p>On Taiwan, I believe that I will have trouble enough convincing the President
                        of the formulation I have given you, but nevertheless I am prepared to go to
                        the President, especially on the sentence about a separatist movement, to
                        see whether we can find a formulation that meets your needs. I don't want to
                        hold out much hope to you and I'm not sure it's necessary, because I think
                        our understanding should mean more to you than the statement and the
                        statement is very definite.</p>
                    <p>In practice this means that we have accepted 85 percent of your draft. (Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asks Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> to hand over a copy of the long version
                        of the two alternate drafts that had been prepared. This third U. S. draft
                        is attached at Tab B.) I don't know if I should inflict a reading of this on
                        the Prime Minister at this hour.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One that I forgot to
                        tell you has to do with the psychology of the President. He wants to be in a
                        position where he is working every part of the day and not just
                        sightseeing.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So that was added.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So I added the phrase
                        that he continued his discussions (referring to last paragraph on page one).
                        I am assuming that by the time you are travelling together you will be still
                        speaking. (laughter) So it was true. I won't explain the changes. They are

                        significance of the phrase “both wish to reduce the danger of military
                        conflict” (referring to second paragraph of page five). I am not clear. Is
                        it that the two sides should be careful of violations of borders or air
                        violations?</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d54-06" facs="d54-06"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Both sides should
                        exercise restraint in relations so as to lessen the danger of bilateral
                        conflict, and where they have a common interest, to reduce the danger of
                        conflict elsewhere. It is really another version of the statement not to use
                        force or the threat of force.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is already included in the
                        principle mentioned above, following the five principles of coexistence.
                        That is, disputes should be settled on this basis without using force. That
                        is a principle, but here you mentioned the two sides.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a more active
                        form that they should show restraint in actions with each other, including
                        the point the Prime Minister used.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, the places where there is
                        contact between the two sides, one is the Taiwan Straits, one is our border
                        with Indochina, another is from the air; and then another possibility will
                        be Korea and there is an armistice agreement there already and it is a
                        question of turning it into a more permanent arrangement. I notice that you
                        took out the sentence from our former draft that we would try to find a more
                        permanent arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's see what else
                        there is in the draft. I don't think this sentence will break up
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's true. I just want to make
                        sure what you have in mind here because originally I was thinking of leaving
                        it as it was.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What I have in mind is
                        that we have an interest to show restraint towards each other, and where we
                        can do some influencing to try to lessen the dangers of conflict—such as in
                        the Asian subcontinent.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said while discussing the Taiwan question a while
                        ago, something about a formulation on the separation of Taiwan. It is not
                        here in the draft.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I haven't found it yet.
                        I would like to discuss it with the President first, and if I find one, I
                        will send it through our usual channel. But what is more important is to
                        have our promise that we will not do it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would like to say why we made
                        those changes, and it was somewhat difficult, from last night. Last night
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that you were for
                        drafting so that each side states its position; and then state the common
                        ground on which each side is found, that is, in order to show that our two
                        sides are taking a positive approach in pushing things forward.</p>
                    <p>And Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that there
                        appeared to be some ambiguity: while both sides said they would not
                        negotiate on behalf of any third party there are common points on certain
                        questions. That is why after studying those points in common there does
                        appear to be a contradiction.</p>
                    <p>For instance, the Indochinese question. In our repeated public utterances we
                        have always said when we talk about forces withdrawing from Indochina we
                        talk about the people from outside; and let the three peoples of Indochina
                        settle their problems for themselves. But in your formulation which you
                        handed over to us you mentioned all foreign troops should withdraw from each
                        country, and that the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia should settle
                        their problems for themselves free from foreign interference. And as Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said yesterday, we
                        should proceed from a practical approach. That is, only on those points on
                        which we are really in agreement should we say so. If it appears we are, but
                        in reality we aren't, then we cannot really explain ourselves; and if a
                        third country asks about it, it will be a dishonest communique because we
                        cannot explain it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought about it, and
                        it does give the impression that the People's Republic and the United States
                        are trying to exercise a sort of condominium and settle these issues. This
                        is true even where we agree, like on the Indian subcontinent where we
                        genuinely agree, and on Indochina where we can only make formulations that
                        are dishonest. I understand what you did, and I respect this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And it is true that probably
                        only on the question of the subcontinent are our views more close. But
                        indeed if we are to do so, it will make India feel we are working together
                        to threaten her.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d54-08" facs="d54-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So there are disadvantages for
                        putting our views on the various regions separately.</p>
                    <p>Then again for Japan. It is possible that with regard to Japan's future some
                        of our views are approximate or even are the same, but if we put it together
                        it will be difficult to find common wording. You will persist in honoring
                        your treaty agreement while we must always show opposition to the treaty,
                        and there will be no agreement there. And it is also a similar question with
                        regard to the Korean question. That is why we try to put the propositions of
                        the two sides all together.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand what the
                        Prime Minister is doing, but if he reads over the formulations the practical
                        result is that it concentrates all disagreements into the first two-thirds
                        of the communique, and when I think of the explanation I will have to give
                        to the press, which I will have to do, they will say you came 12,000 miles
                        to do this? But I think we can handle the version we gave you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This method you agree to was of
                        concentrating the views of our two sides. But while doing this it cannot be
                        said that you cannot find any common ground on our two sides expressed in
                        these two concentrated portions. Because otherwise if you cannot find any
                        common ground at all on the general statements in the beginning, you cannot
                        arrive at the end of the communique with regard to the principles of
                        international relations and the four points. This shows that even in general
                        statements in the beginning one can find common points. Otherwise it will
                        not be possible to promote the normalization of the relations of the two
                        countries. So this is not an absolute thing.</p>
                    <p>Then let us cite an example. You delete a lot of our sentences; probably the
                        most serious among these were the words “revolution.” But you mentioned many
                        times yourself about the word “revolution.” You said <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>'s was a revolution, and I didn't
                        want to debate with you. It depends on how one interprets the word
                        “revolution.” But this is a question that can be solved easily. Suppose the
                        word “revolution” be changed to the word “progress.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “and the people want

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In their own countries?
                        I am talking about what we and you say together. We cannot object to what
                        you or your friends say unilaterally.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So that is what I want to say
                        first of all. It is not that we cannot find common ground in the general
                        statements. And then in your general statement you reverted to some of your
                        original formulations; and deleted quite a lot of ours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In our general

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. Of course, you restored the
                        sentence that all foreign troops withdraw to their countries. It is a
                        principle. It's a question of time. And we are not saying at what time. It
                        is a matter of principle.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have put back only
                        one sentence in ours. We have taken out one that you left in in our position
                        and put in one that you took out. If you like that sentence of ours that we

                        those general statements later. What we have is that we found common ground.
                        And in the section on international relations you added that which you had
                        originally (page 4 of U.S. draft, at Tab. A), that is, “countries
                        irrespective of their social systems, have a common interest in working
                        toward a resolution of international differences in the interest of all
                        mankind.” This is a sentence which we should study, to find a proper
                        formulation.</p>

                        guiding both sides (page 5 of U.S. draft), there was three and now there is
                        four, i.e., the one about reducing the danger of military conflict.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The really important question is
                        to say something more on Taiwan because that really affects the relations of
                        our two countries. You know we are not asking you to immediately withdraw
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we understand
                        each other on substance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Substance is one thing, but you
                        must take into account our necessities with our people, just as we have to
                        take into account your necessities. At the same time, you should be aware
                        that negotiations between the Taiwan authorities and the Motherland are not
                        so easy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You didn't say you were
                        conducting them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No, it is not easy. Not only to
                        you but also to some other American friends. That is because we know about
                        the temperament of <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. So
                        it will not be an easy thing to negotiate with the Taiwanese authorities,
                        although you would say have peaceful relations with them. On the one hand it
                        is wished that the Taiwan area will remain tranquil, but at the same time we
                        must not give up our sovereignty over it.</p>
                    <p>On our side we only mentioned principles and did not go into specifics. That
                        is, you expressed that you support efforts to reach an equitable and
                        peaceful resolution of the relationship of Taiwan and the mainland. And then
                        some people might make such an interpretation of this sentence, that is what
                        is meant by equitable, to mean to let the people on Taiwan exercise a
                        plebescite for so-called self-determination.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This attempts to say
                        that all Chinese say there is only one China and the U.S. doesn't challenge
                        that and will support a peaceful resolution of the effort. I think the three
                        sentences point in one direction. Would you prefer if we dropped the word
                        “equitable"?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, it would be

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. I have to tell
                        the Prime Minister that I am operating on my assessment of what the
                        President will accept. But what the President approved was the first draft
                        which we have long since left. I have a <pb n="11" xml:id="d54-11" facs="d54-11"/>rather good estimate of what the President's thinking is,
                        working so closely with him, but I want to be sure that if we change
                        something after we get back that you will not think that I have misled
                        you.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It doesn't matter because
                        between now and the President's visit, it is four months and you can tell
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then with that
                        qualification, let us drop “equitable.” I am quite sure the President will
                        go along with it.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We want to avoid the possibility
                        of guessing on the part of certain people. Because this state of affairs is

                        or one China, two governments. That would be a temporary phenomenon. You

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We know that because we have
                        contact with you, but some other people say this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have next year a
                        particular political problem which I have been candid with you about. We do
                        not want the China lobby to connect together with the radical left and have
                        to fight both simultaneously, and also the pro-Soviet and pro-India
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is easy to deal with the
                        pro-Soviet people because they are revisionists.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not in our domestic
                        affairs, because there is no tradition of dealing with China but there is
                        with the Soviet Union. So Governor Reagan tells you nothing about our
                        foreign policy. He tells you something about our domestic policy.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Your President needed a visit by

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And that is why it
                        would be better next year not to radicalize too many people when the trend
                        is being established.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has talked to Edgar Snow and expounded
                        on that question. First, because your President is in office, so because he
                        is in power, he is able to solve problems. Just to deal with your opposition
                        is to talk empty words, and should they come into office, maybe what they
                        say won't happen at all.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, your President is known as a chieftain of anti-communism, so he
                        dares to do that. So although you may say so much and we may say so much,
                        what counts will be what is done in regard to specific questions.</p>
                    <p>For instance, in talking about principles. One principle is that all foreign
                        troops should be withdrawn back to their own countries. But we know how
                        difficult it is in practice for foreign troops to be withdrawn into their
                        country. The easiest was for China; after the war in Korea, in 1958, all
                        Chinese volunteers withdrew back to China. In fact, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> thought it was done later than it should
                        have been. You mentioned the question of the engineering corps building the
                        road in Laos and the antiaircraft corps. If you solve Indochina through
                        peaceful negotiations, these people of ours will be withdrawn in a day's
                        time. With no war, we don't need antiaircraft defenses, and all we need is
                        our ordinary workers to finish the road.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, it is not
                        self-evident to me why you have engineering troops in another country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is not the engineering corps.
                        Those building the road are workers. We have forces protecting them from air
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But they are building
                        in a foreign country without permission.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No, because that is upon the
                        request of the official administration of the neutralists. We have already
                        built two sections of the highway for them. We will return as soon as we
                        have finished. We do not want to fight there. You cannot find our people
                        engaged in the war there. We have not undertaken that obligation. That we
                        have stated. So it will be very easy for us to withdraw our antiaircraft
                        units.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d54-13" facs="d54-13"/>
                    <p>But it is not so easy to withdraw your forces, and for the Soviet Union it
                        will be even harder. When will they withdraw from Mongolia? Do you know
                        when?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't think ever.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Exactly. The principle is one
                        thing, but putting it into practice takes a long time. But one should set an
                        example. So it really takes time to bring about a <pb n="14" xml:id="d54-14" facs="d54-14"/>relaxation of tension. Then there is the question of
                        Taiwan, that is not separating Taiwan from the motherland.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But it is not easy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If we think about a formulation,
                        would you consider it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course. I would be
                        grateful, particularly if you are elliptical.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The formulation you have here
                        creates a difficulty for us, “progressively reduced.” I think that there are
                        some points of advantage in leaving some so as to not let the Japanese send
                        in their forces.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, while it is in our
                        power. You will know if we are encouraging it, and we will strongly oppose
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The public, when they see this,
                        will think you are not completely withdrawing your forces. So I would like
                        to think about a formulation. We are in no hurry, but the direction should
                        be made clear.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It has for us the
                        advantage of a certain ambiguity which is a disadvantage for you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is right. But in actual
                        practice we are not opposed to your acting like that because so long as you
                        still have forces on Taiwan you will have the responsibility of not letting
                        Japanese armed forces go in. As a sovereign state we cannot publicly say
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But objectively speaking for you
                        to keep forces on Taiwan to prevent Japan from sending its forces into
                        Taiwan is beneficial to the relaxation of tension in the Far East. If Japan
                        puts forces in to bring about a so-called independent Taiwan, that will be
                        the beginning of the end for peace in the Far East. It will be the end of
                        the relaxation of tension. For the Japanese armed forces to bring about a
                        so-called independent Taiwan would be the same as the independence of Outer
                        Mongolia if done by the Soviet Union. That is the seed of unrest in the Far
                        East. We are not afraid to point out the dangers.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will give it no
                        encouragement and we will oppose it, and I am sure the President will repeat
                        this to you and Chairman Mao.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So on this part let us think
                        over what kind of formulation will be best. Of course, we can say only that
                        it will be finalized in February. It's better if we can think of some
                        formulation now than then.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The circumstances of a
                        Presidential trip, the strangeness of the country, and with others along,
                        this will make it harder. In fact, this type of exchange will be difficult.
                        Anything we can settle before the trip would be better.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is one thing. The second
                        thing is that you said you couldn't come again before the President comes.
                        Otherwise they would say why is Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> coming for a third time, and there is obviously a
                        question unsolved. Isn't that the case?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So between now and the
                        President's visit someone else may come as a liaison?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No one sees our
                        protocols, so it is difficult. General Haig knows them, but he is a better
                        soldier than a negotiator. I have complete confidence in him, but this is
                        not his strong point. He would be the best in the interval. Later on,
                        Ambassador Bruce, after Vietnam is no longer a problem for you. But if we
                        send any special envoy now it will attract attention.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's true.</p>
                    <p>We will consider the wording again. It appears we will have to work deeptinto
                        the night tonight. For me, I am accustomed to it, but perhaps your
                        assistants are not.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We, of course, have not
                        had the time to study this (the third Chinese draft attached at Tab A) in
                        all its details, but let me give you a quick reaction. I recognize what you
                        have attempted to do here, and I think it is in a positive direction.</p>
                    <p>I have made two attempts, Mr. Prime Minister. One is to shorten somewhat the
                        statement of our differences for the reasons that I have already given you.
                        And the second is to attempt a redraft of the Taiwan section which, however,
                        puts me into the difficulty that the Prime Minister must understand that I
                        am literally operating on my own. And I do not want to mislead him. I am 95
                        percent sure that I can convince the President of the formulation I gave
                        you. I am less sure of my ability to convince him of what I will discuss
                        with you now, and if under these circumstances the Prime Minister will not
                        discuss it, I will have to stick with the old formulation of the Taiwan
                        issue, just on my new paragraph on Taiwan.</p>

                        authorized to make any changes on the Taiwan formulation, then will you
                        bring back our formulation and ask for the views of the President on that,
                        or ask somebody to come back before the President does with your views, or
                        wait until the President comes?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me do this. Let me
                        show the Prime Minister what I have done here and see what the Prime
                        Minister thinks of this, because I know that your formulation will not be
                        acceptable.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's an attempt to
                        incorporate what I think may have a possibility of being accepted in
                        Washington. Why don't I read it to you?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Let us try.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Shall we do that first
                        before we go to the other part? (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        nods.)</p>
                    <p>“The United States side acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the
                        Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a province
                        of China. (That's your sentence.) The United States Government does not
                        challenge that position. It emphasizes its view that the Chinese people
                        should realize their objective by peaceful negotiation. It will support
                        peaceful efforts to reach a resolution of the problem, and will not use its
                        military presence in the Taiwan Straits to produce additional obstacles to a
                        peaceful solution. The United States accepts the ultimate objective of the
                        withdrawal of its forces from the Taiwan Straits, and pending that will
                        progressively reduce them as tensions diminish.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You mean withdraw its forces
                        from the Taiwan Straits?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, no, from Taiwan.
                        That is the early hours that produced that. No devious desire in mind. I
                        would be prepared to discuss this with the President if the Prime Minister
                        thinks it has more merit than the draft I discussed with him yesterday.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Excuse the typing.

                    <p>I don't care about this clause, “additional obstacles.” This is a formula to

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It appears to be necessary.
                        Would you also put forward your other views?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. The other views
                        are really fairly simple. Where it says “in the area” to make it consistent,
                        why don't we say “as tensions in Asia diminish?” Then you and I know we are
                        talking about Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: (Repeats what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> just said.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, because then the
                        Prime Minister will understand what this refers to. This is our way of
                        understanding what we have said on Vietnam. Now, the rest of my changes, Mr.
                        Prime Minister, are an attempt to shorten somewhat the contentious part of
                        the material. I can accept your page two. I propose deleting the sentence
                        that starts at the bottom of page two with the word “the”, up to “all
                        foreign troops.”</p>
                    <p>Chou's Interpreter: What line please?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Seven, through
                        “subversion.”</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: To delete that?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It repeats a point you
                        have already made on the previous page. I am proposing a similar cut in our
                        section for symmetry. The only other deletion I would urge is where it deals
                        with Vietnam, that is to say, that “China expressed its firm support to the
                        seven-point program” and to omit the phrase “its firm support to the
                        struggle.”</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I might tell the Prime Minister for his own personal
                        information that I have just received word from the North Vietnamese that we
                        are going to resume negotiations toward the middle of November in our secret
                        channel, with Le Duc Tho, and maybe this whole thing will then no longer be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d55-04" facs="d55-04"/>
                    <p>That is the only suggestion I have in the statement of your principles. The
                        rest is acceptable. Then, on page four, from the point of view of symmetry,
                        I would propose deleting the second sentence, the one that begins with “The
                        United States side believes” through “or misunderstanding.” The sentence
                        that begins with “The United States believes that the effort to reduce
                        tension is served” through “misunderstanding.” And on the next page—I am
                        trying to shorten our statement a little bit—where we talk about Indochina,
                        we can leave out the phrase “to which end it had made a series of
                        proposals.” In other words we would just say its primary objective has been
                        a negotiated solution, but just leave out the next line where it says that
                        it had made a series of proposals. This is to shorten it and also to remove
                        any suspicion on the part of Hanoi that you have taken a position on the
                        secret negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The only other suggestion I have is that you have inadvertently dropped one
                        sentence from our position, which you had in the previous draft: “The
                        relation between the United States and the Republic of Korea was freely.
                        entered into by both sides, and the existing commitments would be honored.”
                        This is a statement of our view. It was on page 5 of your old draft.</p>
                    <p>These are all my changes. We can accept the remainder.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: What you have posed before us is
                        a difficult subject. Because in the statements of the two sides we have
                        maintained the principal contents of the American statement, such as
                        “peaceful competition,” “individual freedom,” and you put in the American
                        way of putting it about striving for freedom and progress which is different
                        from our interpretation of it, and we didn't make any objection to it. There
                        is no question but that our two sides have very deep differences on the
                        interpretation of these conceptions. And then in the part about the peoples
                        and nations, in the first part, you agreed that we may say “where there is
                        oppression, there is resistance” and you agreed to our formulation of
                        struggling for freedom and liberty. But then when we express our support for
                        this, you do not agree. It is hard to understand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am really trying to
                        shorten the document. If the Prime Minister wants to maintain that sentence
                        which I have to tell you will be extremely annoying to most Americans, but
                        if he wants to maintain it, then the alternative is to take out the sentence
                        which begins with “it must be recognized” up through “impermissible.” My
                        primary concern is to shorten it a little bit; and that is repeated
                        anyway.</p>

                        this is yesterday morning, in the discussion of this, one of the sentences
                        you suggested to be deleted was this. Originally your version was
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you want to keep
                        this sentence, let us propose dropping the other sentence. I am not dropping
                        both, just one or the other to shorten it somewhat. And I have tried to take
                        out an equivalent amount of our own position.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This is only a very initial
                        draft, and just before you leave to continue to consider the various
                        wordings is rather difficult. I think there shouldn't be much difficulty
                        here because they are of the same nature. I don't know about the number of
                        words, but as for the Chinese, the American statement is longer than the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am also cutting the
                        American statement. I am trying to cut the statement of differences. I am
                        not saying you are unfair; I am saying the whole document gives an
                        overwhelming impression of enormous differences and if we can both take out
                        half a page between us of sentences that are repeated, it would help the
                        balance of the document.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, as for possible
                        repetitions of wordings, that I admit. There are such repetitions. But in
                        the American statement also there are a number of repetitions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's why I'm trying
                        to cut it.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If we were to rewrite the whole
                        document we could make it more concise. But that is not the main point. We
                        have proposed in the documents places of common ground, and where there is
                        no common ground we keep in the Chinese statement that which you can't
                        accept and you keep in the American statement that which we can't accept. As
                        for the number of words in the actual Chinese text, the American statement
                        is still longer.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That doesn't bother me.
                        For instance, the sentence I am now proposing to delete, “the people”
                        through “impermissible”—that doesn't bother us. It's no problem to us from a
                        substantive point of view. And it is, in any event, repeated by the next
                        sentence, that all nations “should be equal,” and by the sentence that says
                        that the Chinese side supports the struggle of “oppressed people” for
                        “freedom and liberation.”</p>

                    <p>What I am trying to avoid is that out of a nine-page document, the first five
                        pages are disagreement. And therefore, I have taken out some lines from

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is the first part. In the
                        second part, concerning the question of Indochina, in our draft we have two
                        sentences, and you have three; then you remove one of them, one sentence
                        which we think is correct (to delete) because we did not take part in the
                        Vietnam negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I accept this, and I am

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But if we remove our wording to
                        reaffirm support for the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in their
                        struggle to realize their goals, then it will not be possible to express a
                        relaxation of tension in the Far East. We had already deleted that part
                        about supporting to the end the struggles of the Indochinese people, because
                        we hope before your President comes we will have settled the war in Vietnam,
                        and even if it had not been settled, we hope that it would be substantially

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I happen to know what
                        the Declaration of the Joint Summit Conference of the Indochinese people
                        says, and if you are supporting this, you are supporting their struggle.</p>

                        that is indeed so.</p>
                    <p>Then, with respect to your reference about the Republic of Korea, that was
                        not a matter of inadvertence on our part. We deliberately deleted that
                        because to our people it would be quite irritating to have that there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes but … we don't
                        insist that we say anything about Korea on either side.</p>

                        you know we bear certain responsibility in being a member of the negotiating

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we can drop in
                        our statement about the relations between the United States and the Republic
                        of Korea the fact that they were freely entered into, and simply say that
                        the existing commitments would <pb n="7" xml:id="d55-07" facs="d55-07"/>be
                        honored. But if you support the eight-point proposal, we have to say
                        something. But we can leave out the phrase “they were freely entered into”
                        which I can understand is irritating.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> still wants to try to arrive at an initial
                        agreement today.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no, but if the
                        Prime Minister feels that he must express his views on his side, we must be
                        free to express our views on our side. If the Chinese side expresses support
                        of the eight points of the Democratic Republic of Korea we have to say
                        something about our relationship to the Republic of Korea.</p>
                    <p>But I do admit the more we can settle today, the better it will be. It will
                        be harder next time I am here, and it's complex through Paris.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but on this one,

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then maybe we can …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: … this one sentence

                        wonder if it is possible for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to come again, or to wait for settlement when the

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If I come once again,
                        there is going to be the most unbelievable speculation.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But you know, as you will be
                        leaving China precisely at the time when the vote on Chinese representation
                        is being taken in the United Nations, there will also be difficulties for us
                        with the countries that are supporting us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, do
                        you know that I have been accused of exactly the same thing on our side?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is precisely why I say that
                        if we are to solve this question about the initial draft of the communique
                        we must put ourselves in the shoes of the other. Of course, this will still
                        be only an initial draft. And even if we do agree, when your President comes
                        we will still be able to make changes.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d55-08" facs="d55-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh yes, this is without
                        question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That will be because the
                        situation has changed. If it has not, for any of us to say there must be
                        changes, that will be to create deliberate trouble.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, as far as we
                        are concerned, no one outside the White House will know that such a draft
                        exists, much less that we discussed it, and we have never had a leak from
                        the White House. So, as far as our bureaucracy is concerned, we would simply
                        pretend that this is going to be done when we come here.</p>

                        Taiwan question, there is still some distance from our stand. Your wording
                        on the Taiwan formulation is not as explicit as our formulation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On your
                        formulation?</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But it is my firm
                        conviction, apart from my authorization, that it is extremely unlikely that
                        it will be accepted.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But you know that the crucial
                        question of the normalization of relations between China and the United
                        States is on this Taiwan question, so if we do not make clear the future of
                        this, how can we begin normalization? So then the whole question begins
                        again.</p>

                        knows what we would do, and I have the impression this is considered by him
                        to be in a positive direction. Therefore our problem is to find a
                        formulation which enables us to navigate between our various necessities,
                        domestic and international.</p>

                        You say, “The United States Government emphasized its view …”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Stated?”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is to say, your side
                        “emphasized its view that the Chinese people should realize, etc… .” If you
                        changed the word “objective” to “position” … And the second sentence, there
                        is no need for it, ”… and will not use its military presence in the Taiwan
                        Straits, etc.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This was done to meet a
                        point of the Prime Minister's.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That means not to participate in

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Nor to encourage any
                        activities to separate Taiwan from mainland. And also to meet the point the
                        Prime Minister made so eloquently last night that our forces are a guarantee
                        against the introduction of Japanese forces. But I am prepared to drop the
                        sentence if the Prime Minister would like it dropped.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As for the sentence before that,
                        “it emphasized its view… etc.” If you change the word “objective” to
                        “position” that will make things clear.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's bad English, but
                        if it pleases you … “objective” is a better word in English than “position,”
                        but it's no problem for me. I don't mind being accused of using bad grammar.
                        It's no problem.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I could … excuse me.
                        Why don't you finish.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is, “it hopes the
                        settlement of the Taiwan question consistent with this position will be
                        achieved through peaceful negotiations.” Of course, that is then more clear,
                        though it is not saying the whole thing out, yet it expresses in a more
                        clear way the hope of the American government and grammatically it's
                        better.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The trouble is that we

                        very well. The Prime Minister seeks clarity, and I am trying to achieve
                        ambiguity.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But the Chinese people will be

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we have got trouble
                        if it is too clear.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Actually, our wording is not so
                        different from yours; actually our versions are not already so clear. Please
                        think it over.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, if
                        we complete everything else, we can leave the Taiwan thing for the other
                        channel. We could simply send you a paragraph. I speak to you more frankly
                        than to any other foreign leader. For us, no agreement on Taiwan is going to
                        do any good for large elements of our bureaucracy, and our public will
                        oppose it. Therefore, it requires careful management on our side. What is
                        particularly difficult in your formulation—because I notice in many regards
                        it's quite close to what I gave you—is the phrase “finally withdraw.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But isn't that saying in your
                        version, “ultimate objective of the withdrawal of its forces"?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There's a nuanced
                        difference.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You are bound to withdraw in the
                        end; otherwise how can it return to the Motherland? Think it over. And what
                        is more, we said that you will progressively reduce and finally withdraw,
                        and there is no <pb n="11" xml:id="d55-11" facs="d55-11"/>time limit to it.
                        And I believe that when your President comes, if he undertakes such an
                        obligation, it will have a very favorable effect for the political future of
                        your President, not a bad one. Because, as you said, this was something
                        created by Truman, not something of your President or his party.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but as I said
                        yesterday, that is not the problem. The problem is the combination of
                        various forces that are looking for a symbol around which to rally.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, suppose you bring your
                        formulation back with you. When the President comes, there will be seven
                        days, and he will meet Chaiiman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        twice, and I am sure in the meeting it will not be difficult to settle it
                        when it comes to a matter of a few words. We spent almost one hour trying to
                        find a formulation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be good
                        negotiating tactics, Mr. Prime Minister, to say that you are being
                        unreasonable, but I realize that is not true. I realize you have made major
                        efforts to take our concerns into account. You have behaved toward us with
                        great honor. But those of my colleagues in America who have not had the
                        privilege of meeting you, and those who have a vested interest in destroying
                        our policy, will look at it with a different perspective than I who has had
                        an opportunity to hear your position.</p>
                    <p>But we can probably not settle the Taiwan draft now. Let me take this back.
                        You have one suggested alternative which you can perhaps think about. I will
                        work with the President to see whether we can come up with a draft either
                        accepting this or modifying it, and we will attempt to treat you with the
                        same honor with which you have treated us. We can pass some drafts back and
                        forth through our channel. Of course, we are already coming closer. And then
                        if it isn't settled, we can settle it perhaps when the President comes
                        here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, I believe that if it cannot
                        be settled, then by the time the President comes it could be, because we
                        have to take into consideration your various difficulties. On the sentence
                        before that (the first sentence on page 8 of Tab A), we fully agree to it.
                        There is no question about that, that is on the formulation that “the United
                        States acknowledged that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits
                        maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a province of China.”
                        That solves the question <pb n="12" xml:id="d55-12" facs="d55-12"/>of a
                        split, because <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> on the
                        other side of the Taiwan Straits also considers there is only one China.</p>
                    <p>And then the second part of it is you express the hope the settlement of the
                        Taiwan question consistent with this position will be achieved through
                        peaceful negotiations. So in this way you are not restricted by any specific
                        condition, such as that we will have to liberate Taiwan by suchand-such a
                        date. We don't say that.</p>
                    <p>And so, as for the part on the withdrawal of the United States armed forces,
                        we originally mentioned the forces will be withdrawn after you had withdrawn
                        all your forces from Indochina. That is what you told us. But now we don't
                        mention it. So in the formulation there is no time limit, and of course this
                        will be connected with relaxation of tension in the Far East. But we don't
                        put this explicitly down. So we took into account your difficulties by not
                        making a clear time limit. So this formulation has taken into account
                        difficulties on both sides, especially yours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Again, I recognize that
                        you have attempted to be just, and I said to my colleague last night that if
                        you could convince your colleagues in Hanoi to approach us with your spirit,
                        we could settle the war in two afternoons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But it cannot be so, because
                        every country has their own characteristics.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And that is why I appreciate the
                        sentence that suggests that neither side will negotiate on behalf of any
                        third party. And then you deleted that part of your formulation about having
                        made a series of proposals to that end. You did right that way.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, because we have no
                        interest in complicating your position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So as for the formulation on
                        Taiwan, suppose you bring it back and discuss it with your President, and if
                        there are no big differences between your views and our formulation then it
                        might not be necessary to communicate on it through our channels before the
                        President comes.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d55-13" facs="d55-13"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One point I have never
                        raised is that we need a peg to hang on this statement of withdrawal. We can
                        do it by saying, “as tensions in Asia diminish”. Another is if you state
                        unilaterally, not as a joint statement, your intention to settle this
                        question peacefully. Then we can say that “in view of this statement” the
                        U.S. will progressively reduce its forces.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's a thing of the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you mean?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because at the present time the
                        Taiwan regime is still usurping our seat in the United Nations. They claim
                        to represent it now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I don't understand
                        what that has to do with it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is related. Think it over.
                        How would they approve of us declaring that we want to effect the peaceful
                        liberation of Taiwan?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How would Taiwan …
                        ?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He won't approve
                        anything you do anyway.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But particularly if we were to
                        say that this formulation is better—it's more or less like yours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I think I
                        understand your point of view. It's too important an issue to be settled
                        here at the table. I will take it back. You have two versions of our
                        position. We have your version which we can study. I will either tell you
                        through our channel that things are fairly close and we will settle it when
                        the President comes, or I will send you another formulation through the
                        channel, or I will send a formulation with General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. And let's leave it at that. Or if
                        everything fails, maybe I will come back a few weeks before the President
                        comes because we really should avoid too much controversy while he is
                        here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We persist in our formulation.
                        So when you … it is not possible to reach an agreement here today. When you
                        go back, please report to your President our view, and the situation that
                        only such a formulation is acceptable.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d55-14" facs="d55-14"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That I have to
                        understand clearly. You are saying it is either this formulation or nothing
                        else?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When we compare it with your
                        formulation, yours is not so clear. For us it is not so completely clear
                        either. Although the direction is clear, the time has not been limited. So
                        when you go back, if it's only a matter of one or two words, then that can
                        be done through our channel. Otherwise, it would be better for Your
                        Excellency to come again, or wait for your President to come.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You don't want to
                        discuss this in the channel?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As you said, in a complicated
                        matter like this we couldn't make ourselves clear through our channel. It
                        would be much better for you to come back, because we have dealt with the
                        backgrounds of our two sides, and all this background knowledge is known by
                        you and by us, but not by the other diplomats.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. All right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: For us we are also running a
                        risk here. That is, we are placing our reliance on your President,
                        continuing to remain in office, and Your Excellency continuing to be his
                        assistant. But we cannot speak on behalf of the American people. We don't
                        know whether they will choose you or not. So even after your President
                        comes, and even if he undertakes such an obligation, if he is not voted into
                        office for the next term, we don't know whether it will be put into
                        implementation.</p>
                    <p>As I told you last night, when Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> spoke to Edgar Snow, he was sure your President will be
                        able to resolve this question. And Life Magazine made that quite clear in
                        the article written by Mr. Snow, and that was quite authoritative. And
                        yesterday we were discussing the Taiwan question. We have already told you
                        all of our thinking on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not asking you

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think you believe we
                        are serious about that which we said we would do. Our problem domestically
                        is as follows: If we accept a formulation that has the consequence of
                        exciting all the traditional supporters of the President, and if as a result
                        of that he is defeated, and if therefore the China lobby has proved its
                        political strength, then it will not be possible to carry out what we have
                        told you we will carry out, and what we will carry out.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The China lobby is of no great
                        strength now. It is different from what it was ten years ago.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not by itself, but the
                        combination of the conservative element and them is of some strength.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But the crucial question here is
                        not our problem, but the problem of Indochina, the question of the
                        withdrawal of troops from Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But that we can
                        handle.</p>

                        then the Taiwan question is a small matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, not domestically. I
                        have not haggled with you about the substance of what we are going to do. It
                        is odd that we should spend so little time on substance, and so much time on
                        words. We do not differ in substance.</p>

                        have their difficulties with regard to the wording which is to be used.
                        That's why we must be careful, and we have been taking into account your

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If I were bargaining, I
                        wouldn't keep saying you have been fair. We have an objective problem here.
                        But I think we cannot go further today. I will take this back. If we have a
                        concrete formulation I may ask General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> to bring it. He has my complete confidence. You may not
                        want to discuss it with him, but he can at least bring it to you. And he
                        knows about this, but not, of course, in the detail you and I do. And if <pb n="16" xml:id="d55-16" facs="d55-16"/>we have not agreed before the
                        President comes, then maybe I will find some way of coming for a day or two,
                        two or three weeks before he comes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So let us put it at that
                        then.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we will approach it
                        with the attitude of having a constructive outcome.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me go back to the rest of the document. It is probably impossible
                        for you to believe how hard it is for Americans to understand your
                        particular approach to problems. I understand it. But when we prepared our
                        technical presentation, for example, all my colleagues thought I was mad
                        because I said, “give the Chinese all the facts of our internal
                        considerations and give them a minimum position and they will treat you
                        fairly.” All my colleagues said let's give them a maximum position, and then
                        compromise; let us not give them anything in writing; and let us then just
                        start talking to them. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs.)
                        I had to go to the very top to get an order that everybody had to put his
                        requests in writing so we could let you study everything we knew.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I understand that your approach is principled. When I was
                        recommending some cuts in the beginning, it wasn't in order to make a
                        substantive point. It is really that I am afraid that when the President
                        reads this document and sees the first five pages list nothing but
                        disagreements he will say, “what is it really that we are trying to do
                        here?” He has never seen a document like this before. This is why I
                        recommended some cuts on your side and on our side, leaving aside the
                        Vietnam sentences because that may be taken care of anyway. We can wait and
                        it may be settled, or we can do it when we come. But if we could cut one of
                        the sentences, either on page two or three, plus our sentence on page four,
                        so to compress it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, I will then suggest a
                        formulation for the linking of these two sentences. You suggested that “It
                        must be recognized… , etc.”, that sentence be deleted?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then this is maintained,
                        that is “the Chinese side stated that it firmly supports the struggles of
                        all the oppressed peoples and <pb n="17" xml:id="d55-17" facs="d55-17"/>nations for freedom and liberation”, and then following after that would
                        be “and that the people of all countries have the right to choose their
                        social systems according to their own wishes and have the right to safeguard
                        the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of their own
                        countries and oppose foreign aggression, interference, control and
                        subversion.” Let's put these two sentences together in order to prevent
                        repetition.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How will that save
                        space?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It does save space.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Will you read the
                        sentence?</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: “The Chinese side stated that it firmly supports the struggles
                        of all the oppressed peoples and nations for freedom and liberation and that
                        the people of all countries…”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: ”… have the right to choose their social systems according to
                        their own wishes, and the right to safeguard the independence, sovereignty,
                        and territorial integrity of their own countries and oppose foreign
                        aggression, interference, control and subversion.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's all right. Will
                        you get one of your genius interpreters to put that into good English. I
                        find it depressing that your interpreters write better English than English
                        writers. These documents are beautifully written—I don't mean it as a
                        joke—with great clarity. I will delete in our section the sentence on page
                        four which begins with “The U.S. side believes”, through “misunderstanding.”
                        This is just to save space; I don't object to it.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We don't either. It has little
                        to do with us. It has to do with your relations with the Soviet Union. So
                        you may either put it in or not; we don't care.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me discuss it with
                        the President. I will delete on the Indochinese question the phrase “to
                        which end it had made a series of proposals.” Will just say its “primary
                        objective has been a negotiated solution.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then we must—here you have three
                        sentences concerning Indochina—we must maintain our sentence of support for
                        the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will take out the
                        sentence, then, that “its primary objective has been a negotiated
                        solution.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is, you hope that we will
                        not use the sentence to support the struggle of the people of Vietnam, Laos
                        and Cambodia to attain their goal?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your
                        problem and your desires. I believe you genuinely want a peaceful settlement
                        of the war.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You don't think you are
                        expressing support in supporting the Joint Declaration of the Summit
                        Conference of the Indochinese Peoples?</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, but there is still a
                        shortcoming there, because in general terms it is necessary for us to
                        express our support to the peoples of the three countries of Indochina. I
                        suggest for, the sake of deleting some words to delete the seven-point
                        proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam question. Let us just
                        say the seven-point proposal put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary
                        Government of the Republic of South Vietnam. Because this is clear, and
                        words will be saved. We would hope you will settle it. We would hope you
                        will be able to settle your problems with Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why don't we leave this
                        open, seeing how the negotiations go? For example, it may be totally
                        irrelevant for you to support the seven-point proposal by the time the
                        President gets here.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But the sentence before that

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we have an agreement
                        in principle with Hanoi, then the sentence before that is no problem to us.
                        The sentence before that is a problem to us if American prisoners of war are
                        still being held in large numbers in Vietnam, if American soldiers are still
                        being killed, and if an American President has to come 12,000 miles to be
                        told that they are supporting this, even if they are doing so.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know, but it has
                        become a very emotional problem, which goes beyond rational discussion in
                        America at this moment.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well then, suppose we just say
                        “firm support to the struggle of the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia”
                        and stop there, and leave out the words “for the attainment of their
                        goal.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, that will help a
                        little. It's the “struggle” part that is the problem.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: (laughs) There is this question;
                        you don't like the word “struggle.” We don't believe in the word “peace” so
                        very much, but there are a lot of words “peace” in this document. We don't
                        believe that it will be so easy to attain world peace. But we do admit that
                        the sentiments of the people of the world want peace if they are not
                        oppressed. Yet, at the duck dinner the day before yesterday, I explained why
                        we went to Chungking for the negotiations after the war.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I read the essay of
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> on the Chungking
                        negotiations with great care.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So, although we don't believe it
                        is so easy to attain world peace, nevertheless … in fact, we often say we
                        struggle for peace. It's our philosophy of struggle.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As a philosopher, I
                        agree more with you than with the sentimentalists who use peace as a slogan.
                        Few great changes of history have occurred on the basis of abstract
                        argument. So if we were discussing world outlooks, I would have no problem
                        with that point of view. <pb n="20" xml:id="d55-20" facs="d55-20"/>The
                        problem here is a serious domestic one, which is for the President to answer
                        the question of what were you doing going 12,000 miles to be told, if the
                        war is still going on, to be told this. If it is not, you believe the
                        struggle will continue. I believe it too, but the domestic question for us
                        will be quite difficult.</p>

                        the American people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but they don't know
                        your particular vocabulary. And they have never had to struggle as you have
                        had to.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but not of the

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>
                        suggests another word—that is support for the “efforts.” That might be
                        better?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. He hasn't wasted
                        his time in England.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let us take this
                        tentatively and reconsider it when the President comes here, or if I come
                        here, in light of my negotiations with the North Vietnamese. But
                        tentatively, let us say “efforts.”</p>

                    <p>Then the only other thing left is that we have to say something about
                        existing commitments to the Republic of Korea. We will delete the phrase
                        “were freely entered into” which we understand is difficult. This is just
                        our statement.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, just to make sure
                        we understand each other, should I ask to have typed up what we understand
                        the correct version to be so there is no misunderstanding?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Would you kindly read out again
                        that part on the Republic of Korea.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (referring to page five
                        of Tab A and earlier U. S. draft) “The existing commitments between the
                        United States and the Republic of Korea would be honored.” We leave: this in
                        the sentence: “The United States would support all efforts of the Republic
                        of Korea to seek a relaxation of the tension and increased communication in
                        the Korean peninsula.” The one that says, “were freely entered into by both
                        sides” is deleted. Now, if the Prime Minister is agreeable … Oh, I need his
                        (interpreter's) version of that other sentence. May I raise a number of
                        other … . You have your own problems?</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So we will just give
                        you the text, leaving the one paragraph on Taiwan in your formulation, but
                        we will underline it to say it must be discussed with the President. It's
                        not agreed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This evening, but only a simple
                        release, saying that you viewed some places of interest, not saying where
                        you went. You can disclose that after you go back to the United States, cite
                        those places that you visited.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, it's better not to.
                        If you don't mind, I can do it, or you could do it, after your announcement.
                        You see, when I arrive in Washington tonight our time, I will be greeted by
                        a lot of newsmen, and I will say I must report to the President, and I will
                        say nothing until we release the announcement. Then I will give a background
                        briefing at 4:00 tomorrow afternoon our time when we make the announcement,
                        and on that occasion I might mention the places we have visited.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So for us, we will just release
                        tonight something saying you have left China after engaging in some talks,
                        and viewing some places of interest, without citing specific places. Maybe
                        we will cite those of our people who will see you off at the airport, the
                        Vice Chairman, the Acting Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly, that is

                    <p>When I am asked tomorrow what we discussed, what does the Prime Minister
                        recommend that I say?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is better for you to decide
                        that. Think it over yourself on what you think you should say. We had talks,
                        that is certain.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will say that we
                        discussed technical arrangements, and we began discussing in a general way
                        the agenda.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If they ask me was
                        there any discussion of Japan or Taiwan or Vietnam, I will say I will not go
                        into the substance. (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods. ) And
                        then, if I am asked about a communique, I will say that we don't have one.
                        And I will send you the briefing through the regular channel as soon as I
                        can get it to Paris.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then we can coordinate with
                        you on that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. My understanding
                        is that we will propose to you a date for the announcement of the
                        President's visit, and that it will be around November 22. If the
                        correspondents ask me when will the visit be announced, I will say in a few
                        weeks.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Good.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I will make a
                        proposal to you within a week or ten days about our proposed date for the
                        announcement which will be around November 22.</p>
                    <p>

                        Anyway, no later than the 24th.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Between the 20th and
                        the 24th. But I have to check our schedules when I get back, and if it makes
                        no difference to you, I will let you know.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is not a big
                        problem. My understanding is that you have agreed to some of the technical
                        people, headed by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>, to
                        come after that announcement, after December 1.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is so. How do you spell

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Like the general who
                        was so bad in World War I, H-A-I-G. But he's very good, and he has my
                        complete confidence. He's less complicated than I, but he knows everything
                        on our work.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And he will bring some technical
                        people with him?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and he will keep
                        them under strict control. He's a firmer personality than I.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to raise one other question with the Prime Minister if I could,
                        which I also did last time, which concerns the American prisoners in
                        China.</p>

                        agents?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Those two and then the
                        two pilots. But they are two separate cases.</p>
                    <p>When I was here last time, Mr. Prime Minister, I knew only that you held
                        these prisoners, but I did not know the facts, because I could not inquire
                        for obvious reasons. I have now inquired, and I find that Fecteau and Downey
                        did engage in activities that would be considered illegal by any
                        country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Therefore, our plea to
                        you has nothing to do with the justice of the case. In fact, we concede that
                        you have a correct legal case. But if, as an act of clemency, you could
                        consider that they have been punished sufficiently, it would make a very
                        good impression in the United States.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: According to our legal
                        procedures, if a criminal in our prisons behaves himself well, that is if he
                        confesses to his crime, then we can lessen the sentence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know whether
                        they have confessed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They have all confessed. And it
                        is possible in about two months time we may consider lessening the sentences
                        of some of them who have behaved themselves well. As for who that will be we
                        will tell you later. In the early part of this year we already released an
                        old man, Walsh.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am aware of that. We
                        would do our best to see to it that anyone you release would not engage in
                        any propaganda against the People's Republic when he returns.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well, Walsh didn't behave
                        badly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, Walsh did not
                        behave badly.</p>
                    <p>The two pilots, to the best of my knowledge, are victims of the war. They
                        made an honest mistake in flying over Chinese territory, unless I am totally
                        misinformed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It is indeed true, they did fly
                        into our air space. Otherwise, we could not have shot them down.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but to the best of
                        my knowledge, it was unintentional and therefore is a different case from
                        Fecteau and Downey.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But we have to deal with them in
                        a different light, because the war in Vietnam has not yet ended, and if we
                        released them before it ended, it might give some bad impressions.</p>
                    <p>So it might be possible that we could release the spies earlier, although
                        their crimes were heavier. They have been in prison a long time. One has
                        almost served out his sentence. Maybe first we will solve the question of
                        one of the two.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would mean a great
                        deal to the American people. And we would treat it as an act of clemency,
                        and not as something we have a right to request, and any public explanation
                        we would make would be in that framework.</p>
                    <p>The only other thing… I have only two other things, Mr. Prime Minister.
                        First, I wanted to thank everybody who has made this visit so memorable and
                        so useful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's what they should do, and
                        such work will still be done in the future.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not only you, but all
                        of your associates, interpreters, drivers, everybody behaved with
                        extraordinary courtesy and efficiency. All of my doubting colleagues who
                        questioned me before we came now know that they are dealing with men of
                        principle. (Chou nods)</p>
                    <p>Now, I have only one other personal thing to say to you, Mr. Prime Minister.
                        A friend of mine, who is a collector of Chinese art, before I left sent me
                        something which he wanted me, as a token of the pleasure Chinese art has
                        given him, to bring back something from America to China. It is something in
                        the form of a lotus flower, which he tells me means peace and serenity in
                        traditional China. And so I have taken the liberty of bringing this with me.
                        It is a totally unofficial gift which indicates the feeling of the American
                        people for what China has meant to so many of them. It is not worth a great
                        deal, but it is a symbol of the attitude with which all of us will come on
                        our journies next year to improve relations between our peoples and to move
                        from hostility to friendship.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. I can tell you his
                        name. It's Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> of
                        New York, But he did not particularly want it to be from him personally.</p>

                        for us to give him a return gift this time, but when General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> comes we will ask him to take back
                        a return gift, and since Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> likes Chinese art, we will select a piece of
                        Chinese art and ask General Haig to take it back to him.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He didn't want me to
                        mention his name.</p>

                        because we know he is a friend who wants to be a friend of China.</p>
                    <p>We will have to dispense with the general meeting?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And to whom should we
                        give our understanding of the communique? We will get it retyped, just so
                        there's no misunderstanding.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I think Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> can ask (one of our people) to take it
                        for us, and we will get it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, and if
                        there's any problem you could tell us before we leave, and if not, then
                        through Paris.</p>

                            Tse-tung</persName> again for further talks on ____________). President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> held extensive discussions
                        with Premier Chou En-lai on the normalization of relations between the

                        people for the Chinese people.</p>
                    <p>General Principles of Bilateral Relations</p>
                    <p>The two leaders acknowledged that the long-standing differences between the
                        two countries not only in their bilateral relations but in their
                        perspectives of international problems would not quickly or easily be
                        resolved. At the same time, the two sides agreed that the visit of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to China and the hospitable
                        reception accorded him demonstrate that countries, irrespective of their
                        social systems, can work together toward resolution of differences in the
                        interest of international peace and security.</p>
                    <p>Aware of what divides them but equally conscious of their responsibilities
                        toward all nations to cooperate in building a just and lasting peace, the
                        President and the Premier agreed to conduct their international affairs on
                        the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,
                        non-aggression, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, equality
                        and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. They undertook to approach the
                        elimination of the differences between their countries through peaceful
                        negotiations, and, pending final resolutions, to renounce the threat or use
                        of force in settling matters at issue between their two countries.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d56-03" facs="d56-03"/>
                    <p>They recognized that there were also significant specific areas of mutual
                        interest between their two countries. Both wish to reduce the danger of
                        military conflict. And each seeks better understanding and mutual benefit
                        through all forms of increased international contact including trade as well
                        as cultural, scientific and technical exchange. They agreed that the
                        broadening of mutual areas of interest would contribute to their shared
                        objective of working toward the normalization of relations. Each would
                        continue to seek out additional areas of cooperation with the other.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Premier declared that neither of their countries seeks
                        hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, and that each is opposed to efforts by
                        any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.</p>
                    <p>Both President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier Chou
                        En-lai emphasized that neither was prepared to negotiate on behalf of any
                        third country or to enter into agreements or understandings directed at
                        other states. At the same time they agreed that progress toward the
                        normalization of relations between their two countries in itself represented
                        progress toward a secure and lasting peace and was therefore in the
                        interests of all countries. The two sides agreed that it would be against
                        the interests of the peoples of the world for any major power to collude
                        with another against a third, or to behave in such a way as to suggest that
                        it had an exclusive sphere of interest.</p>

                    <p>General View of the World Situation</p>
                    <p>During the talks, both sides noted with regret that turmoil still exists in
                        many parts of the world and that the danger of military conflict remains.
                        They expressed the hope that, on the basis of the principles enumerated
                        above, potential conflicts could be averted and that steps to eliminate
                        their causes could be initiated. To this end, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> clarified their positions with
                        respect to a number of areas where they might contribute toward a more
                        peaceful environment.</p>
                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also clarified their
                        respective positions concerning Taiwan. Premier Chou En-lai stated that
                        Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China, and that the
                        future of Taiwan is therefore an internal matter. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that the U.S. acknowledges
                        that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but
                        one China. The United States Government takes note of that position and will
                        support efforts to reach an equitable and peaceful resolution of the
                        ultimate relationship of Taiwan to the mainland. Premier Chou En-lai
                        observed that the People's Republic of China has not chosen force of arms as
                        a means of resolving the issue.</p>
                    <p>Bilateral Relations</p>
                    <p>President Ninon and Premier Chou En-lai expressed awareness that the
                        objective of achieving restoration of full relations between their two
                        countries would require time and patience on both sides. They resolved that
                        efforts to reach this goal would continue, building upon the gains achieved
                        during President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to the
                        People's Republic of China. <pb n="5" xml:id="d56-05" facs="d56-05"/>They
                        agreed therefore that negotiations on outstanding issues would be carried on
                        by means of further periodic visits to Peking by senior representatives of
                        the United States Government, who would remain for the length of time
                        necessary to clarify the positions of both sides.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that the United States Government was prepared to
                        conclude with the People's Republic of China any arms control agreement that
                        it has concluded with other major powers.</p>
                    <p>Pending the normalization of relations, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier Chou En-lai agreed that a number of
                        concrete steps would be taken to maintain contacts and to improve the
                        understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and between the
                        United States of America and the People's Republic of China. These steps
                        will include:</p>
                    <p>— The facilitation of exchanges between the American and Chinese peoples of a
                        scientific, technical, commercial, cultural, educational, and personal
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>— The facilitation of the travel of newsmen to each country on a reciprocal
                        basis, including the early establishment of resident press bureaus in each
                        country.</p>
                    <p>— The two sides agreed to reduce obstacles to mutual commerce, and the
                        President specifically declared the intention of his Government to ease
                        further some U.S. trade restrictions.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Premier were gratified to have this opportunity, after
                        so many years without contact between the leaders of their two countries,
                            <pb n="6" xml:id="d56-06" facs="d56-06"/>to discuss world problems and
                        to present authoritatively to one another their respective views on a great
                        variety of issues. Both leaders are convinced that such an exchange of views
                        has in itself contributed to a better understanding and a reduction in
                        tension between their two countries.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his appreciation for the gracious hospitality shown
                        him and his party by the Government and people of the People's Republic of
                        China.</p>

                    <p>JOINT COMMUNIQUE (Tentative Draft)</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> of the United
                        States of America visited the People's Republic of China at the invitation
                        of Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> of the People's
                        Republic of China from __________ to __________, 1972. Accompanying the
                        President on his visit were (Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>,) U.S. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName> and Assistant to the President Dr. Henry A.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met with Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tsetung</persName> of the Communist Party
                        of China on __________ and __________, and the two sides held conversation
                        for ____ hours and had an exchange of views on Sino-U.S. relations and world
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>During the visit, talks were held between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier Chou En-lai. The two
                        sides held extensive, earnest and frank discussions on the normalization of
                        relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of
                        China, as well as on other matters of interest to both sides.</p>
                    <p>Also taking part in the talks on the Chinese side were:</p>
                    <p>Also taking part in the talks on the U.S. side were:</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his party visited
                        Peking and viewed cultural, industrial and agricultural sites, and they also
                        toured __________ where they viewed similar places of interest.</p>
                    <p>During their meetings and talks, the leaders of China and the <pb n="8" xml:id="d56-08" facs="d56-08"/>United States reviewed the international
                        situation in which important changes are taking place and great turmoil
                        exists and expounded their respective positions. The Chinese side pointed
                        out that wherever there is oppression, there is resistance. Countries want
                        independence, nations want liberation and the people want to make
                        revolution—this has become the irresistible trend of history. It must be
                        recognized that the people of ail countries have the right to choose their
                        social systems according to their own wishes and settle the affairs of their
                        respective countries as independent and sovereign nations. The peoples'
                        revolutionary struggles are just, and they deserve sympathy and support and
                        absoultely permit of no foreign intervention. The Chinese people firmly
                        support the struggles of all the oppressed people and nations for freedom
                        and liberation and against oppression and racial discrimination and firmly
                        support the people's struggles to safeguard the independence, sovereignty
                        and territorial integrity of their own countries and oppose foriegn
                        aggression, interference, control and subversion. All foreign troops should
                        be withdrawn to their own countries. All nations, big or small, should be
                        equal; big nations should not bully the small and strong nations should not
                        bully the weak. China will never be a superpower, and it opposes hegemony
                        and power politics of any kind. The U.S. side declared that … … … …</p>
                    <p>There are essential differences between China and the United States in their
                        social systems and foreign policies. However, the two sides agreed that
                        relations between states should be conducted on the principles <pb n="9" xml:id="d56-09" facs="d56-09"/>of respect for the sovereignty and
                        territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
                        non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and
                        mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and that on this basis,
                        international disputes should be settled without resorting to the use or
                        threat of force. It would be against the interests of the peoples of the
                        world for any major country to collude with another against other countries,
                        or to behave in such a way as to suggest that it had an exclusive sphere of
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>The two sides stated that neither was prepared to negotiate on behalf of any
                        third party or to enter into agreements or understandings directed at other
                        states.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the two countries held that the Indochina question, especially
                        the Viet Nam question, is the most urgent question for the relaxation of
                        tension in the Far East. The Chinese side stated that the Chinese Government
                        fully supports the seven-point proposal for the peaceful settlement of the
                        Viet Nam question put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of
                        the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Joint Declaration of the Summit
                        Conference of the Indochinese Peoples, that the Chinese people pledge
                        themselves to provide a powerful backing for the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos
                        and Cambodia, that Chinese territory forever remains the reliable rear area
                        of the three Indochinese peoples and that the Chinese people are prepared to
                        undertake the greatest national <pb n="10" xml:id="d56-10" facs="d56-10"/>sacrifices and firmly support the three Indochinese peoples in fighting to
                        the end for the attainment of their goal. The U.S. side stated … … … … … The
                        two sides agreed that the basic principle guiding the settlement of the
                        Indochina question is: All foreign troops must withdraw from the region of
                        Indochina, and the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia should be left to
                        settle their own questions by themselves free from foreign interference.</p>
                    <p>The two sides noted that eighteen years have already elapsed since the
                        signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, yet the Korean question remains
                        unsettled. The Chinese Government fully supports the eight-point programme
                        for the peaceful unification of Korea put forward by the Government of the
                        Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 12, 1971; the U.S. troops
                        should withdraw from south Korea completely; it is impermissible to
                        introduce the Japanese militarist forces into south Korea; and the “U.N.
                        Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea” should be
                        abolished. The U.S. side stated … … … … …</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side expressed its firm opposition to the revival and outward
                        expansion of Japanese militarism, maintained that the United States should
                        withdraw all its troops and all its nuclear and military bases from Japan
                        and return Okinawa unconditionally, and held that an independent,
                        democratic, peaceful and neutral Japan may have such <pb n="11" xml:id="d56-11" facs="d56-11"/>armed forces as are necessary for its
                        self-defence. The U.S. side stated: ___________________.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the two countries expressed deep concern over the tension in
                        the south Asian subcontinent. The two sides opposed the interference in the
                        internal affairs of Pakistan from any quarters by exploiting the situation
                        in East Pakistan. The two sides hoped that India and Pakistan could resolve
                        their differences through peaceful negotiations. All attempts to disturb
                        peace and use armed force are contrary to the interests of the people of
                        this region and should be condemned.</p>
                    <p>The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious disputes between China and
                        the United States and agreed that the Taiwan question is the crucial
                        question obstructing the normalization of relations between the two
                        countries. The Chinese side reaffirmed its position; The Government of the
                        People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China; Taiwan is
                        a part of Chinese territory which has long been returned to the motherland;
                        the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair in which no other
                        country has the right to interfere; and the U.S. troops must withdraw from
                        Taiwan. The Chinese Government firmly opposes any activities which aim at
                        the creation of “one China, two governments”, “two Chinas”, “one China, one
                        Taiwan”, an “independent Taiwan” or advocate that “the status of Taiwan
                        remains to be determined.” The U.S. side state: The United States
                        acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain
                        there is but one China; the United States <pb n="12" xml:id="d56-12" facs="d56-12"/>will encourage the Chinese to settle this internal
                        question by themselves through peaceful negotiations; it will not carry out
                        or support any activities aimed at separating Taiwan from China and will
                        withdraw the U.S. troops and military installations in Taiwan after it has
                        completed the withdrawal of all the U.S. armed forces from Indochina. The
                        two sides held that the settlement of this crucial issue between China and
                        the United States and the normalization of relations between the two
                        countries are not only in the interests of the Chinese and American peoples
                        but also conducive to the relaxation of tension in Asia and the world. The
                        two sides are resolved to work for the attainment of this goal and have
                        reached an understanding on certain steps that are to be taken. While
                        effecting these steps, the U.S. Government will send senior representatives
                        to Peking at unfixed intervals for concrete consultations.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that pending the normalization of relations between the
                        two countries, the Governments of the two countries would respectively take
                        measures to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two peoples and
                        their contacts in the scientific, technical, journalistic and cultural
                        fields.</p>
                    <p>The two sides were gratified to have this opportunity, after so many years
                        without contact between the leaders of their two countries, to present
                        frankly to one another their respective views on a variety of issues. The

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> of the United
                        States of America visited the People's Republic of China at the invitation

                        relations and world affairs.</p>
                    <p>During the visit, further talks were held between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier Chou En-lai. The two
                        sides held extensive, earnest and frank discussions on the normalization of
                        relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of
                        China, as well as on other matters of interest to both sides.</p>

                        Peking and viewed cultural, industrial and agricultural sites, and they also
                        toured __________ and __________ where they, continuing discussions with
                        Chinese leaders, viewed similar places of interest.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d56-15" facs="d56-15"/>
                    <p>During their meetings and talks, the leaders of China and the United States
                        reviewed the international situation in which important changes are taking
                        place and expounded their respective positions. The Chinese side stated its
                        views as follows: Wherever there is oppression, there is resistance.
                        Countries want independence, nations want liberation, and the people want
                        justice. It must be recognized that the people of all countries have the
                        right to choose their social systems according to their own wishes, and
                        settle the affairs of their respective countries as independent and
                        sovereign nations. Foreign intervention is impermissible. The Chinese people
                        firmly support the right of nations to safeguard their independence,
                        sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose foreign aggression,
                        interference, control and subversion. All nations, big or small, should be
                        equal; big nations should not bully the small and strong nations should not
                        bully the weak. China will never be a superpower.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side declared that peace in Asia and peace in the world required
                        efforts both to reduce immediate tensions and to eliminate the basic causes
                        of conflict. The U.S. side believes that the effort to reduce tension is
                        served by improving communication between countries that have different
                        world outlooks so as to lessen the risks of confrontation through accident,
                        miscalculation, or misunderstanding. Such an effort requires that countries
                        treat each other with mutual respect, not with censure, and with a
                        willingness to compete peacefully letting performance be the ultimate judge.
                            <pb n="16" xml:id="d56-16" facs="d56-16"/>Equality means that no country
                        should claim infallibility and that each country will be prepared to
                        re-examine its own attitudes for the common good. The U.S. side believes
                        that the effort to erase the fundamental sources of conflict is served by
                        building a just and secure peace, just because it fulfills the aspirations
                        of peoples and nations for freedom and progress; secure because it removes
                        the danger of foreign aggression. The U.S. supports individual freedom and
                        social progress for all the peoples of the world, free of outside pressure
                        or intervention.</p>
                    <p>There are essential differences between China and the United States in their
                        social systems and foreign policies. However, the two sides, aware of what
                        divides them but equally conscious of their responsibilities for world
                        peace, agreed that:</p>
                    <p>— countries, irrespective of their social systems, have a common interest in
                        working toward a resolution of international differences in the interest of
                        all mankind;</p>
                    <p>— relations between states should be conducted on the principles of respect
                        for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, nonaggression
                        against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other
                        states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence.
                        International disputes should be settled on this basis, without resorting to
                        the use or threat of force;</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d56-17" facs="d56-17"/>
                    <p>— it is against the interests of the peoples of the world for any major
                        country to collude with another against other countries, or to behave in
                        such a way as to suggest that it had an exclusive sphere of interest.</p>
                    <p>With these principles of international relations in mind the two sides stated
                        that:</p>
                    <p>— both wish to reduce the danger of military conflict;</p>
                    <p>— neither seeks hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to
                        efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such
                        hegemony;</p>
                    <p>— neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to enter
                        into agreements or understandings directed at other states;</p>
                    <p>— progress toward the normalization of relations between the two countries is
                        in the interests of all countries; and</p>
                    <p>— broadening of mutual areas of interest would contribute to their shared
                        objective of working toward the normalization of relations.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the two countries discussed the Indochina question. The
                        Chinese side stated that this issue, especially the Vietnam question, is the
                        most urgent question for the relaxation of tension in the Far East. The
                        Chinese Government fully supports the seven-point proposal for the peaceful
                        settlement of the Vietnam question put forward by the Provisional
                        Revolutionary government of the Republic of South Vietnam and the <pb n="18" xml:id="d56-18" facs="d56-18"/>Joint Declaration of the Summit
                        Conference of the Indochinese Peoples. The U.S. side stated that the peoples
                        of Indochina should be allowed to determine their destiny without outside
                        intervention, that its constant primary objective has been a negotiated
                        solution of the Indochina conflict to which end it had made a series of
                        proposals; and that in the absence of a negotiated settlement it envisaged
                        the ultimate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the region consistent with
                        the aim of true self-determination for each country of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that the basic principle guiding the settlement of the
                        Indochina question is: All foreign troops should withdraw from each of the
                        countries of Indochina, and the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia should
                        be left to settle their own questions by themselves free from foreign
                        interference.</p>
                    <p>The two sides noted that eighteen years have already elapsed since the
                        signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, yet there is still no permanent
                        legal status for the Korean peninsula. The Chinese Government fully supports
                        the eight-point program for the peaceful unification of Korea put forward by
                        the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 12,
                        1971; declares that all foreign troops should withdraw from South Korea and
                        not be replaced by any other foreign forces; and states that the “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission for the Unification and
                        Rehabilitation of Korea” should be abolished. The U.S. side stated that <pb n="19" xml:id="d56-19" facs="d56-19"/>its relations with the Republic of
                        Korea were freely entered into by both sides and that existing commitments
                        would be honored. The U.S. would support all efforts of the Republic of
                        Korea to seek a relaxation of the tension and increased communication in the
                        Korean peninsula.</p>
                    <p>The United States and the People's Republic of China agreed to offer any
                        assistance to the two parties in Korea to reach a mutually acceptable
                        peaceful solution and to consult with interested parties with a view toward
                        replacing the 1953 armistice with an agreement formally ending
                        hostilities.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side expressed its firm opposition to the revival and outward
                        expansion of Japanese militarism, maintained that the United States should
                        withdraw all its troops and all its nuclear and military bases from Japan
                        and held that an independent, democratic, peaceful and neutral Japan may
                        have such armed forces as are necessary for its self-defense. The U.S. side
                        stated that it placed the highest value on its friendly relations with Japan
                        and that it would continue to honor its mutual defense treaty obligations.
                        It was pointed out that these arrangements contribute effectively to the
                        common goal of preventing a resurgence of traditional conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Both sides agreed that Japan is of cardinal importance to peace in Asia and
                        that niether side should try to complicate the other side's <pb n="20" xml:id="d56-20" facs="d56-20"/>efforts to improve relations with
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the two countries expressed deep concern over the tension in
                        the south Asian subcontinent and took the position that an armed conflict
                        would be disastrous for the peoples of the area. The two sides therefore
                        urged India and Pakistan to resolve their differences through peaceful
                        negotiations. All attempts to disturb peace, use armed force, or interfere
                        in another country's internal affairs are contrary to the interests of the
                        people of this region, and should be condemned.</p>
                    <p>The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious dispute between China and
                        the United States regarding Taiwan. The Chinese side reaffirmed its
                        position: The Taiwan question is the crucial question obstructing the
                        normalization of relations between the two countries; the Government of the
                        People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government in China; Taiwan is
                        a part of Chinese territory which has long been returned to the motherland;
                        the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair in which no other
                        country has the right to interfere; and the U.S. troops must withdraw from
                        Taiwan. The Chinese Government firmly opposes any activities which aim at
                        the creation of “one China, one Taiwan,” “one China, two governments,” “two
                        Chinas,” and “independent Taiwan” or advocate that “the status of Taiwan
                        remains to be determined.”</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side stated that the U.S. acknowledges that all Chinese on either
                        side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China. The <pb n="21" xml:id="d56-21" facs="d56-21"/>United States Government does not
                        challenge that position. It will support efforts to reach an equitable and
                        peaceful resolution of the ultimate relationship of Taiwan to the mainland.
                        With respect to the U.S. military presence on Taiwan, the U.S. side stated
                        that the U.S. forces would be progressively reduced as tensions in Asia
                        diminished. This would be done without the abandonment of United States
                        interest in a peaceful solution.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that pending the normalization of relations between the
                        two countries, the governments of the two countries would respectively take
                        measures to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two peoples and
                        their contacts in the scientific, technical, journalistic and cultural
                        fields.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that the U.S. Government will send a senior
                        representative to Peking at irregular intervals for concrete consultations
                        to further the normalization of relations and carry forward negotiations on
                        outstanding issues of common interest.</p>
                    <p>The two sides were gratified to have this opportunity, after so many years
                        without contact between the leaders of their two countries, to present
                        frankly to one another their respective views on a variety of issues. The
                        two sides expressed the hope that the gains achieved during this visit would
                        open up new prospects for the relations between the two countries. They
                        believe that normalization of relations between the two countries is not
                        only in the interest of the Chinese and American peoples but also
                        contributes to the relaxation of tension in Asia and the world.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his party visited
                        Peking and viewed cultural, industrial and agricultural sites, and they also
                        toured __________ and _________ where they, continuing discussions with
                        Chinese leaders, viewed similar places of interest.</p>
                    <p>During their meetings and talks, the leaders of China and the United States
                        reviewed the international situation in which important changes are taking
                        place and great upheavals exist and expounded their respective
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side stated that wherever there is oppression, there is
                        resistance. Countries want independence, nations want liberation and the
                        people want to make revolution —- this has become the irresistible trend of
                        history. It must be recognized that the people of all countries have the
                        right to choose their social systems according to their own wishes and
                        settle the affairs of their respective countries as independent and
                        sovereign nations. All progressive actions which are in the interest of the
                        people of one's own country and are supported by the people deserve sympathy
                        and support and absolutely permit of no foreign intervention. All nations,
                        big or small, should be equal; big nations should not bully the small and
                        strong nations should not bully the weak. China will never be a superpower
                        and it opposes hegemony and power politics of any kind. The Chinese side
                        stated that it firmly supports the struggles of all the oppressed people and
                        nations for freedom and liberation and firmly supports the peoples'
                        struggles to safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial
                        integrity of their own countries and oppose foreign aggression,
                        interference, control and subversion. All foreign troops should be withdrawn
                        to their own countries. The Chinese side strongly expressed its firm support
                        to the seven-point proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Viet Nan
                        question put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Govern- ment of the
                        Republic of South Viet Nam and the Joint Declaration of the Summit
                        Conference of the Indochinese Peoples and its determination to support to
                        the end the struggle of the peoples of Viet Nan, Lees and Cambodia for the
                        attainment of their goal; it firmly supports the eight-point programme for
                        the peaceful unification of Korea put forward by the Government of the
                        Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 12, 1971 and the stand for
                        the abolition of the “U.N. Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation
                        of Korea”; it firmly cpposes the revival and outward expansion of Japanese
                        militarism and firmly supports the Japanese people in their just struggle to
                        build an independent, democratic, peaceful and neutral Japan; it firmly
                        opposes anyone exploiting the situation in East Pakistan to interfere in
                        Pakistan's internal affairs, provoke armed conflicts and undermine peace in
                        the south Asian sub-continent.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side stated that peace in Asia and peace in the world required
                        efforts both to reduce immediate tensions and to eliminate the basic causes
                        of conflict. The U.S. side believes that the effort to reduce tension is
                        served by improving communication between countries that have different
                        world outlooks so as to lessen the risks of confrontation through accident,
                        miscalculation or misunderstanding. No country should claim infallibility
                        and each country should be prepared to re-examine its own attitudes for the
                        common good. The U.S. side believes that the effort to erase the fundamental
                        scurces of conflict is served by building a just and secure peace, just
                        because it fulfills the aspirations of peoples and nations for freedom and
                        progress, secure because it removes the danger of foreign aggression. The
                        U.S. supports individual freedom and social progress for all the peoples of
                        the world, free of outside pressure or intervention. The U.S. side stated
                        that the peoples of Indochina should be allowed to determine their destiny
                        without outside intervention; and that in the absence of a negotiated
                        settlement it envisaged the ultimate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the
                        region consistent with the aim of true self-determination for each country
                        of Indochina. The relations between the United States and the Republic of
                        Korea were freely entered into by both sides and the existing commitments
                        would be honored. The U.S. would support all efforts of the Republic of
                        Korea to seek a relaxation of the tension and increased communication in the
                        Korean peninsula. The U.S. placed the highest value on its friendly
                        relations with Japan and it would continue to honor its mutual defense
                        treaty obligations. The U.S. urged India and Pakistan to resolve their
                        differences through peaceful negotiations; all attempts to disturb peace,
                        use armed force or interfere in another country's internal affairs are
                        contrary to the interests of the people of this region and should be
                        condemned.</p>
                    <p>There are essential differences between China and the United States in their
                        social systems and foreign policies. However, the two, sides agreed that
                        relations between states should be conduoted on the principles of respect
                        for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression
                        against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other
                        states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. International
                        disputes should be settled on this basis, without resorting to the use or
                        threat of force. It would be against the interests of, the peoples of the
                        world for any major country to collude with another against other countries,
                        or to behave in such a war as to suggest that it had an exclusive sphere of
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>With these principles of international relations in mind the two sides stated
                        that:</p>
                    <p>— progress toward the normalization of relations between China and the United
                        States is in the interests of all countries;</p>
                    <p>— neither seeks hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to
                        efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such
                        hegemony; and</p>
                    <p>— neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to enter
                        into agreements or understandings directed at other states.</p>
                    <p>The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious disputes between China and
                        the United States. The Chinese side reaffirmed its position: The Taiwan
                        question is the crucial question obstructing the normalization of relations
                        between the two countries; the Government of the People's Republic of China
                        is the sole legal Government of China; Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory
                        which has long been returned to the motherland; the liberation of Taiwan is
                        China's internal affair in which no other country has the right to
                        interfere; and the U.S. troops must withdraw from Taiwan. The Chinese
                        Government firmly opposes any activities which aim at the creation of “one
                        Chinas one Taiwan”, “one China, two governments”, “two Chinas”, an
                        “independent Taiwan” or advocate that “the status of Taiwan remains to be
                        determined”. The U.S. side stated: The United States acknowledges that all
                        Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one
                        China; the United States Government does not challenge that position. The
                        United States will support the settlement of the question of the unification
                        of Taiwan and the mainland through peaceful negotiations and will not carry
                        out any activities aimed at separating Taiwan from China. The United States
                        will withdraw its troops and military installations in Taiwan after it has
                        completed the withdrawal of all the U.S. armed forces from Indochina.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that pending the normalization of relations between the
                        two countries, the Governments of the two countries would respectively take
                        measures to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two peoples and
                        their contacts in the scientific, technical, journalistic and cultural
                        fields.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that the U.S. Government will send a senior
                        representative to Peking at irregular intervals for concrete consultations
                        to further the normalization of relations and carry forward negotiations on
                        issues of common interest.</p>
                    <p>The two sides were gratified to have this opportunity, after so many years
                        without contact between the leaders of their two countries, to present
                        frankly to one another their respective views on a variety of issues. The
                        two sides expressed the hope that the gains achieved during this visit would
                        open up new prospects for the relations between the two countries. They
                        believe that the normalization of relations between the <pb n="22" xml:id="d56-22" facs="d56-22"/>two countries is not only in the interest
                        of the Chinese and American peoples but also contributes to the relaxation
                        of tension in Asia and the world.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his party
                        expressed their appreciation for the gracious hospitality shown them by the

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> of the United
                        States of America visited the People's Republic of China at the invitation

                        ____________, 1972. Accompanying the President on his visit were (Mrs.

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met with Chairman

                        conversation for ________ hours and had an exchange of views on Sino-U.S.
                        relations and world affairs.</p>
                    <p>During the visit, further talks were held between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier Chou En-lai. The two
                        sides held extensive, earnest and frank discussions on the normalization of
                        relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of

                        Chinese leaders, viewed similar places of interest.</p>
                    <p>During their meetings and talks, the leaders of China and the United States
                        reviewed the international situation in which important changes are taking
                        place and great upheavals exist and expounded their respective
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side stated that wherever there is oppression, there is
                        resistance. Countries want independence, nations want liberation and the
                        people want progress—this has become the irresistible trend of history. It
                        must be recognized that the people of all countries have the right to choose
                        their social systems according to their own wishes and settle the affairs of
                        their respective countries as independent and sovereign nations. All
                        nations, big or small, should be equal; big nations should not <pb n="25" xml:id="d56-25" facs="d56-25"/>bully the small and strong nations should
                        not bully the weak. China will never be a superpower and it opposes hegemony
                        and power politics of any kind. All foreign troops should be withdrawn to
                        their own country. The Chinese side strongly expressed its firm support to
                        the seven-point proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Viet Nam
                        question put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the

                        Conference of the Indochinese Peoples; it firmly supports the eight-point
                        programme for the peaceful unification of Korea put forward by the
                        Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 12, 1971,
                        and the stand for the abolition of the <pb n="26" xml:id="d56-26" facs="d56-26"/>“U.N. Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation
                        of Korea”; it firmly opposes the revival and outward expansion of Japanese
                        militarism and firmly advocates an independent, democratic, peaceful and
                        neutral Japan; it firmly opposes anyone exploiting the situation in East
                        Pakistan to interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs, provoke armed
                        conflicts and undermine peace in the Asian subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side stated that peace in Asia and peace in the world required
                        efforts both to reduce immediate tensions and to eliminate the basic causes
                        of conflict. Countries should treat each other with mutual respect and with
                        a willingness to compete peacefully, letting performance be the ultimate
                        judge. No country should claim infallibility and each country should be
                        prepared to re-examine its own attitudes for the common good. The U.S. side
                        desires to work with others to build a just and secure peace: just because
                        it fulfills the aspirations of peoples and nations for freedom and progress,
                        secure because it removes the danger of foreign aggression. <pb n="27" xml:id="d56-27" facs="d56-27"/>The U.S. supports individual freedom and
                        social progress for all the peoples of the world, free of outside pressure
                        or intervention. The U.S. side stated that the peoples of Indochina should
                        be allowed to determine their destiny without outside intervention; that its
                        constant primary objective has been a negotiated solution of the Indochina
                        conflict to which end it had made a series of proposals; and that in the
                        absence of a negotiated settlement it envisaged the ultimate withdrawal of
                        all U.S. forces from the region consistent with the aim of true
                        self-determination for each country of Indochina. The relations between the
                        United States and the Republic of Korea were freely entered into by both
                        sides and the existing commitments would be honored. The U.S. would support
                        all efforts of the Republic of Korea to seek a relaxation of the tension and
                        increased communication in the Korean peninsula. The U.S. placed the highest
                        value on its friendly relations with Japan and it would continue to honor
                        its mutual defense treaty obligations. The U.S. urged India and Pakistan to
                        resolve their differences through peaceful negotiations; all attempts to use

                        of the people of this region.</p>
                    <p>There are essential differences between China and the United States in their
                        social systems and foreign policies. <pb n="28" xml:id="d56-28" facs="d56-28"/>However, the two sides agreed that countries,
                        irrespective of their social systems, have a common interest in working
                        toward a resolution of international differences in the interest of all
                        mankind. They further agreed that relations between states should be
                        conducted on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial
                        integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
                        non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and
                        mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. International disputes should be
                        settled on this basis, without resorting to the use or threat of force. The
                        U.S. and the People's Republic of China are prepared to apply these
                        principles to their own relationships.</p>
                    <p>It would be against the interests of the peoples of the world for any major
                        country to collude with another against other countries, or to behave in

                    <p>With these principles of international relations in mind the two sides stated
                        that:</p>
                    <p>— both wish to reduce the danger of military conflict;</p>

                    <p>— neither seeks hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to
                        efforts by any other country or, group of countries to establish such
                        hegemony; and</p>
                    <p>— neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to enter

                    <p>The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious disputes between China and
                        the United States. The Chinese side reaffirmed its position: The Taiwan
                        question is the crucial question obstructing the normalization of relations
                        between the two countries; the Government of the People's Republic of China
                        is the sole legal Government of China; Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory
                        which has long been returned to the motherland; the liberation of Taiwan is
                        China's internal affair in which no other country has the right to
                        interfere; and the U.S. troops must withdraw from Taiwan. The Chinese
                        Government firmly opposes any activities which aim at the creation of “one
                        China, one Taiwan”, “one China, two governments”, “two Chinas”, an
                        “independent Taiwan” or advocate that"the status of Taiwan remains to be
                        determined.”</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side stated: The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on
                        either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China. The
                        United States Government does not challenge that position. It will support
                        efforts to reach [an equitable and] peaceful resolution of the ultimate
                        relationship of Taiwan to the mainland. With respect to the U.S. military
                        presence on Taiwan, the U.S. side stated that the U.S. forces would be
                        progressively reduced as tensions in Asia diminished. This would be done
                        without the abandonment of United States interest in a peaceful
                        solution.</p>

                    <p>The two sides agreed that pending the normalization of relations between the
                        two countries, the Governments of the two countries would respectively take
                        measures to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two peoples and

                        fields.</p>
                    <p>The two sides agreed that the U.S. Government will send a senior

                        for further the normalization of relations and carry forward negotiations on
                        issues of common interest.</p>
                    <p>The two sides were gratified to have this opportunity, after so many years

                        open up new prospects for the relations between the two countries. They
                        believe that the normalization of relations between the two countries is not
                        only in the interest of the Chinese <pb n="31" xml:id="d56-31" facs="d56-31"/>and American peoples but also contributes to the relaxation of tension in

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> of the United
                        States of America visited the People's Republic of China at the invitation

                    <p>During the visit, further talks were held between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier Chou En-lai. The two

                    <pb n="33" xml:id="d56-33" facs="d56-33"/>
                    <p>During their meetings and talks, the leaders of China and the United States
                        reviewed the international situation in which important changes are taking
                        place and great upheavals exist and expounded their respective positions and
                        views.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side stated that wherever there is oppression, there is
                        resistance. Countries want independence, nations want liberation and the
                        people want progress —- this has become the irresistible trend of history.
                        It must be recognized that the people of all countries have the right to
                        choose their social systems according to their own wishes and settle the
                        affairs of their respective countries as independent and sovereign nations,
                        and any foreign intervention is absolutely impermissible. All nations, big
                        or small, should be equal; big nations should not bully the small and strong
                        nations should not bully the weak. China will never be a superpower and it
                        opposes hegemony and power politics of any kind. The Chinese side stated
                        that it firmly supports the struggles of all the oppressed people and
                        nations for freedom and liberation and firmly supports the peoples' right to
                        safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of their
                        own countries and oppose foreign aggression, interference, control and
                        subversion. All foreign troops should be withdrawn to their own countries.
                        The Chinese side expressed its firm support to the struggle of the peoples
                        of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia for the attainment of their goal and its firm
                        support to the seven-point proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Viet
                        Nam question put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the
                        Republic of South Viet Nam and the Joint Declaration of the Summit
                        Conference of the Indochinese Peoples; it firmly supports the eight-point
                        programme for the peaceful unification of Korea put forward by the
                        Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 12, 1971
                        and the stand for the abolition of the “U.N. <pb n="34" xml:id="d56-34" facs="d56-34"/>Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of
                        Korea”; it firmly opposes the revival and outward expansion of Japanese
                        militarism and firmly supports the Japanese people's desire to build an
                        independent, democratic, peaceful and neutral Japan; it firmly opposes
                        anyone exploiting the situation in East Pakistan to interfere in Pakistan's
                        internal affairs, provoke armed conflicts and undermine peace in the Asian
                        sub-continent.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side stated that peace in Asia and peace in the world required
                        efforts both to reduce immediate tensions and to eliminate the basic causes
                        of conflict. The U.S. side believes that the effort to reduce tension is
                        served by improving communication between countries that have different
                        world outlooks so as to lessen the risks of confrontation through accident,
                        miscalculation or misunderstanding. Countries should treat each other with
                        mutual respect and with a willingness to compete peacefully, letting
                        performance be the ultimate judge. No country should claim infallibility and
                        each country should be prepared to re-examine its own attitudes for the
                        common good. The U.S. side desires to work with others to build a just and
                        secure peace: just because it fulfills the aspirations of peoples and
                        nations for freedom and progress, secure because it removes the danger of
                        foreign aggression. The United States supports individual freedom and social
                        progress for all the peoples of the world, free of outside pressure or
                        intervention. The U.S. side stated that the peoples of Indochina should be
                        allowed to determine their destiny without outside intervention; that its
                        constant primary objective has been a negotiated solutiont of the Indochina
                        conflict to which and it had made a series of proposals, and that in the
                        absence of a negotiated settlement it envisaged the ultimate withdrawal, of
                        all U.S. <pb n="35" xml:id="d56-35" facs="d56-35"/>forces from the region
                        consistent with, the aim of true self-determination for each country of
                        Indochina. The United States would support all efforts of the Republic of
                        Korea to seek a relaxation of the tension and increased communication in the
                        Korean peninsular. The United States placed the highest value on its
                        friendly relations with Japan and it would continua to honor its mutual
                        defense treaty obligations. The United States urged India and Pakistan to
                        resolve their differences through peaceful negotiations; all attempts to use
                        armed force to settle international problems are contrary to the interests
                        of the people of this region.</p>
                    <p>There are essential differences between China and the United States in their
                        social systems and foreign polioies. However, the two aides agreed that
                        countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their
                        relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial
                        integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
                        non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and
                        mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. International disputes should be
                        settled on this basis, without resorting to the use or threat of force. The
                        United States and the People's Republic of China are prepared to apply these
                        principles to their mutual relations.</p>

                        challenge that position; it hopes that the settlement of the Taiwan question
                        consistent with this position will be achieved through peaceful negotiations
                        and states that it will progressively reduce and finally withdraw all the

                    <p>The two sides were gratified to have this opportunity, after so many years
                        without contact between the leaders of their two countries, to present
                        frankly to one another their respective views on variety of <pb n="38" xml:id="d56-38" facs="d56-38"/>issues. The two sides expressed the hope
                        that the gains achieved during this visit would open up new prospects for
                        the relations between the two countries. They believe that the normalization
                        of relations between the two countries is not only in the interest of the
                        Chinese and American peoples but also contributes to the relaxation of
                        tension in Asia and the world.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his party
                        expressed their appreciation for the gracious hospitality shown them by the
                        Government and people of the People's Republic of China.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <p>On 31 October following the receipt of a telegram from Washington at midnight
                        (which I completed deciphering at 0330), I made arrangements to call on the
                        Chinese at 1800 (this time was suggested by them).</p>
                    <p>I went to their Embassy Residence at Boulevard du Chateau in Neuilly and was
                        received at the gate by Wei and at the door by Tsao who had told me that the
                        Ambassador would also be present and he joined us in the Red Room within two
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>I thanked him for coming since he had so much to do just prior to his
                        departure for Peking. He said that he was happy to meet with me since we
                        were working in the interest of both our countries and the peace of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>I then read the oral message in French and Wei translated it and read it in
                        English and Tsao copied it down.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that he would transmit it electrically at once and
                        also take a copy with him. He said he was very pleased that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would be coming with the President
                        and asked whether his daughters would also be coming. I said I had no
                        information on this. He then said that he was also pleased that the
                        President would be going to Hangchow. In China they had a saying that there
                        were two places worth seeing, “Heaven and Hangchow”.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said he had heard from the Chinese side
                        that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit had gone
                        well. He himself was returning to Peking for about 15 days and would be back
                        in Paris around Nov 15. He was taking Wei with him. It was a 23-hour trip
                        and he would be in Peking on Wednesday, Nov 3.</p>
                    <p>He said that it was both absurd and dangerous for 800 million Chinese and 200
                        million Americans to pretend that the others did not exist. What was being
                        done, if it worked out, was of long-term historic importance. He knew it had
                        not been easy for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to open
                        the dialogue, nor had it been easy for their side. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had been courageous. The Editor
                        (presumably Reston) of the New York Times might not think he was courageous
                        but they agreed with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName> that the President was courageous. I said that it was
                        fortunate that both sides had had courageous men at this time. He agreed. I
                        said I had seen President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> twice
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d57-03" facs="d57-03"/>in times of great stress and
                        danger (Lima and Caracas) and knew how calm he remained under such
                        circumstances. It was reassuring for the whole world. He nodded.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> also said it was fortunate that at this
                        time President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had had such a
                        wise counselor as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He
                        had seen him only a few times but he had made a most favorable impression on
                        him (Amb) for frankness, vision and directness.</p>
                    <p>He then recalled my original approach to the military Attache of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in April and said that the interpreter had
                        been very frightened at being approached by an American General. I had,
                        however, been discreet because I had spoken to him alone in the courtyard of
                        the Polish Embassy. The Ambassador added that the Chinese Military Attache
                        to Paris knew nothing about our meetings.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said that if our efforts bring results
                        all mankind will owe us a debt. There was a long tradition of friendship
                        between our countries and we must renew it. Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> said that he will report on this channel to
                        the Prime Minister and tell him about me. I had helped open a door that had
                        been closed for many years. He hoped I would visit China.</p>
                    <p>He then said that Tsao would be empowered to receive any letters or documents
                        but any discussions of substance should await his return. I would be
                        notified as soon as he returned.</p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing transpired over liters of jasmine tea, preserved apples
                        and two different types of pastries filled with small unmentionable objects
                        in an atmosphere of great cordiality.</p>
                    <p>Patted on the back and arm and called, “my friend”, I was escorted to the
                        door by Tsao and to the gate by Wei.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador was wearing a blue uniform and the other two were in
                        conventional Western clothes. None of them wore any of the usual red Mao
                        badges.</p>

                    <p>16 November 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <p>On November 15 I called Tsao at the Chinese Embassy. He seemed a little
                        startled and said he absolutely could not see me on Monday (15). I explained
                        that I merely wanted to leave a piece of paper for transmission and he then
                        agreed to see me at 0900 on November 16.</p>
                    <p>I went there at that time and was met by another Chinese diplomat. (Wei is in
                        Peking with the Ambassador. It is Wei's first trip home to see his family in
                        two and a half years.) This man's name is CHAN YUNG CHIEH. He speaks fluent
                        French but little or no English.</p>
                    <p>CHIEH met me at the gate (which was locked when I arrived and rang) and
                        ushered me into the house which looked like a wreck. The carpets were up and
                        they were moving furniture around.</p>
                    <p>Into the living room, jasmine tea and preserved apples and I handed Tsao the
                        message as instructed and told him of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s forthcoming visit and desire to see the
                        Ambassador. Tsao said he had had no word concerning the Ambassador's return
                        but he would return either on Wednesday, 17 November, in which case he could
                        see Dr. Kisssinger; if not then, he would not return until Sunday, 21
                        November, in which case it would be too late.</p>
                    <p>He then emphasized that he could not discuss substantial matters but would
                        transmit the paper I gave him to Peking at once by electrical means. He
                        seemed to think that answers on the third question (the President's press
                        conference) might be forthcoming by then but dubious about the others.</p>
                    <p>More tea and preserved apples and the usual ritual for departure.</p>

                    <p>[Attachment]</p>
                    <p>1. The arrival in New York of the Delegation of the Peoples Republic of China
                        to the United Nations raises the question of contacts between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side and that Delegation. Up to now, all of
                        our contacts have been with the Chinese representatives in Paris. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intends to use Paris as the primary channel
                        for communications on major and longer-range policy issues and sensitive
                        questions unless it receives a contrary view from Peking.</p>
                    <p>There will be, however, a number of policy issues arising in New York
                        requiring early decision on which a more rapid contact may be necessary than
                        would be possible through our arrangements in Paris. For example, there is
                        the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                        meeting on the situation in South Asia.</p>
                    <p>We do not wish to proceed on such a course without informally having
                        ascertained the Chinese view. The exchange of views on such issues would not
                        need to involve commitments but would assure understanding. For such issues,
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> proposes that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side meet secretly with whomever the Chinese side would
                        designate in New York. Absolute secrecy would be maintained. They would
                        discuss the basic issues and principles. Then they could decide whether more
                        formal discussions of procedures and specific steps would be necessary
                        between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> and the
                        members of the Chinese Delegation. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        side wishes for the time being that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remain the principal channel.</p>
                    <p>2. Aside from the United Nations question, the United States side would
                        appreciate the Chinese side's views on the situation in South Asia to be
                        sure <pb n="3" xml:id="d59-03" facs="d59-03"/>that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions are taken with the Chinese view in mind.</p>
                    <p>3. If the Chinese side agrees to the joint announcement of the date of the
                        President's visit on November 23 at 1600 hours Washington time, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side would like to be free to release some
                        additional information that evening at 1930 hours Washington time. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is thinking of holding a
                        press conference at that time and may be asked questions to which he would
                        like to respond as follows:</p>
                    <p>— The visit will last seven days.</p>
                    <p>— The President will visit Shanghai and Hangchow in addition to Peking.</p>
                    <p>— Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> will accompany the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>— The two sides are investigating possible arrangements for television and
                        other media coverage.</p>
                    <p>Does the Chinese side aqree that the President release this information in
                        response to questions.</p>

                    <p>18 November 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <p>On the morning of 18 November I proceeded by the usual circuitous route to
                        the vicinity of the Chinese Embassy Residence in Neuilly and walked the rest
                        of the way after parking the car some distance away.</p>
                    <p>I was met at the gate by Wei, at the door by Tsao and ushered into the “Red
                        Room.” The Ambassador came in and greeted me warmly. He said that he had
                        returned a week ahead of schedule to bring me some of the answers which we
                        had requested. I said I was sorry he had had to return early from his
                        homeland. He said that what we were doing was important and he did not mind.
                        He said he had had a good trip but 24 hours in a plane was long. He had
                        returned via Rangoon, Karachi and Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then said that while he was home he had
                        had echoes of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s most
                        recent trip and everyone was pleased.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then directed Tsao to read the following to me in English:</p>
                    <p>“The Chinese side has received the U.S. messages of October 30 and October 31
                        and hereby makes the following replies:</p>
                    <p>1. The Chinese side proposes that the announcement already agreed upon by the
                        two sides on the date of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit be made at 0500, November 30, Tuesday, Peking
                        time. That is, 1600, November 29, Monday, Washington time.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chinese Government welcomes and invites Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to accompany the President on his
                        visit to China.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chinese Government will make arrangements for a 7-day visit and
                        overnight stay in Hangchow for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his party.”</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d60-02" facs="d60-02"/>
                    <p>I thanked them and said that this partially answered some of the contents of
                        the message I had for them.</p>
                    <p>I then delivered the message covering the postponement of the Vietnamese
                        meeting and consequent postponement of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s trip to Paris. The Ambassador noted that some of
                        the questions had already been answered by his message. He asked when would
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> come to Paris. I said
                        that I did not know but that this would depend on the North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>He then said that he would tell me the real reason why the Chinese would
                        prefer to move the date of the announcement of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to the 29th instead of the
                        23rd. At that time they would have a Chief of Government of a neighboring
                        state visiting them and they did not feel it would be opportune to make such
                        an announcement during his stay in China. I said that if I were a guessing
                        man I could guess what country was involved. The Ambassador asked which one
                        I would guess and I said, “North Vietnam.” He slapped me on the back and
                        said, “You guessed right the first time. He will leave China on the 26th;
                        therefore, the announcement on the 29th suits us best.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said he was pleased the President would
                        travel in a Chinese plane and said the Prime Minister had told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that he (P.M. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou EN-LAI</persName>) would accompany the President
                        and thus security was guaranteed. He then asked if the President often flew
                        in non-American planes. I said that to the best of my knowledge, he had not,
                        nor had any of his predecessors. I had made every single foreign trip with
                        President Eisenhower and two trips with President Truman and as far as I
                        knew, none of them had ever travelled in a foreign plane. He looked as
                        pleased as a Cheshire cat.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said I was an old friend and he had not seen me in a long time
                        and had set aside the morning for me. I was then served large quantities of
                        Chinese food some of which looked like chopped unmentionables wrapped in the
                        gall bladders of sheep, but maybe that was my imagination. I was also served
                        'Peking lightening,' a beverage called MAI TAI that could easily replace
                        lighter fluid.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d60-03" facs="d60-03"/>
                    <p>When I would not take more than a small amount alleging that I had to drive
                        my car, he commented that Russians drink a lot. I then said that there was a
                        story going around about Khrushchev's visit to President Eisenhower.
                        Reportedly Eisenhower asked Khrushchev what he thought about the U. S.
                        Khrushchev said it was okay but there were lots of drunkards. Eisenhower was
                        indignant, opened his desk, took out a pistol, and gave it to Khrushchev
                        saying, “You have my permission to shoot any drunkards you see.” Next day in
                        New York Khrushchev went for a walk, saw a drunkard and shot him; later he
                        shot another - in all, four. Next morning the New York Newspapers came out
                        with huge headlines, “Four Soviet Diplomats Mysteriously Shot.” The
                        Ambassador laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and Wei and Tsao were
                        equally transported.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then asked if I was going to China with the President, not as
                        interpreter but as member of his staff, or was I going on the next trip. I
                        said I would like to go but really did not know. He then replied that he had
                        told them in Peking about me and how I had helped open the door that had
                        been closed for 25 years and he would talk to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> when he saw him about it. First,
                        he would soften him up with a Chinese lunch as he understood Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was a great lover of Chinese
                        food. (I'm sorry, but he did say all this). During this time I was eating
                        fried shrimp in soy bean sauce in the service of my country. I have only
                        eaten shrimp one other time, also with the Ambassador and in the same Red
                        Room!</p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing was washed down with jasmine tea and accompanied by the
                        now usual friendly pats on the arm and back. I then took my leave in accord
                        with the usual ceremonial. They said that as soon as they had anything for
                        me they would be in touch.</p>
                    <p>Left the Ambassador in the Red Room, Tsao at the door and Wei at the garden
                        gate. It was perhaps the most cordial and relaxed interview I had with the
                        Ambassador.</p>

                        received. Their Number One is back. He stated that the Chinese strongly
                        prefer 29 November rather than 23 November for announcement. They explained
                        that the problem involved the fact that they will have a visitor from Hanoi
                        in Peking on the 23d and, therefore, hope that we can make the announcement
                        on the 29th.</p>
                    <p>There were no answers on additional details and no indication of when they
                        would have such an answer. However, they expressed great gratitude that the
                        U.S. side had agreed to the seven-day trip. They expressed pleasure that the
                        First Lady would come and that the President will travel in their aircraft.
                        The Chinese Ambassador was also anxious to know when he could see you and
                        Walters indicated that this depended on the North Vietnamese.</p>

                    <p>Dear Dick:</p>
                    <p>Enclosed are two messages you should hand to the Chinese Ambassador during
                        your meeting on Saturday, November 20, 1971. The first message is a note
                        concerning the announcement of the date for the President's visit. The
                        second is a personal communication from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou

                        time for the agreed announcement of the date for the President's visit.</p>
                    <p>The President is holding a press conference on November 30 at 2000 Pacific
                        time (2300 Washington time) at which time he would like to be able to
                        respond to questions by releasing the additional information on the visit
                        contained in the U.S. note delivered on November 16, 1971. If the Chinese
                        side agrees that this additional information can be made known, the U.S.
                        side would be grateful if the Chinese side would similarly defer its public
                        release until November 30 at 2300 Washington time.</p>

                    <p>In view of the fact that a North Vietnamese delegation is shortly visiting
                        Peking, I would like to put forward some comments on the present negotiating
                        situation against the background of our discussions in Peking.</p>
                    <p>The United States government is taking seriously your views that Indochina is
                        an urgent issue for the relaxation of tensions in the Far East and it would
                        help to have this issue substantially settled before the President's visit
                        to the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>On October 11, 1971 the United States presented to North Vietnam a new
                        comprehensive proposal designed to bring a rapid end to the war on a basis
                        just for all parties. While it would not be appropriate for us to give you
                        the details of this proposal, you should know that it provides for the total
                        withdrawal of American forces which you have urged upon us, as well as the
                        maximum suggestions that we can make on the political issue.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side proposed a private meeting on November 1, 1971 between me and
                            <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName>, or any other
                        appropriate representative of the political leadership in Hanoi, together
                        with <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName>. On October 25, 1971
                        the North Vietnamese side said that <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName> would
                        he willing to meet with me on November 20, 1971. The U.S. side accepted this
                        later date.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d62-04" facs="d62-04"/>
                    <p>On November 17, 1971—or three days before the scheduled meeting and after all
                        arrangements for a secret visit to Paris had been made—the North Vietnamese
                        informed us that Le Due Tho had suddenly become ill and could not attend the
                        meeting. On November 19, 1971 we informed the North Vietnamese that under
                        these circumstances I would not be travelling to Paris; that we remained
                        ready to meet with <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName>, or any
                        other appropriate representative of the political leadership in Hanoi,
                        together with Xuan Thuy; and that we would wait to hear North Vietnamese
                        suggestions for a new date.</p>
                    <p>As I told you and Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh
                            Chien-ying</persName>, and as we have made clear to the North
                        Vietnamese, the United States is prepared to treat North. Vietnamese
                        concerns with generosity. At the same time, the People's Republic of China,
                        as a great country, will recognize that we cannot permit ourselves to be
                        humiliated, no matter what the possible consequences for other policies.</p>
                    <p>We know that the People's Republic, like the United States, does not trade in
                        principles. We have no specific request to make, and we do not expect an
                        answer to this communication. I am sending you this message to keep you
                        informed of major developments as President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit draws closer and in the spirit of candor which
                        has marked our conversations.</p>

                    <p>20 November 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:</p>
                    <p>Having received instructions to seek a meeting with the Chinese on the
                        morning of 20 November, 1971. I called Tsao on the evening before and made
                        arrangements to see them at 1130 on Saturday the 20th. At that time I went
                        there and was met and escorted into the Red Room in accordance with the
                        usual ritual. The Ambassador, Wei and Tsao were present. This was my 22nd
                        meeting with them.</p>
                    <p>I said that I had not expected to see them so soon after our last meeting but
                        I had received two messages for them. The Ambassador replied that he also
                        had a message for me but that as I was their guest I should transmit mine
                        first I then read the message referring to our desire to release certain
                        facts about the tr[ip] at the President's press conference on the 30th of
                        November and giving our agreement their proposed date and time of release.
                        Then I handed the English text of the message to Tsao as instructed in your
                        letter of transmittal.</p>
                    <p>I then read the text of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s message to the Prime Minister in French, sentence by
                        sentence, and Wei translated it into Chinese. I then handed it to Tsao and
                        he read from the English text and also translated it into Chinese for the
                        Ambassador. He made no comment other than to ask what the meaning on
                        “regarding of effect it might have on other policies.” I replied that it
                        meant what the text said and he nodded apparently satisfied. He then said
                        “The Vietnamese notified you of <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName>'s illness only three days before the scheduled meeting /”
                        I replied that that was quite correct. He nodded ruefully and grinned. Tsao
                        then asked for clarification of some English expressions of which he was not
                        sure and I gave it in English to him and repeated it for Wei in French to
                        make sure that there were no misunderstandings of any part of the text.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that he had learned that the U.S. had made excellent
                        arrangements for the Chinese delegation to the United Nations and that they
                        were pleased. He realized that we had local difficulties such as when Mayor
                        Lindsay had refused to welcome Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>, but that nothing like that had happened with the
                        Chinese delegation.</p>
                    <p>He then instructed Tsao to hand me the text of their message after first
                        reading it in English. (This is the first time they have ever given me a
                        paper to keep and transmit.). I am enclosing the text of this document.</p>
                    <p>After it had been read and handed to me Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        She then said that he believed that they had answered all of our questions
                        and as of that moment he did not owe me any answers. They had given us their
                        view regarding communication in New York, regarding the situation in South
                        Asia and their agreement for the date of the announcement of President's
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, and the release of the
                        additional material on facts which we wished to make public at the
                        President's Press conference. I said that seemed to me that the books were
                        on balance between us as of that time.</p>
                    <p>All of this was interspersed with floods of Jasmine tea, platefuls of chopped
                        nuts, preserved apples and two types of little pies containing unknown
                        chopped materials. Mai Tai (Chinese Lightening) was also brought in and
                        using my excuse that I had to drive, I took as little as possible. I had
                        already taken the precaution of taking a glass of olive oil before going
                        there to coat my stomach and limit the effects of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s culinary and alcoholic revenge. Avery slight fragrance
                        of incense drifted through the Red Room (first time I have had any, but it
                        was much less than for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.)</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d63-02" facs="d63-02"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador then asked bluntly whether I also dealt with messages for the
                        North Vietnamese. I said that I did but only transmitted and received
                        messages. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> did the
                        talking but I was present. He laughed and said “you fight on many fronts at
                        once.” I agreed.</p>
                    <p>We then talked about the racial situation in the United States and I
                        mentioned casually that my Air Attache was an Abenaki Indian and that the
                        Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in Europe Maj. Gen Davison was black
                        as was the Ambassador Sweden. He said “You are on tbe right road.” There was
                        more light chit chat and historical persiflage of this type and after an
                        hour I was released to go.</p>
                    <p>My departure took place in accord with the usual ritual and ceremonia [text
                        illegible] The Ambassador, Tsao and Wei could not have been more cordial and
                        seemed more relaxed at any time since I have been seeing them.</p>

                            internal affairs,” and offered Chinese military and political support
                            for Pakistan, in the event of an attack.</note>

                    <p>11/20/71</p>
                    <p>1. The Chinese side agrees that while Paris remains the primary channel, the
                        Chinese and United states sides designate specific persons to contact each
                        other in New York, and proposes that the Vice-Chairman of the Delegation of
                        the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> for the Chinese side meet with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>“The Chinese side's understanding is that such meetings should only be for
                        exchanges of views on relevant major questions of principle within the scope
                        of the work of the United Nations and would not need to involve commitments
                        and, moreover, they would not be made public and secrecy would be maintained
                        by both sides. As for the concrete arrangements for the meetings, please
                        contact Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> and work them
                        out directly with him.</p>
                    <p>“2. With regard to the Indian-Pakistan situation, India is at present
                        interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs and carrying out subversive
                        activities and military threats against Pakistan by continuing to exploit
                        the East Pakistan question. The Indian-Pakistan situation is aggravating
                        daily. The Chinese side maintains that the East Pakistan question is the
                        internal affair of Pakistan which brooks no foreign interference and that
                        disputes between countries should be settled between the two sides concerned
                        through consultation and not by resorting to force of arms. The proposal put
                        forward by President <persName corresp="#p_KAMY1">Yahya Khan</persName> for
                        the armed forces of India and Pakistan to withdraw from the border
                        respectively and disengage is helpful to the easing of tension in the
                        Sub-Continent and should be welcomed. Should Pakistan be subjected to
                        aggression by India, China will support the Pakistan Government and people
                        in their just struggle. China already made public its above stand during the
                        visit of the Pakistan Delegation to China. China has also agreed to continue
                        to provide military assistance.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d64-02" facs="d64-02"/>
                    <p>“It is hoped that the United States will exert its influence to prevent the
                        further deterioration of the situation through persuasion.</p>
                    <p>“3. The Chinese side has no objection to the release by the U.S. side of the
                        four points of information under item 3 in the U.S. message of November 16
                        with the understanding that it is agreeable to the U.S. side that the joint
                        announcement of the date of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China be made on November 29, Washington
                        time.”</p>

                    <p>You will see that the list boils down essentially to the following:</p>
                    <p>— A series of assurances on our Soviet policy, including equality of
                        treatment, meticulous debriefing, and deflection of pressures.</p>
                    <p>— Our various assurances on Taiwan policy, as reaffirmed by the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>— Other miscellaneous understandings, including coordination on South Asian
                        policy, restraint on Japan, confidentiality of our talks with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, and various travel/exchange matters in the
                        Watson channel.</p>
                    <p>If the President stated our intentions more than once, e.g., on certain
                        aspects of Taiwan policy, I have listed it in each case with a close

                    <p>THE WHITE HOUSE</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                    <p>November 22, 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> called me at home at
                        11:10 A. M. , Sunday, November 21, saying that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had instructed me to call
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> directly. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> said he would inquire of
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> whether we knew of a
                        private line for the Ambassador and then call me back.</p>
                    <p>At 11:55 A. M. General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> said
                        that we knew of no private line and that I should therefore call the Hotel
                        Roosevelt in New York City directly. I immediately placed the call to the
                        Ambassador and the hotel switchboard put me directly through to the Chinese
                        delegation. An unidentified Chinese man who spoke serviceable English was on
                        the line and I gave him my name and asked to speak to the Ambassador. He
                        said that he would have to check, and after about 30 seconds he came back on
                        the line to say that the Ambassador was not there and would be out for “some
                        time'” that afternoon. I repeated my name and asked the Ambassador to call
                        me back at my office number (202-456-2255).</p>
                    <p>When the Ambassador had not called by 6:00 P. M. , I once again called the
                        Roosevelt Hotel, this time from the office. I asked for the Ambassador if he
                        had returned, and,in his absence,Miss Tang. There were two false starts:
                        first, the hotel operator gave me the Chinese press relations office which
                        then switched me to another number on the delegation; secondly, when I
                        reached an unidentified member of the delegation, after checking briefly, he
                        tried to switch me to the Ambassador's number and we were cut off. After
                        reaching the same man again he switched me successfully to the Ambassador's
                        extension (his room is 1412).</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador answered the phone himself. I gave my name and mentioned that
                        we had met in July. The Ambassador immediately recognized me. I then
                        explained that “my superior” would have called the Ambassador normally, but
                        that he thought my calling would be “less conspicuous.” Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> commented, “Good.” I then said that my
                        superior had a message for the Ambassador which he wished to get to him
                        directly on Monday afternoon. I said that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>, whom he had not met <pb n="2" xml:id="d66-02" facs="d66-02"/>but whom others on his delegation had
                        met, would carry the message. I asked the best way for Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> to get the message to him directly.
                        The Ambassador inquired what time we wished to deliver the message, and I
                        replied any time that was convenient for him during the afternoon. He then
                        suggested 2:00 P.M. and said that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> should come directly to the 14th floor. He would be met
                        by Miss Tang and brought to the Ambassador (presumably his room, 1412). I
                        said that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> would wait
                        as long as necessary to bring back</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador was cordial, did not seem at all surprised to hear from us,
                        and spoke in rather halting English.</p>

                    <p>When the elevator door opened on the 14th floor at 2:00 p.m. Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> was greeted by Miss Wang
                        Hai-jung, who he had met in Peking and who now was a member of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> delegation. Miss Tang Wen-sheng, who had
                        acted as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s interpreter,
                        was close at hand and the two of them escorted him to a small reception room
                        some distance down the corridor to the left. Miss Wang Hai-jung soon excused
                        herself to inform the Ambassador and she did not return. Miss Tang and
                        Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> engaged in light
                        repartee which she began by saying “who would have thought that we would
                        meet again so soon and here in New York.” Among other things she mentioned
                        that she thought New York had changed a lot but cautioned that her
                        recollection was not precise since she had been in primary school when she
                        left the United States. She also inquired whether Dianne Matthews had
                        received a box left in Peking behind a door in her room which had been
                        returned via Paris. In response to Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>'s inquiry she said they didn't know what was in the box
                        because they hadn't opened it. (Dianne says the package contained tea cups
                        and that General Walters has it in hand.) During this period tea and light
                        snacks were served.</p>
                    <p>In a few minutes the Ambassador entered and, after an exchange of
                        pleasantries Commander Howe handed him the attached note. The Ambassador and
                        Miss Tang read the note together with the latter translating at a few
                        places. After very little further conversation between them, the interpreter
                        stated that Monday night would be difficult because the Ambassador had been
                        invited to a National Day reception for another country. Tuesday would be
                        much better. Since they were giving a reception of their own between 7 and 9
                        p.m., the meeting should be set for <pb n="2" xml:id="d67-02" facs="d67-02"/>10 p.m. (It seemed obvious from the precision of their reply that they had
                        anticipated the Tuesday time problem and had already decided on lO p.m.)
                        Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> accepted this time
                        without further discussion except to reiterate that Tuesday was also Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s preference.</p>
                    <p>Commander Howe gave them the address of the meeting place and explained that
                        Apartment 1B was one flight up and that someone would be at the curb to
                        bring them to the apartment. He also indicated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be waiting in the
                        apartment. Miss Tang asked how the house could be identified. Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> apologized for not
                        personally having seen the house and explained that it was not in an
                        affluent area but had been selected primarily to insure privacy. He stated
                        that the dwelling would be numbered and that someone would be on the lookout
                        for them. Miss Tang seemed a little concerned about whether a familiar face
                        would be there to meet them, so Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> told her that Winston Lord would be at the entrance and
                        would greet them as soon as their car opened. He added that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> might not be conspicuous but that as
                        soon as they had stopped, he would appear. This seemed to reassure her. She
                        assumed that they should come in their own car.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned to lighter topics. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> stated at an early point that he knew
                        the Ambassador was very busy and that he did not want to keep him. However,
                        the Ambassador seemed in no mood to end the meeting. The Ambassador remarked
                        that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> had recently
                        been in Peking and Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>
                        noted that those who had met the Ambassador in July had had many fine things
                        to say about him. The discussion touched on a number of topics including:
                        Chinese hospitality toward the U.S. party during the October trip to Peking,
                        places the U.S. party had visited in China, whether Commander Howe was
                        located in New York or had come to New York especially that day and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s whereabouts, the fact
                        that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be in
                        California with the President during the Thanksgiving period, and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> delegation had been very busy and
                        had not had a chance to get out of Manhattan, confining their travels mostly
                        to movement between the Hotel and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As the meeting was drawing to a close, the Ambassador asked that he be
                        contacted if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wished to
                        change the time for the meeting. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> assured him that this would be done, although he was
                        confident that the time was excellent from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s point of view and he did not foresee any reason
                        for change. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> said that
                        if the Ambassador needed to make a change he could use the telephone numbers
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> had given him on Sunday. The
                        Ambassador asked if <pb n="3" xml:id="d67-03" facs="d67-03"/>Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> had the hotel telephone
                        number and Commander Howe assured him that there would be no difficulty in
                        reaching the Ambassador if necessary.</p>
                    <p>In closing, the Ambassador asked that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> convey his personal regards to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> said that he would and that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> sent his very best
                        regards to the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador and Miss Tang then walked Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> to the elevator. (Miss Tang asked
                        that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> send her regards
                        to Dianne Matthews.)</p>
                    <p>During the course of the meeting there was no discussion of matters of
                        substance or relating to the President's trip, and no indication as to who
                        would be attending the Tuesday evening meeting.</p>
                    <p>Footnote on personalities</p>
                    <p>(As usual, the Chinese were gracious hosts and went out of their way to be
                        pleasant and personable. Miss Tang seemed a little less vivacious than when
                        interpreting for Chou. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                            Hua</persName> seemed at ease and deliberately prolonged the meeting but
                        was not as glib as some top ranking Chinese previously encountered.)</p>

                        again. I have the fondest recollections of my trips to Peking.</p>
                    <p>I apologize for this apartment. We had to improvise rapidly. We looked for an
                        apartment without a doorman. Next time we will have more adequate
                        surroundings.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It's better than a hotel.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d68-02" facs="d68-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would hate to believe
                        that. I hope you are showing courtesy.</p>
                    <p>It is a pleasure to see you all here. When I saw you in Peking, I thought I
                        might see you in many places, but not necessarily in New York.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We also thought that we would continue
                        to see each other in Peking, not in New York.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know whether I
                        can express personal sentiments to those from Communist countries or whether
                        everything is done on an objective basis. I did want to tell you that if
                        there is anything that we can do to make your stay, or that of your
                        delegation, more pleasant, you should get in touch with our office. We will
                        do what we can, and we would not consider it an official approach. Sometimes
                        there are technical problems. We will do anything we can to make your stay
                        more comfortable.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We thank you very much.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't have a State
                        Guest House.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It was comfortable?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Extremely
                        comfortable.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You went when it was hot the first
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Inside the Guest House
                        it was very comfortable.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: The second time you were there I was
                        no longer there. Otherwise I would have accompanied you to the Great Wall.
                        Mr. Ch'en Ch'u here did so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, he was there. He
                        is in some pictures with me.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: A lot of correspondents and newsmen
                        would like to accompany President Nixon on his trip.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We keep relative
                        discipline with the press by leaving the impression that we can take very
                        many if they can behave themselves. We have not told them yet the number
                        that the Prime Minister and I have agreed upon. We will try to keep that a
                        secret as long as possible.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d68-03" facs="d68-03"/>
                    <p>Ch'en Ch'u: Until the final minutes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The first time I
                        mentioned the approximate number to our regular contact, he said, “What, two
                        companies?”</p>
                    <p>I understand, Mr. Ambassador, that we can meet on matters within the general
                        scope of UN policy, and that we will keep our other channel for longer range
                        problems. Is that your understanding?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That's also my understanding.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, the general
                        scope of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problems is rather wide. If
                        sometime we have an urgent message,in order to get it back there quickly,
                        would it be appropriate to give it to you?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes, if they are within the scope of
                        principles with relation to matters of policy in the United Nations. As for
                        the time factor, we hope you will be able to tell us what you would like to
                        say as early as possible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Under normal
                        circumstances this would be very easy. I know what to discuss with you and
                        what to discuss elsewhere. Sometimes there are border-line areas where we
                        must act quickly. We can decide these case-by-case. I will approach you and
                        we will decide what to discuss if it is urgent.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will check with you
                        then. You and I will discuss general issues, the principal issues related to
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> business, and then the technical
                        discussions can be handled with others meeting as necessary. But you and I
                        will discuss them first and which way we should handle the issue.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We agree to that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> to write down the phone
                        numbers on which we can be reached. I think we should agree on a code name
                        for you. If you give your real name, every operator at the White House will
                        listen to the conversations. You can choose any name at all. Just say Mr. So
                        and So is calling.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d68-04" facs="d68-04"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We can discuss that later.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If she (indicating Miss
                        T'ang) calls me and gives a girl's name, they will pay no attention.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We were also considering that,
                        too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is a possibility.
                        Or, she could ask for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> or
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>.</p>
                    <p>When you were in Ottawa I got full reports from all my colleagues trying to
                        arrange trips for Presidential candidates to China. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) As far as I can tell, you behaved
                        with Oriental inscrutability.</p>
                    <p>If I may make one other general point. Every time the Chinese side says
                        something, they bring it to me as if I had written it. (Chinese laughter) We
                        have greatly appreciated the delicacy and restraint with which the Chinese
                        delegation has conducted itself in New York within the spirit which we are
                        trying to achieve for the President's visit. On one occasion a lot of paper
                        was brought to my desk and our Ambassador (<persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>) made some comments. On our side we will avoid any
                        polemics. Of course, we recognize each side will represent its convictions.
                        As you undoubtedly know from your observations here and in Ottawa, there are
                        many forces in this country, for a variety of motives, that would not be
                        unhappy if the evolution did not take the form we have planned for it. Our
                        side will do everything it can to show restraint.</p>
                    <p>In this sense, Vietnam is a particularly sensitive point.</p>
                    <p>There are two issues I thought we could discuss in addition, of course, to
                        any problems the Ambassador wishes to raise. First, the India-Pakistan
                        situation. Secondly, if you wish, the problem of the Secretary General. And
                        of course, any topic which you may wish to raise.</p>
                    <p>On the issue of India-Pakistan, you are undoubtedly aware by now through your
                        observations of the American scene that our bureaucracy doesn't always speak
                        with one voice, and that those who don't speak with one voice usually speak
                        to the New York Times. A negative point—you must understand that the New
                        York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine, etc. , don't represent the
                        policy of this Administration on the issue of India-Pakistan.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d68-05" facs="d68-05"/>
                    <p>I don't know whether you have the full details of my conversations with the
                        Prime Minister in Peking. The analysis that I gave to the Prime Minister of
                        our views of that situation remain in full force. We substantially agree
                        with what your delegation said at the United Nations. We substantially agree
                        with the communication which we received through the other channel about
                        your Government's views on the India-Pakistan dispute.</p>
                    <p>Our view, briefly stated, is as follows. One, we will do what we can to
                        alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the economic dislocation caused
                        by them. We have given to this purpose more than the rest of the world put
                        together, and more than four times as much as the newly found friends of
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Second, we will give humanitarian relief for the refugees in East Pakistan,
                        to relieve the suffering and to stop the outflow of refugees. We have
                        earmarked $250 million for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> what had been done with the
                        Ambassador's car, and <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> answered
                        that it had been parked near here and that we would get it when the meeting
                        broke up.)</p>
                    <p>Third, we are in favor of a political solution of the problem, and we have
                        taken many steps in this direction, some of which are outlined in the other
                        channel and some of which I told to the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>We do not accept the proposition that another country has the right to use
                        military force to alleviate whatever strains are caused by the refugees, and
                        we will not accept military aggression by India against Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>As a general proposition, I have told our Ambassador (<persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>) that if the case comes to the
                        Security Council—I wanted to talk with you whether or not it should—it is
                        the President's wish that we not move too far away from you on this issue.
                        It is in neither of our interests to have identical positions.</p>
                    <p>I wanted you also to know two other things that we have done today, actually
                        three other things.</p>
                    <p>First, we sent a note to the Indian Government listing all the things we have
                        done and all the things Pakistan has done. We have pointed out that military
                        aggression will not be understood by the American people or the American
                        Government. This is strictly for your information, and is not generally
                        known—we have talked to friendly governments in the same vein. Specifically,
                        I talked personally today to the Chancellor of the <pb n="6" xml:id="d68-06" facs="d68-06"/>Federal Republic of Germany. On behalf of the President,
                        I also asked the British Ambassador to speak in this sense to the Prime
                        Minister as a personal message from the President. We also told the British
                        Prime Minister—no one in the foreign office—what our strategy will be if it
                        comes to the Security Council, and we have asked for British
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>We have asked Pakistan to hold off going to the United Nations for two days
                        without giving any reason, in order to have a chance to consult with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> that all of this was being
                        done in back channel.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Pakistan should not propose it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They should not propose
                        it only through tomorrow, because I wanted to find out what your plans were.
                        If the Indian attacks continue, we will take certain unilateral steps which
                        I outlined to the Prime Minister in connection with economic aid and the
                        little military assistance that India is getting, which is not much.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to ask two questions. What is your judgment on the wisdom of having
                        this issue go to the Security Council? And secondly, if you feel free to
                        tell me, if it goes to the Security Council, regardless of our intention
                        because some other country may take it there, what are your views?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As for the situation on the
                        India-Pakistan subcontinent, our acting Prime Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CP2">Chi P'eng-fei</persName> made a public speech after Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had left Peking. And
                        within that speech is contained our basic position.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>): We don't have that, do we?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That was the speech that the acting
                        Prime Minister made at the farewell banquet for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's get the text. I
                        have seen excerpts, and I know what you mean. It was not unfriendly towards
                        us so I did not see the full text.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d68-07" facs="d68-07"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: And afterwards, our delegation in the
                        first speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations by Vice Minister,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Ch'iao Kuan-hua</persName>, also made clear
                        our views. And therefore we deal with this problem in accordance with what
                        was discussed in Peking between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and yourself and also our public statements.</p>
                    <p>And if the question comes to the Security Council, that is the question
                        relating to India-Pakistan, we are prepared to speak in accordance with the
                        already mentioned public positions of China on this question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it correct that what
                        the Prime Minister said on my first visit still remains the full position of
                        your Government, everything you said on the first and second visits?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That's true, and also the
                        communication which we have sent through the other channel remains our
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and I have it
                        exactly in mind. I will show you, George (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>). For these purposes, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> works directly for me. No one in the
                        Government except the people in this room knew about this channel. If others
                        know I will let you know, so there will be no confusion when you are talking
                        to someone. No matter what others say, there are only these people and
                        Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> and, of course, the
                        President who know about this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: And Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I said so. Everyone who
                        has been in Peking you can trust.</p>
                    <p>If the case comes to the Security Council there are two problems. First,
                        there are the speeches that are made by various delegations. Secondly, there
                        are any resolutions that will be proposed. On speeches we will assume that
                        you will stay in the general framework of what you have just indicated. We
                        will take the position of listing all of the things that have been done on
                        our side and therefore we do not believe that military aggression—we won't
                        call it military aggression but military “moves”—are justified.</p>
                    <p>The second problem is a resolution. We are now in the process of discussing
                        with some of our embassies, especially New Delhi and Islamabad and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">George Bush</persName>, what a proper resolution
                        would be. And I would like to <pb n="8" xml:id="d68-08" facs="d68-08"/>tell
                        you what we are now thinking of, subject to changes, to bureaucratic replies
                        that we will be getting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> can be very helpful in shaping this discussion by his
                        contribution. Let me tell you the five points we are thinking of and I will
                        be grateful for your reaction:</p>
                    <p>1) Calls upon all states to refrain from any actions that would endanger the
                        peace in the area;</p>
                    <p>2) Urges all parties concerned to refrain from actions which would violate
                        the territorial integrity of India and Pakistan;</p>
                    <p>Miss T'ang: Territorial integrity?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In practice it is
                        obvious what this means.</p>
                    <p>3) Requests the Government of Pakistan to continue urgently its efforts
                        towards creating a favorable climate conducive to the voluntary return of
                        refugees to East Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>4) Requests the Governments of India and Pakistan to take all possible
                        measures to facilitate the safe and speedy return of the refugees to their
                        homes;</p>
                    <p>Five, and this is optional.</p>
                    <p>5) Invites the Governments of Pakistan and India to respond affirmatively to
                        the proposal of the Secretary General offering Good Offices looking towards
                        a peaceful resolution of the situation in the area.</p>
                    <p>The fifth part is not essential. This is a very tentative draft, subject very
                        easily to changes. If you have suggestions we can consider them very easily.
                        Of course, no one except people in this room would know that it was your
                        suggestion. I am not sure we would offer this, but it is the sort of thing
                        we would work towards.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You mean it would not necessarily be
                        put forth by the U.S.?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is the solution
                        towards which we would work, not necessarily a resolution which we would put
                        forward.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d68-09" facs="d68-09"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: At the present time it is impossible
                        for me to make any comments on this. We will study this tentative
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your general
                        attitude towards this issue going to the Security Council? Do you prefer it
                        not to go, or are you indifferent, or do you prefer it to go?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Because we had foreseen there was a
                        great possibility that this question would come up in the Security Council
                        or the General Assembly itself, therefore immediately upon arrival and in
                        its first speech the Chinese delegation spoke on this question. Of course,
                        it is not a situation under our control.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You do not plan to
                        introduce the issue?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We don't have that plan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If it is raised by
                        Pakistan, you would support its being discussed?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It is a matter of fact that we have
                        already further explained our views in committee.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: The third
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The third committee on
                        Friday. We have to decide whether it should go to the Security Council.
                        Would you find it embarrassing if it were taken to the Security Council?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That's nothing on our side.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Indifferent.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: On our side there is no question of
                        being embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will not force the
                        pace and will give you advance information of anything we know will happen.
                        If it goes to the Security Council and then a resolution is discussed… What
                        happens—I have practically no experience in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—I am told that when a resolution is introduced, all
                        delegations talk to each other. How should we handle the contacts between
                        the Chinese delegation and the U.S. delegation?</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d68-10" facs="d68-10"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We would like to consider this later
                        or in light of circumstances that will be prevailing at the time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me know. I'm
                        told—I've no experience in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—that when a
                        debate actually starts things happen very quickly.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: Yes, in fact, Mr.
                        Ambassador, when a resolution is introduced, no matter how small, everyone
                        goes off and consults. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        refers to the fact that traditionally in that one body, as opposed to other
                        committees, there is a great interchange between delegations on every
                        resolution. Even on one word they are still talking to one another off in
                        one corner. That is why he raised the question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am no more eager to
                        have our people in a corner with you than you are to have yours with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: We will do what Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wants.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I believe our attitude is already made
                        clear through the exchange of opinion in the other channel. That is, on
                        matters of principle related to policy we have agreed to contact your
                        Excellency to discuss these problems.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And you want…….excuse
                        me.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As for the problem of daily contact in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we haven't considered this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Ambassador, we are
                        not so eager for daily contact. In fact, we have told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> this. Anything that permits
                        consideration in Washington must be cleared in Washington. We do not want to
                        overwhelm you with every bright idea of our bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>If the case comes to the Security Council, and you have a resolution and the
                        British have a resolution, for example, and someone wants to change a word,
                        how do we get in touch with you on that? Anything of principle must go to
                        us. On the other day-to-day contacts there is no hurry. In fact, we would
                        not want too much for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We are not familiar with the
                        procedures of the United Nations. We are not so familiar with them as Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d68-11" facs="d68-11"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: May I interrupt. It
                        may be of interest to the Ambassador that in the Security Council normally
                        you can get time for a reasonable short recess, unlike the General Assembly.
                        This would be particularly true in the case of Mr.
                            <persName>Huang</persName>. They will accept a 30-minute or 10-minute
                        adjournment, as opposed to other bodies. There they would respect his
                        request for time during consideration of these resolutions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let us leave this for
                        the time being because you will want to reflect upon it.</p>
                    <p>Let me sum up what I understand our procedures are. We will settle issues of
                        principle between us. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> has our full confidence and will carry out in the
                        spirit of what we have agreed. We are conscious of the fact, and it is in
                        our interest, that we do not give specific indications of cooperation in the
                        view of other delegations by discussing resolutions. However, if things move
                        fast, we shall move first to gain time through procedural devices.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> will talk to me or
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>, and we can get word
                        to you through less visible channels. If this does not work, we will
                        consider what to do. Does that seem like reasonable procedures to you?</p>
                    <p>And we will do this only on issues of the first importance, such as South
                        Asia, and we will not bother with every issue before the United Nations
                        until after the President's visit, when many things may become clearer. Is
                        this an agreeable procedure, Mr. Ambassador?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I believe we can agree to the
                        procedures you just mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will do it on this
                        basis, and err on the side of doing right and good atmosphere, rather than
                        bureaucratic elegance. Even if some of the resolutions lack exactly the
                        right word. (Chinese laughter)</p>
                    <p>I don't know whether the Ambassador remembers when we had our roast duck with
                        the Prime Minister and he told us what he did with his office. My secret
                        dream is that somebody would let me .do that with our bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>There are two other things. One is on the issue … . .</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: May I interrupt on this issue? What is
                        your assessment of the present situation that exists in India/Pakistan?</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d68-12" facs="d68-12"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (Asked Lord for
                        intelligence reports which <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> got,
                        and for a map which he also got. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then begins reading which Indian units are in
                        which places, and General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>
                        then takes this up.)</p>
                    <p>This violates every security rule. The major attack is through Jessore
                        (indicating on map). As I remember, two Indian brigades are attacking in
                        this area. The Indians claim they are guerrillas, and the Pakistanis claim
                        they are Indian troops. Whatever they are, it is either the Indian Army or
                        the best-equipped guerrilla force that has appeared in recent years. Then
                        they are attacking here in Chittagong Hill Station, in the direction of
                        Chittagong.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: The report is that
                        there are as many as two divisions supported by armor.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In all?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: In all.</p>

                        of attack) Our assessment is that in all, the units total two divisions and

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: And in brigade size

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He is giving the units.

                        above.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Lord) We should get
                        the briefing text attached to these minutes from now on.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: It is attached, but

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Don't undermine the

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: The 23rd and 12th

                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: In Chittagong.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In Chittagong,
                        right.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: The 27th Brigade of
                        the 14th Division.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We were told—I'm not
                        sure it's right—that they have taken their two mountain divisions from your
                        frontier and moved them down. Frankly, I don't know what mountain divisions
                        would be doing in East Pakistan, except I trained during the war for jungle
                        warfare and I spent a very cold winter in the Battle of the Bulge.</p>
                    <p>Miss T'ang: The Battle… ?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Battle of the
                        Bulge. That was before you were born.</p>
                    <p>Miss T'ang: I don't think so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This will give you an
                        idea. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> nods) There are totally
                        conflicting reports on losses. The Indians say the Pakistanis have lost 6
                        airplanes, and the Pakistanis admitted losing 3 planes.</p>
                    <p>If we have specific information like that, we could send it in a sealed
                        envelope to the hotel if you want us to. Not on a regular basis, but when
                        something special happens, we will send it from my office.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: If necessary, we will communicate.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There are two other
                        things.</p>
                    <p>On the Secretary General—you need not give your opinion now—if you have a
                        view, it will be taken seriously into account.</p>
                    <p>I talked to the Prime Minister when I was there about the Formosan
                        Independence Movement. We understand there have been some demonstrations.
                        There are two things here. First, there is no U.S. Government involvement in
                        these activities, and, as I told the Prime Minister, there will not be.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, as far as these groups are concerned, if they do anything illegal
                        we will take strong measures, but we have no legal basis to prevent <pb n="14" xml:id="d68-14" facs="d68-14"/>them from assembling. If we did,
                        there were a number of occasions in recent years when we would have been
                        delighted to do that in Washington. The President can get larger
                        demonstrations against himself on any university campus than any you have so
                        far attracted.</p>
                    <p>Did you have any topics you wished to discuss with me?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As for the question of the Secretary
                        General, we aren't familiar with all the candidates put forward.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are too familiar
                        with them. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> chuckles.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: And we have undertaken no obligations
                        to any.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Some claim they have
                        your support.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That was not said with our
                        approval.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. That's good
                        to know.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Does the U.S. side have any ideas
                        along these lines?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As I understand it, we
                        have a slight leaning toward Jakobson, but we are very open to other views.
                        Is that right, George? (to <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There are a number of
                        others who would also be acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: There have been words going about at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, asking his Excellency <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> to remain the Secretary General for
                        a very short period, for a transitional period so that that question of a
                        new Secretary General could be discussed at a further date. Is there any
                        grounds to that?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have not heard this,
                        at least not in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: There were rumors to
                        this effect. The Soviet Union mentioned this in the last two to three days.
                        Our judgment has been that under no conditions would <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> stay, even for one month. That is
                            <pb n="15" xml:id="d68-15" facs="d68-15"/>our best judgment. We had
                        recent contact with the French Ambassador. The Soviets made a statement that
                            <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> was staying on for a short
                        period of time. Our judgment, especially in the light of his most recent
                        illness, is that he would not want to stay on under any conditions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have not expressed
                        our view on that.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: We only indicated to
                        the French our views on an interim arrangement.— we prefer to solve the
                        problem and get it out of the way, but that was some time ago.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We heard Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> paid a visit to Canada, and he
                        officially put forward to the Prime Minister of Canada, <persName corresp="#p_TPE2">Trudeau</persName>, the idea of asking his Excellency
                            <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> to remain in office for a
                        short period, for a transitional period.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought he said for
                        more than a transitional period.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: Originally he did.
                        And then when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was here, he
                        asked if he would be willing to stay on for one year.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We do not consider that
                        an interim period.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: No. I am not
                        familiar with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> raised something with <persName corresp="#p_TPE2">Trudeau</persName>. However, it didn't get anywhere,
                        or I would remember the details. I will check, but we are proceeding under
                        the assumption that <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> will leave
                        on January 1 and therefore the conversation had no consequence. They never
                        approached us.</p>
                    <p>Of the candidates mentioned, the only one we have said is unacceptable to us
                        was Herrera.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: But as your side already openly
                        expressed your attitude toward Mr. Herrera, it is quite difficult for us to
                        express our attitude.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not asking you to;
                        I am just informing you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: What I mean, under the circumstances
                        where the U.S. has already openly expressed its attitude toward Mr. Herrera
                        as a candidate, then it is very difficult for us to discuss the
                        qualifications of his candidacy, and it also puts us in a very difficult
                        position.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d68-16" facs="d68-16"/>
                    <p>Anyway on the question of Secretary General, we have undertaken no
                        obligations on any part. Neither do we have any obligations toward his
                        Excellency <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>. Of course, neither
                        has he put forward this question. The Soviet side has had no contact with us
                        on this at all.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the future, before
                        we express an opinion on the Secretary General, we will try to let you know
                        our opinion privately.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As for the question of the so-called
                        Taiwan Independence Movement, I would only like to call your attention to
                        the fact that elements are taking part in the so-called Taiwan Independence
                        Movement and becoming more and more active recently in the U.S. and other
                        places, also, for example, in Japan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                        talked to me about this, and what I said to him from our side remains our
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You asked me if we have questions to
                        raise on our side. Do you have any ideas on the situation in the Middle
                        East? To be more specific, what ideas does the U.S. have on the procedures
                        for this question in the United Nations?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Middle East
                        negotiations have been handled in different forums simultaneously. At one
                        stage we talked bilaterally with the Soviet Union. Then we went through a
                        period when we attempted to act as intermediary between Egypt and Israel to
                        bring about an interim settlement. In the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        we have handled it in a four-power context with the United States, Soviet
                        Union, Britain and France. We are not in principle opposed to the
                        participation of the other permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>The Big Four have not been very active lately. When did they last meet (to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>)?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: Six weeks or two
                        months ago.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The issue then was
                        guarantees?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>: Yes, and it was not
                        discussed very seriously. The questions were whether to have a communique
                        about implementing Security Council Resolution 242. That was what really the
                        last three or four meetings boiled down to.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d68-17" facs="d68-17"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At the moment all the
                        negotiations seem to be not very active. There have been no effective
                        two-power discussions between us and the Soviet Union for about a year. The
                        interim settlement is at the moment stalemated, because the Egyptians are
                        asking for a commitment to a final settlement before signing an interim
                        settlement, and Israel wants an interim settlement to avoid a final
                        settlement. If the Ambassador (<persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>)
                        will forgive me, the four make up for lack of precision by enormous ability
                        in procrastination. But they have—speaking quite openly—the four have not
                        really in the last year discussed any concrete issues that could move toward
                        a settlement. They talk about more abstract problems of guarantees or
                        communiques and so forth.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Mr. Riad, the Foreign Minister of
                        Egypt, will be coming to the United Nations either at the end of this month
                        or the beginning of next month. And it seems that the Egyptian side would
                        like a debate held in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with regard to
                        this question. But we still don't know what Egypt will decide, what the
                        final result will be. Does the U.S. side have any consideration, what
                        results it wishes for in the debate in the United Nations?</p>
                    <p>May I add also on our side that we have already stated, and say now, that we
                        are not prepared to take part in consultations among the four powers. I say
                        this because you mentioned that you were not opposed to participation in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> discussions by other permanent members
                        of the Security Council. So that's our attitude.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our general view on the
                        situation in the Middle East has been that a great deal of effort has been
                        expended over the last few years over debate on theoretical formulas. When
                        you read the sacramental language of Security Council Resolution 242 you see
                        phrases like “just and lasting peace” and “secure and recognized
                        boundaries.” It is only <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> lawyers who
                        understand this. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs)</p>
                    <p>We would like to move the situation toward some concrete progress. In a way
                        debate on theoretical formulas has the tendency to confirm the existing
                        status quo.</p>
                    <p>Indeed I told Mr. Riad at a private dinner I had with him when he was here
                        that the major immediate task was to get some movement in the situation
                        rather than discuss theory about how such movements should be brought about.
                            <pb n="18" xml:id="d68-18" facs="d68-18"/>So, our effort in this debate
                        will be to prevent too much exacerbation of feelings by both sides and too
                        much rigid commitments by Israel to existing lines.</p>
                    <p>Miss T'ang: Could you repeat that last sentence?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the one hand, to
                        keep the rhetoric within tolerable limits. On the other hand, to keep Israel
                        from committing itself more and more irrevocably to existing lines.</p>
                    <p>Miss T'ang: You mean the rigidity of its position—you do not want Israel to
                        take an increasingly rigid position?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly. We would like
                        Israel to make some movement. We think making too absolute demands on it has
                        the practical tendency of making it easier for it to stay where it is.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have no more questions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We still have to get
                        back to Washington tonight. I don't want to stay in this apartment—it's
                        probably haunted. (Chinese laughter)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We heard you are going to California
                        for Thanksgiving.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, with the
                        President. You can always reach me at any of the numbers that I gave you.
                        What is the best way to call you—through the switchboard, or are there any
                        direct numbers?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We have no way of dialing direct.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No direct phones? Have
                        you tried to get them?</p>
                    <p>Miss T'ang: We have not thought of that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't wish to tell
                        the Ambassador how to do his business, but you can get direct phones so that
                        you can dial yourself, with your own numbers.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: This is because we moved into the
                        hotel with very tentative plans to stay there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Having lived in the
                        Roosevelt Hotel, the only way to endure it is to hope to leave quickly.
                        (Chinese laughter) I have never been in a <pb n="19" xml:id="d68-19" facs="d68-19"/>winning political campaign. One of the three lost ones
                        that I was in was Governor Rockefeller's, who had headquarters in the
                        Roosevelt Hotel. So I know it very well. (Chinese laughter) There is serious
                        thought being given to asking me to retire for a few months during the next
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Thank you very much for coming
                        especially to New York to give us your opinions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a great pleasure
                        to see you again. I remember my visits to China with great warmth. There was
                        enormous courtesy shown to us on both visits. Please convey our high
                        personal regards to the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Will you be in Peking when we come again?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I don't know.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you call us, what
                        name will you use?</p>
                    <p>(There was then a brief discussion of what name should be used by Miss
                        T'ang.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Perhaps we could simply use the name
                        “Nancy.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The name Nancy presents
                        some complications. It's probably in your files—you know more about me than
                        we know about you—but a girl named “Nancy” calls me occasionally.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs)</p>
                    <p>(There was some further discussion of a code name.)</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: How about “Kay.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You could say “Miss
                        Kay” is calling. It is the same name as the nightclub singer who wanted to
                        go to China. Her name was Miss Kay. She didn't believe that there were no
                        nightclubs in China. She couldn't believe there is a world without
                        nightclubs.</p>
                    <p>(There was then agreement on the use of the name “Kay.”)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You should call as
                        “Miss Kay” and ask for any of us, even in California.</p>
                    <p>(<persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> then explained the various
                        telephone numbers and handed over the list.)</p>
                    <p>(There were final goodbyes and pleasantries all around.)</p>

                    <p>11/29/71</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. side would propose the following with regard to the advance trip
                        to make detailed arrangements for the President's visit:</p>
                    <p>— Dates. It would be most convenient for the U.S. if the trip could be
                        conducted during the period from January 3 through January 10, 1972.
                        Alternate dates would be January 10 through 17 but they are much less
                        convenient.</p>
                    <p>— Locations. The group would like to visit Shanghai, Hangchow and Peking to
                        survey each site that the President would visit, including residences,
                        meeting rooms, and locations for various events. It is estimated that the
                        team would need about 1 1/2 days each in Shanghai and Hangchow and four or
                        five days in Peking. The best procedure might be to visit Peking first for
                        two days, then go to Shanghai and Hangchow, returning to Peking to complete
                        any unfinished business.</p>
                    <p>— Size of Party. The U.S. would like to send a group of about twenty persons
                        in addition to the aircraft crew of some seventeen persons. The names of
                        these individuals in protocol order will be forwarded to the People's
                        Republic of China well in advance of the agreed date for the trip. It is
                        presently anticipated that the team will be headed by Brigadier General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Alexander M. Haig</persName>, Jr., U.S.
                        Army, who is the Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security
                        Affairs and who has Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        complete confidence.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d69-02" facs="d69-02"/>
                    <p>2. As a related technical matter, there is a preliminary action concerning
                        the ground satellite terminal which it would be useful to take prior to
                        arrival of the advance party in January. The INTELSAT Communications
                        Satellite Committee which controls the satellites that will relay signals
                        from the ground satellite terminal is meeting during the week of December 8
                        and is not scheduled to meet again until February 23. To preclude having to
                        reconvene the group during the intervening period, it is proposed that the
                        Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), which manages INTELSAT,
                        request authority from the Committee at the December 8 meeting to approve an
                        application for use of satellite facilities if received at a subsequent date
                        from the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>This action would not commit the People's Republic of China-to use these
                        facilities, but would merely be a preliminary step to ensure that
                        arrangements can be made efficiently once the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has determined that they are satisfactory. A formal
                        application by the People's Republic of China could be made after the
                        January visit when a detailed presentation of the facilities the U.S.
                        recommends and various leasing options will be made.</p>
                    <p>3. With regard to the November 20 Chinese note on the India-Pakistan
                        situation, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wanted
                        Prime Minister <pb n="3" xml:id="d69-03" facs="d69-03"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> to be informed of the
                        various steps that the U.S. Government has taken in recent days, on this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>On November 23, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, in his
                        meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName>,
                        exchanged views on this matter in the context of United Nations business.
                        This discussion included the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council resolution which might have a restraining
                        impact. After consultation with the Pakistani government this resolution has
                        been strengthened. Enclosed is a copy of the kind of strengthened resolution
                        we are prepared to support.</p>
                    <p>On November 23, the U.S. Ambassador in New Delhi was instructed to make a
                        strong demarche to the Indian Government, informing it that the U.S.
                        Government and people would not understand an Indian decision to resort to
                        war. On November 29, an even stronger representation was made to Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> on the situation,
                        including our inquiry concerning India's failure to respond to the U.S.
                        proposal already agreed to by President Yahya that both sides pull back
                        their forces from the borders.</p>
                    <p>On November 23, the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow was instructed to urge the
                        Soviet Government to exercise restraint on India. On November 27, a letter
                        from the President to Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        reinforced this request and warned of the consequences of continued
                        hostilities.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d69-04" facs="d69-04"/>
                    <p>On November 23, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> talked
                        to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> on behalf of the
                        President. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> informed the
                        Chancellor of U.S. thinking on a possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Security Council resolution and said that the U.S. would appreciate a
                        demarche to the Indian Government from the Government of the Federal
                        Republic of Germany, urging an end to military action.</p>
                    <p>On November 24, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> informed
                        the British Ambassador of U.S. thinking on a possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council resolution. It was emphasized that the U.S.
                        would leave to the Government of Pakistan the decision as to whether the
                        issue should be referred to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security
                        Council. The U.S. side asked the British to support Pakistan in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or, if this proved impossible, to refrain
                        from supporting India.</p>
                    <p>On November 25, the President called Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HERG1">Heath</persName> to express his concern over the
                        India-Pakistan situation and the Indian actions which have contributed to
                        its deterioration. He told the Prime Minister that while urging restraint in
                        the subcontinent the U.S. will favor Pakistan in its comments. He repeated
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s representation of the
                        previous day.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d69-05" facs="d69-05"/>
                    <p>The U.S. is now using administrative techniques to delay implementing
                        economic assistance measures for India.</p>
                    <p>On November 30, the U.S. Director of the World Bank will warn the other
                        directors of the adverse impact on Indian development caused by the outbreak
                        of war.</p>
                    <p>At the next Indian incursion, the U.S. will suspend the shipment of arms to
                        India (now at a very low level—about $5 million per year).</p>
                    <p>Other steps are under consideration, including actions the U.S. might take if
                        full hostilities erupt.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. is keeping the Government of Pakistan fully informed of all steps it
                        is taking with regard to this situation.</p>
                    <p>4. In line with the U.S. practice of informing the Prime Minister, of
                        negotiations of possible interest, the U.S. Government would like to inform
                        the Government of the People's Republic of China of the current state of our
                        negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the subject
                        of incidents at sea. As a result of discussions in Moscow from October 12 to
                        22, 1971, both sides' delegations agreed to refer the following provisions
                        to their respective governments as the basis for an agreement:</p>
                    <p>— Both sides will instruct commanding officers to observe strictly the letter
                        and spirit of the international rules of the road.</p>

                    <p>— Commanding officers will keep their ships far enough apart to avoid risk of
                        collision.</p>
                    <p>— Ships engaged in surveillance operations will keep enough distance to avoid
                        risk of collision and to avoid endangering the ships under surveillance.</p>
                    <p>— Ships of both sides operating within sight of each other will show correct
                        international signals (flag, sound and light).</p>
                    <p>— Ships of both sides will not simulate attacks by aiming their guns or other
                        armament at a passing ship, or by launching an object in the direction of a
                        passing ship.</p>
                    <p>— Ships will not use their searchlights at night to 'blind' the bridge
                        personnel on passing ships.</p>
                    <p>— Ships will show correct international signals when conducting exercises
                        with submerged submarines.</p>
                    <p>— Ships will stay well clear of ships of the other side engaged in such
                        operations as aircraft carrier launch and recovery.</p>
                    <p>— Pilots will be instructed to use the greatest prudence and caution when
                        approaching ships of the other side.</p>
                    <p>— Pilots will be instructed to display correct navigation lights.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d69-07" facs="d69-07"/>
                    <p>— Ships planning to conduct flight operations will be required to give
                        appropriate signals.</p>
                    <p>— Pilots will be instructed not to make simulated attacks by the simulated
                        use of weapons against ships, and not to perform acrobatic maneuvers over
                        ships, including supersonic overflights.</p>
                    <p>— Arrangements for the mutual exchange of information regarding collisions
                        and other incidents at sea should be established.</p>
                    <p>— The question of overflights should be thoroughly examined during the next
                        round of talks (expected to be in Washington early in 1972).</p>

                    <p>30 November 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <list type="subject">
                        <head>Subj:</head>
                        <item>24th Meeting with Chinese in Paris on November 29, 1971</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>As instructed in the message brought by the courier on the morning of Nov 29,
                        I requested an appointment on the phone talking to Tsao at 10:30 a.m. He
                        said that he could not answer right away as the Ambassador was not
                        available, but he would call me back later.</p>
                    <p>He did so while I was talking to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> on the phone. He suggested meeting the following day
                        and I indicated that one matter I had to discuss with them involved a
                        certain urgency. (The release of the supplementary details on the Presidents
                        trip, but I did not mention them over the phone.) He then consulted the
                        Ambassador and proposed 5:00 p.m. on Monday, 29 November 1971. I at once
                        accepted and went on foot to the Chinese Embassy in Neuilly after leaving my
                        car at a safe distance.</p>
                    <p>I was received at the garden gate by Wei, wearing a <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> jacket and with a red metal badge on his
                        left breast with <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s profile on it.
                        At the door Tsao was waiting. He was in Western clothes (coat and tie) but
                        he also wore a <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> badge over his
                        handkerchief pocket. I was escorted to the Red Room and as usual the
                        Ambassador appeared within minutes. Exchange of “Ni Haos”, etc.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d70-02" facs="d70-02"/>
                    <p>I then apologized for asking to see him the same day and explained your oral
                        message concerning our desire to release the additional details regarding
                        the President's trip seven hours earlier and in Washington rather than on
                        the West Coast as we had previously indicated because the press of
                        congressional business required the President to remain in Washington rather
                        than on the West Coast.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName> said that he saw
                        no problem in this at all. The Chinese had agreed to our release of these
                        supplementary details on Nov 30 and the hour at which we did it was really
                        up to us. They did not intend to make a simultaneous announcement but if
                        anyone asked them whether our release was true or not, they would confirm
                        it. I then said that the written message I had was quite long. Did he want
                        me to read it all in French and have Wei translate it or would giving it to
                        Tsao and having him translate it later for the Ambassador be better. He said
                        that I would sum up the contents in French and Wei would translate it and
                        then he would see Tsao's detailed translation from the English original.</p>
                    <p>I read him the paragraph about the further preliminary group headed by
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> going to China and
                        this did not seem to be a problem to him. He said that he would forward this
                        to Peking. He asked whether I would be in this group and I said that I did
                        not believe that this would be the case. He said that he was aware of the
                        meeting between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> in New York “to
                        discuss United Nations Affairs”. Some emphasis on the last phrase.</p>
                    <p>I then read the essentials of the steps we had taken. I did, however, read
                        the communications satellite paragraph to him in French verbatim. He said
                        that this was a technical matter. He would have a paper for me at 11:30 a.m.
                        on Nov 30 that might answer some of these matters and he asked if I could be
                        there. I replied that I would, of course, be there.</p>
                    <p>I then read the various steps the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had taken on the Indo-Pakistan
                        crisis. He nodded at each one saying, “I know”. I would gather that the
                        Pakistanis had kept him informed. (At least I hope that is his source rather
                        than a capability to read our mail.) He said that these were positive steps
                        and asked what I thought of the Indians. I replied jokingly that, “the
                        non-violent are often dangerous.” He laughed and said, “I share your opinion
                        of the Indians.” He did, however, seem very pleased with the recital of our
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>I then read him the paragraph concerning our talks with the Soviets regarding
                        the prevention of incidents at sea. He did not appear very interested.
                        Perhaps he was, but, if so, he did not show it.</p>
                    <p>He made a number of complimentary personal remarks and could not have been
                        more pleasant.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d70-03" facs="d70-03"/>
                    <p>I then said that I would be going to the United States at the end of the week
                        and would be gone a week or ten days. He asked, “Are you going to the Azores
                        meeting?” I said that I did not know. There was perhaps a fifty percent
                        chance. He grinned and replied that he would place the probability higher
                        than that.</p>
                    <p>He then said that he would be looking forward to seeing me the following
                        morning at 11:30. He walked me to the door of the building. The Ambassador
                        was, as always, in a Mao jacket, but on several previous occasions he had
                        worn no Mao badge. On this occasion, like his two subordinates, he was
                        wearing one.</p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing was washed down with gallons of jasmine tea and, thank
                        God, only preserved apples and unsalted peanuts from Shansi.</p>
                    <p>As I left the building a great Mao portrait still smiled inscrutably down
                        from the lobby of the Embassy. Wei saw me to the gate and I left.</p>

                        conversations with representatives of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> conducted over the period December 3-4, 1971 in New York
                        City.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. First Meeting - 10:30 p.m., December 3, 1971,
                        Roosevelt Hotel</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> arrived about 15
                        minutes after the originally appointed hour due to cancellation of the
                        flight on which he had reservations. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> was unable to reach the Chinese side to inform them of
                        the delay.) He was met by Miss Wang and Miss T'ang who asked if he had run
                        into trouble and indicated they were beginning to think he might not be
                        coming. They escorted him to the same room he had been in on his previous
                        visit, down the corridor to the left from the elevator and almost at the end
                        of the hall.</p>
                    <p>Miss Wang explained that the Ambassador was at a reception and probably would
                        not be back until late and therefore they would be glad to receive the
                        message and convey it to him on his return. After they had read the message
                        (Tab A) a discussion ensued as to how contact might best be made the
                        following morning. It was agreed that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> would call the hotel room which the two women shared
                        (ext. 1422) at 10:00 a.m. and that Miss T'ang would answer and indicate
                        whether it was desired that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> come to the Roosevelt Hotel. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> politely indicated that he would be
                        available at an earlier hour but the Chinese were adamant that 10:00 a.m.
                        was the best time for telephoning.</p>

                    <p>After a relaxed conversation over tea on inconsequential subjects, Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> took leave of his hosts.
                        Both women escorted him to the elevator and got in saying they would go down
                        with him. During the ride, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> indicated that it might be best if the group were not
                        seen together in the lobby, and the women agreed and left the elevator at
                        the second floor.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Telephone Calls between 10:00 a.m. and 10:45
                        a.m., December 4, 1971</p>
                    <p>Before 10:00 a.m. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> had
                        received a call from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        indicating that he should convey to the Chinese Ambassador that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was under great
                        pressure to go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and had been trying
                        to hold off the bureaucracy. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> was to phone by 10:30 a.m. with the Chinese reaction on
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> question. A <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting was scheduled to commence at 11:00 a.m.
                        Subsequently, General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> called
                        to say that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> should
                        convey that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side had heard from the
                        Pakistanis and the Pakistanis left to the judgment of the United States
                        whether to go to the Security Council. In view of this the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> felt it should proceed unless there were
                        strong feelings to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>No one answered at 10:00 a.m. when Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> called Miss T'ang; however, when the call was replaced
                        a few minutes later she was there. Miss T'ang reported it was the view of
                        the Ambassador that the meeting on the 10th was “unnecessary at the present
                        time.” She indicated that there was nothing else to report so Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> said he had additional
                        information to convey to them concerning the first topic in the note. Miss
                        T'ang responded that she would have to check on this and asked if he would
                        call back in 10 minutes.</p>
                    <p>In the intervening period Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that the Chinese side was saying, in so
                        many words, that it had no reply. He instructed Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> to tell them, either in a meeting or
                        over the phone, if necessary, that the U.S. had heard from the Pakistanis
                        and they were leaving it up to American judgment as to whether to call a
                        Security Council meeting. Therefore, the U.S. felt it should proceed.</p>
                    <p>After several attempts to reach Miss T'ang, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> again made contact and she indicated
                        that if he had anything written to pass on they would accept it; however,
                        “if it was verbal, or if he only had an <pb n="3" xml:id="d71-03" facs="d71-03"/>oral message, perhaps this could be done some other
                        time.” Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> said he would
                        call back shortly. She asked if the information was urgent and he reiterated
                        that it concerned further developments related to the first subject of the
                        note and was something they would want to know. He said he did not want to
                        inconvenience them in any way, and offered to pass the information over the
                        phone if that would be easier.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> then reported to
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> and began putting the
                        oral message on paper. General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> called back shortly, agreeing to the text (Tab B) with
                        the addition of the phrase “in coordination with other powers” which lowered
                        the U.S. profile somewhat.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> then called Miss T'ang
                        to say that he had a written message to deliver. She seemed surprised and
                        asked if he would call back in ten minutes. In assenting, he indicated that
                        there would be no need for a special meeting or direct reply.</p>
                    <p>At 10:45 a.m. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> called
                        Miss T'ang again and she said, “if you deem it necessary you can come with a
                        message in written form.” Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> reiterated that he wished to deliver a written message
                        and could be there in ten minutes if that was convenient. She asked for a
                        call in five minutes. At 10:50 a.m., Miss T'ang said that they would be glad
                        to receive the written message in the usual way.</p>
                    <p>When Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> called to
                        indicate that he finally had an appointment, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> instructed him to tell them that the U.S. side was
                        going to call a Security Council meeting.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Meeting at 11:00 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> arrived at the
                        Roosevelt Hotel at 11:00 a.m. and was greeted by Miss Wang and Miss T'ang
                        who escorted him to the usual meeting room. After they had read the
                        hand-printed note (Tab B) and discussed it briefly, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> added orally that the U.S. intended
                        to move toward a Security Council meeting. The ladies promised they would
                        convey the message to the Ambassador and stated they had nothing to say at
                        the present time. They added that if there were anything to convey they
                        would contact the U.S. side through the previously agreed arrangement.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d71-04" facs="d71-04"/>
                    <p>A very genial discussion then ensued, including comments on various Eastern
                        cities and the spreading megalopolis along the Eastern seaboard and the
                        President's forthcoming trip to China. Miss Wang asked who would accompany
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> cautioned that anything he said on
                        that subject would have to be totally off the record and unofficial, but
                        that he did not believe anything final had been decided. He speculated,
                        however, that there would probably not be any women accompanying Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> other than the President's
                        secretary, Miss Woods, who had been listed in the book given to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in October. (This in fact is the current
                        plan.) He added that there might be a few additional security personnel.
                        They agreed that the discussion would be a non conversation and asked
                        whether any of the White House security personnel were women. With a passing
                        reference to the Woman's Liberation Movement in the U.S., Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> indicated that in the past
                        couple of years a few women have been brought into the White House security
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>They also inquired about people on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s staff, including the secretaries, who would be
                        on the President's trip. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> indicated that plans were not final but that it was a
                        much sought after assignment. In response to his inquiry, they said they
                        thought they would be in Peking when the President arrived. They noted that
                        the woman who had served as the interpreter for the technical discussions
                        was also at the UN and would return to Peking for the visit. Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> remarked that he thought he
                        had seen her on the CBS television coverage of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> delegation's flight from Paris to New York.</p>
                    <p>One noteworthy point developed during the discussion of New York City. They
                        indicated they had done some exploring and visited a number of department
                        stores and book stores, and also mentioned the restriction on their movement
                        beyond the city which required prior notification, comment ing that they
                        assumed this was true in other countries as well. (Note: Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> treated this subject delicately but
                        at some point in the future there might be a propitious moment for Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to inform them that if
                        they desire to travel it would be handled routinely and quietly.)</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d71-05" facs="d71-05"/>
                    <p>Toward the end of the discussion, they raised the question of the timing of
                        the U.S. side going to the Security Council. They indicated they assumed it
                        might be after the weekend. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> responded that he was unaware of the precise timing,
                        but it was his impression that it would be very soon. He noted casually that
                        there had been strong sentiment in the U.S. Government to move to the UN
                        immediately but that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        had been holding things down. Now, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> felt the U.S. should proceed. They then confirmed
                        that Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> had received the
                        additional information concerning the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        subsequent to the previous evening's meeting, and that the point made orally
                        about the U.S. intention to seek a meeting had been received after the note
                        had been written.</p>
                    <p>As Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> was departing they
                        asked him to extend their personal regards to their friends Miss Matthews
                        and Miss Pineau and he reciprocated. They then dumped the candy bowl into
                        napkins, and presented the candy to Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s two secretaries. They had earlier noted that
                        they sometimes received Chinese candies from their friends in Canada. After
                        a mild protest, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>
                        expressed appreciation for this gesture. They then escorted him to the
                        elevator and this time did not get in.</p>
                    <p>Both Miss Wang and Miss T'ang were relaxed and gracious and the conversation
                        was lively and extremely friendly. From this series of encounters it appears
                        that the Ambassador has very little leverage. Although he obviously had not
                        received any guidance from Peking on the note presented the previous
                        evening, the rejection of the December 10 invitation combined with emphasis
                        on written communication may indicate that Peking is having second thoughts
                        about using this arrangement for tete-a-tetes on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issues.</p>
                    <p>[Tab A]</p>

                    <p>1. The U.S. side wanted the Chinese side to be aware of the following
                        developments. In light of the deteriorating situation in South. Asia, the
                        United States has told Pakistan that it is prepared to take this issue to
                        the U.N. Security Council. Assuming the Pakistani Government favors this
                        step, the U.S. would plan to work toward a Security Council resolution along
                        the lines of the current tentative draft attached. Based on consultations
                        with the Pakistani Government, this draft is strengthened over the U.S.
                        draft discussed on November 23.</p>
                    <p>In view of the urgency of this situation, the U.S. wishes to inform the
                        Chinese through this channel. of the measures it is currently taking. The
                        State Department announced today, December 3, the U.S. decision of December
                        2 to cancel all remaining valid licenses for military equipment for India.
                        This is in addition to the December 1 announcement that all such future
                        licenses for India were suspended, existing licenses would not be renewed,
                        and some current licenses relating to ammunition were canceled. The U.S. is
                        now reviewing all economic assistance programs to South Asia to determine
                        what further measures might be appropriate. It is in the meantime holding up
                        new disbursements.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side proposes that as the situation in the United Nations evolves,
                        the U.S. and Chinese sides maintain contact through Pakistani diplomats. If
                        the Chinese side wishes to contact the U.S. side directly, the U.S. side
                        suggests that it first call Washington, using the procedure agreed upon on
                        November 23. If any American official, no matter what level, seeks to
                        arrange a meeting with the Chinese side, this should not be considered

                    <p>2. In light of the pressure building up on the issue of a successor to
                        Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>, the
                        question arises as to how the People's Republic of China wishes to proceed.
                        For example, there have been informal discussions in New York looking toward
                        a possible informal meeting of the five permanent members of the Secretary
                        Council. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> plans to be in
                        New York on other business Friday, December 10, 1971 and could arrange to
                        see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> secretly if
                        the Chinese side would like to discuss this matter as well as any other
                        pertinent U.N. topics, including the South Asian situation. If the Chinese
                        side considers an earlier meeting desirable, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is prepared to rearrange his schedule.</p>

                    <p>FROM: NANCY OULLEITE (PARIS)</p>
                    <p>BEGIN TEXT</p>
                    <p>I saw Chinese at eleven oclock on 10 December and was handed following
                        handwritten message:</p>
                    <p>“We are very grateful if the inventory of the detailed specifications will be
                        provided as early as possible so that we can transmit to Peking within one
                        week.”</p>
                    <p>I was read and given the following typewritten message: “Taking account of
                        the fact that the convicts John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau,
                        two U.S. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> spies, after being tried, have
                        admitted their crimes. The department concerned of the Chinese Government
                        has now decided to treat them with leniency: Downey's original sentence of
                        life imprisonment, will be replaced by one of five years imprisonment,
                        beginning from December 13, 1971; Fecteau, who was sentenced to twenty years
                        imprisonment, will be released before the expiration of his term, and he
                        will be set free and cross the border at SUMCHUN on December 13, 1971.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side hereby informs the U.S. side that Maryann Harbert (female)
                        and Gerald Ross McLaughlin (male), two Americans, illegally trespassed in a
                        yacht into China's territorial waters near the TAMKON ISLANDS <pb n="2" xml:id="d72-02" facs="d72-02"/>(ofstuary) of the Pearl River, Kwangtung
                        province and were detained by Chinese Civil Police on April 21, 1968. The
                        above fact of trespassing into Chinese territorial waters has been
                        established through investigations by the Chinese authorities concerned.
                        Harbert has admitted her mistake and will also be released and sent across
                        the border on December 13, 1971. McLlaughlin resisted investigation during
                        his detention and committed suicide on March 7, 1969. He died after
                        emergency measures to save him failed and his body was cremated. The Red
                        Cross Society of China will inform his family of this through the American
                        National Red Cross.”</p>

                    <p>Consistent with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        understanding with Prime Minister Chou <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">En-lai</persName> the U.S. side would like to inform the Chinese side
                        of the following measures it took with regard to South Asia since the
                        December 12 meeting between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                            Hua</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> in New York City.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday December 12, the U.S. used the hot line to Moscow calling for an
                        urgent end to hostilities to prevent consequences wanted by no one.</p>
                    <p>Early Monday morning, December 13, the Soviet Union sent a brief note which
                        said it was conducting consultations with India and would inform the U.S. of
                        the results without delay.</p>
                    <p>Early Tuesday morning, December 14, the Soviet Union sent a message which, in
                        addition to some standard Soviet views on the South Asian situation, relayed
                        firm assurances by the Indian leadership that India had no plans of seizing
                        West Pakistani territory or attacking West Pakistan armed forces.</p>
                    <p>Later Tuesday morning, December 14, General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> on instructions from the President called in Charge
                        Vorontsov and made the following points. He said that the President and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> considered the Soviet
                        message vague and imprecise on Indian intentions <pb n="2" xml:id="d73-02" facs="d73-02"/>in West Pakistan. The U.S. had to be clear that the
                        Soviet message included Azad Kashmir and involved a return to the exact
                        borders before the outbreak of hostilities. Mr. Vorontsov expressed his
                        personal understanding that this was precisely the Soviet view. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> stressed that it was the
                        U.S. view that the Soviet Union must move promptly to halt the fighting and
                        that delays could have the most serious impact on U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side will be aware of press reports of the remarks Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> made to journalists on the
                        airplane returning from the Azores that day with regard to the possible
                        impact of Soviet actions on the President's plan to visit Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Upon arrival in Washington on December 14, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> called in Charge Vorontsov to reiterate and expand
                        on the points made by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        repeated that there must be an understanding that the Indians would not
                        attack West Pakistan, would not seek to acquire Pakistani territory and
                        would return to the territorial limits that existed prior to the crisis. Mr.
                        Vorontsov confirmed this was the Soviet understanding of Indian assurances.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the Soviet
                        Union should be blamed for letting the situation develop because of their
                        massive arms shipments to India and security guarantees. And now Soviet
                        delays in the current situation were making the President question Soviet
                        motives.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d73-03" facs="d73-03"/>
                    <p>On Wednesday morning December 15, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> called in charge Vorontsov again and said that it
                        was time to move, that no more delays were excusable and that if there were
                        not a ceasefire in West Pakistan soon the U.S. would have to draw the
                        appropriate conclusions.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side is, of course, aware of developments in the subcontinent
                        which have subsequently taken place.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. is continuing to encourage other nations to assist Pakistan along
                        the lines previously outlined to the Chinese side. Jordan has now sent
                        fourteen aircraft to Pakistan and is considering sending three more.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side will continue to keep the Chinese side informed on this
                        situation. It is the U.S. view that recent events in South Asia involve
                        sobering conclusions. The governments of the People's Republic of China and
                        the United States should not again find themselves in a position where
                        hostile global aims can be furthered through the use of proxy countries.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> during his January
                        visit to China will be prepared to discuss this problem and possible efforts
                        designed to prevent similar events in the future.</p>

                    <p>20 December 1971</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD</p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: 28th Meeting with the Chinese in Paris. 18 December 1971 1100</p>
                    <p>Almost as soon as I walked in the door of my office coming from Orly Airport
                        and the United States I received a phone call from Tsao enquiring whether I
                        was actually coming at 1100 that morning. I assured him that I was and it
                        was quite obvious that they were anxious to see me.</p>
                    <p>At that time I went to the Chinese Embassy Residence in Neuilly using the
                        usual precautions in order not to be too obvious and was received there in
                        accordance with the usual protocolary sequence and rites. That is to say Wei
                        at the gate and Tsao at the door and the Ambassador a few moments later in
                        the Red Room. My heart sank as I saw the plates and forks and small glasses
                        for Mai Tai, the Chinese fire and food about which my feelings are somewhat
                        mitigated.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador told me that he had seen me on television in the Azores even
                        though he had not seen me in person for some time. I had been with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Both Tsao and
                            <persName>Wei</persName> added that they too had seen me. This had
                        obviously given my prestige a somewhat needed boost.</p>
                    <p>I then read to the Ambassador the message regarding our activities during the
                        Indo Pakistan War. He said at the end after Wei had translated this that the
                        Social Imperialism of the Soviet Union had dropped its mask and revealed its
                        ugly face to the whole world. He said that the Soviet Union was obviously
                        moving to establish itself on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The threat to
                        China was a permanent one. The Soviets had over a million camped along their
                        border with China and they had also installed missile bases. China was not
                        afraid. She was strong and the Chinese peoples had dug great tunnel cities
                        under their major cities and were quite prepared to face anything that the
                        Soviet Union might do. He noted the Soviet use of the veto to thwart the
                        will of the overwhelming majority of the members of the United Nations.
                        Pakistan had unquestionably been the victim of the crudest kind of
                        aggression. He made no direct comment on the substance of our message, other
                        than to say that he would transmit it to Peking as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>I then handed them the preliminary plans of the building designed to house
                        the Television Production and Transmission Center, as well as the technical
                        date which I had received for them. The Ambassador said that all of this was
                        too technical for him but that he was certain that the Chinese technicians
                        would know what to do with it, particularly when they received the remaining
                        data which we had promised them.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that in my absence Tsao and <persName>Wei</persName>
                        had seen my Secretary Miss Ouellette and had found her most efficient,
                        discreet and to the point.</p>
                    <p>I said that the Chinese action in releasing the American prisoners had been
                        very well received in the United States by all. The prisoners themselves had
                        been discreet and had said nothing that could be interpreted as hostile to
                        China. Such actions were much appreciated by American public opinion.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d74-02" facs="d74-02"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he was glad that after a period of guardedness we
                        had come to speak frankly to one another and he appreciated this. The
                        Ambassador then asked how I viewed the immediate future on the South Asian
                        sub continent. I said that it was difficult to see what the immediate future
                        would bring but it seemed to me speaking on a purely personal basis that we
                        should find means not to be caught in such a disadvantageous position again
                        and that we must find means to prevent aggression from being rewarded. He
                        nodded thoughtfully but made no direct comment.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then turned the conversation into personal channels, Was I
                        tired? How were the Azores? He did not probe to find out what actually went
                        on and asked no questions of substance concerning that meeting. He said that
                        they would be happy to get the remainder of the technical data. I replied
                        that I had been promised that this would be sent along by courier in the
                        next few days and that as soon as I received it I would see that it got into
                        his hands as soon as possible. All of this with cups and cups of tea and
                        wedge after wedge of preserved apples as well as various little pies stuffed
                        with unmentionable unknown chopped you know whats. I was escorted out in the
                        usual reverse sequence to my arrival.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>FROM: <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">HAIG</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>Following my initial interim report, we were suddenly informed that we would
                        be expected in the Great Hall for a meeting with the Acting Foreign
                        Minister, to be followed by a banquet hosted by him. Upon arrival at the
                        Great Hall, we were led into a room containing at least thirty <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials. As soon as we were seated, the
                        Acting Foreign Minister entered and he immediately launched into a
                        propagandistic pitch about the differences between our systems. He also
                        questioned our ability to be able to work with a Socialist Regime and
                        concluded with the standard confessional of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> shortcomings, past mistakes and limited ability to cope
                        with our technology.</p>
                    <p>I put him down rather abruptly and nothing more of the propaganda line was
                        heard. During the banquet, the Acting Foreign Minister who lacks anything of
                        the skill or grace of our other hosts gave a warmly written toast (he did
                        read it) and I followed. All in all, the meeting and banquet were highly
                        successful and seemed to dispose of all preliminary modalities. I then went
                        to my room (we are staying in hotel, not guest house). At 2345 hours, as I
                        was about to fall asleep, <pb n="2" xml:id="d75-02" facs="d75-02"/>Mr. Han
                        Su, the Protocol Chief, arrived and informed me I was to meet with the Prime
                        Minister immediately. He informed me, contrary to my earlier request, that
                        others would be present. Upon arriving at the Great Hall at midnight,
                        flanked only by Muriel, I was greeted by <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> with Acting Foreign Minister Fei, the Vice Foreign
                        Minister, Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName> and Protocol
                        Chief Han Su. Nancy Tang served as interpreter. At this point, it was
                        obvious that <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> had no intention of
                        meeting alone with me. Therefore, for better or worse, I proceeded after an
                        exchange of pleasantries, to deliver the points we discussed at Key
                        Biscayne. Because of the audience, I was slightly more circumspect on
                        several minor points. Nevertheless, I adhered religiously to the substance
                        we discussed. Throughout, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        listened intently, nodding agreement on most issues and correcting Nancy's
                        Chinese when she failed to precisely translate a particular phrase or
                        sentence. All this took about an hour and one half and interruptions were
                        very few. Then <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> lucidly replied in
                        an objective and friendly style. Verbatim text follows:</p>
                    <p>“C: I thank you for your rather clear notification. Of course, you have said
                        you have not gone into great detail but we understand the general idea. And,
                        of course, we must report this to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                            Tse-tung</persName> and also must consult with other colleagues.
                        Therefore, I am not able to <pb n="3" xml:id="d75-03" facs="d75-03"/>give an
                        official reply. However, I would like to comment on what you have said. The
                        first thing is just as you mentioned that the coming together of our two
                        countries would be beneficial to the promotion of the normalization of
                        relations between our two countries and also to the relaxation of tension in
                        the Far East. We believe this will not only be beneficial to the U.S. but
                        also to the People's Republic of China and also to the peoples of our two
                        countries and to the people in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>“The second point is that Soviet meddling in the South Asian subcontinent and
                        in Indochina, in my opinion, is not due to a change in the strategic
                        policies of the Soviet Union but rather a necessary consequence of reaction
                        on the part of the Soviet Union toward the coming closer between China and
                        the United States. And I mentioned this to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> during his first visit to China—that we were
                        anticipating to shoulder, to bear the consequences of this coming together
                        of U.S. and China and that we were prepared for this and we do not,
                        therefore, find it to be unexpected. For instance, the question of the
                        subcontinent. It was because the Sino-American Communique of July 15—the
                        first announcement of July 15th, your time, was published that the
                        Soviet-Indian Treaty, a so-called treaty which was actually a military
                        alliance, came into being after having been delayed for two years. It was
                        finally signed in Delhi in August and it <pb n="4" xml:id="d75-04" facs="d75-04"/>can be said that Pakistan did not deal with that very
                        earnestly at that time.</p>
                    <p>“Of course, this is not something that either China or the United States
                        could do for them as their friend. And, therefore, when later on in
                        December, the situation had already become rather urgent, when we heard of
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s information about the
                        policy as adopted by the United States, we considered that although it was
                        rather late at that time already, we considered that that was the only
                        possible policy that could be adopted at that time. Of course, now, the
                        question of the subcontinent has become complicated. And we believe that it
                        will continue to develop. And if the United States Government has any other
                        new further opinion with regard to this situation, we are willing to hear
                        it. Because the obstruction of India's advance toward West Pakistan is only
                        a temporary phenomenon. And with the development of the already complex
                        situation on the subcontinent, will undergo still more changes. And,
                        therefore, if the interim period from now until the visit of your President
                        to China, if the U.S. Government has any new information it would like to
                        convey, we are willing to exchange opinions on the situation in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>“I would like to say also, very frankly, that our opinions differ from yours
                        on Vietnam. We believe that it was not necessary for the U.S. Government to
                        bomb North Vietnam in such a way as <pb n="5" xml:id="d75-05" facs="d75-05"/>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has never done
                        since he has taken office, as he did around Christmas last year. And, in
                        addition, this action was taken after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had withdrawn I believe around 400,000 troops from
                        South Vietnam, and, therefore, this action made it even more unacceptable to
                        the people of the world, including the people of the United States and this
                        was also reflected in the press of the United States. And this also occurred
                        at precisely the time when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> declared to the world around Christmas that he wised
                        to move toward relaxation of tension and toward peace in the world. And if
                        we should say that Soviet forces in the Indian Ocean and in the South Asian
                        subcontinent have increased, we should say that the Soviet Union was given
                        an opportunity to increase its influence and its force in the Democratic
                        Republic of Vietnam then we should say that it was assisted by the recent
                        action of the United States. Because as I remember, when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was here discussing things with
                        us, he expressed particular admiration and appreciation of the fifth point
                        put forth by Madame Binh of the Republic of Vietnam. The basic spirit of
                        that clause was to change South Vietnam and Indochina into a non-allied
                        area, ie.e, an area which would maintain peaceful and friendly relations
                        with all sides. And this would be beneficial to <pb n="6" xml:id="d75-06" facs="d75-06"/>the relaxation of tension in Southeast Asia. It would
                        also be beneficial to the improvement of relations between the United States
                        and China. However, now the U.S. bombing has increased the Soviet influence
                        and tension in this area. Of course, this is not of great consequence to us
                        but it is quite bad for the local area. It will make the situation in all of
                        Southeast Asia tense and it will also be a matter of great concern to the
                        people of the U.S. and the world and it will not be favorable toward the
                        ending of the war in that area.</p>
                    <p>“Originally, we were waiting to convey these views to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> when they come alter on but since you have now
                        mentioned, we think this is also another opportunity to advance some of our
                        opinions. Of course, this is also just an initial exchange and I believe we
                        will have another opportunity to exchange opinions. And, of course, as you
                        said, this exchange is limited to us two.</p>
                    <p>“And as for the third factor, we have taken into consideration the fact that
                        you have certain internal problems which we see from the press and also Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned it during his
                        previous visits and we have also felt the three forces which you mentioned.
                        I would also like to ask something very bluntly and to you as you are a
                        military man. <pb n="7" xml:id="d75-07" facs="d75-07"/>Is it that the
                        Pentagon also has differing opinions?”</p>
                    <p>“H: Some elements in the Pentagon have differing opinions but those who are
                        the most responsible and strategic thinkers are in full agreement with this
                        initiative and the visit of the President.”</p>
                    <p>“C: As for the two questions—the two issues that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> raised about the joint
                        communique.</p>
                    <p>“The first is essentially a question of trade. We understand this proposal
                        and we can also see from American opinion that they are also attaching
                        importance to this question and this is also an issue that carries
                        weight.</p>
                    <p>“The second is the suggestion you have brought from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> about the wording of the part
                        about Taiwan. In our opinion, the paragraph that we have written down—I am
                        not speaking about the part the Chinese says but the part that the U.S. side
                        says. We believe that in the wording of that part we have fully taken into
                        consideration the present dilemma that you just now mentioned between the
                        United States Government and the forces you mention from the Left and the
                        Right because this is a force of crucial significance to the United States
                        but since you have brought a new opinion, we would be willing to take it
                        into consideration, because as we have mentioned before we are always <pb n="8" xml:id="d75-08" facs="d75-08"/>willing to get the work done as
                        best as possible because you must work with a view toward the future. And
                        also Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has already given
                        some hints about this question to the press —- five points, isn't that
                        so?”</p>
                    <p>“H: Five points?”</p>
                    <p>“C: You have not seen them? A Minister of Japan—we found it in the Japanese
                        press. They were representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party—the
                        leader of that party.”</p>
                    <p>“H: He did talk to him.”</p>
                    <p>“C: And he announced these five points to the Japanese pres.”</p>
                    <p>“H: I don't recall Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> using
                        five points.”</p>
                    <p>“C: We have been trying to get a copy.”</p>
                    <p>“H: I will find out about that. I did not sit in at the meeting.”</p>
                    <p>“C: We will try to get a copy and give you an English translation. Of course,
                        it quoted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and these
                        words came from the Japanese. As for the specific questions you later
                        mentioned (administrative questions), we don't think there is any question
                        to that because we believe during his second visit Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned these points. I believe
                        we can cooperate very well on them. Of course, you can continue discussions
                        with Acting Foreign Minister Fei, either directly or you can have separate
                        group discussions with various other people. Of course, <pb n="9" xml:id="d75-09" facs="d75-09"/>we will not do anything to embarrass you
                        and if anything comes up at lower levels, they will not be settled there.
                        They will be brought to you.</p>
                    <p>“As for your plans for this present visit to China, there are two
                        suggestions. One was that you would spend a greater portion of your time in
                        Peking and then go to Shanghai and Hangchow and come back here. In my
                        personal opinion, it would be better to have all issues decided in Peking
                        and then go to other places. It would be economizing on the time. But, of
                        course, if you would like to wait for a reply from Washington before you
                        would like to finalize certain details or if you have other political
                        matters to discuss later on, then a return trip would be better. Either
                        question is entirely up to you to decide.”</p>
                    <p>“H: I think, at first glance, we would favor a longer time here and then the
                        trip to the other two locations and depart from there. I think we will know
                        that better after we have had discussions of the schedule tomorrow morning
                        at the plenary sessions, after which we could decide. But I believe that
                        this would be the best way to proceed.”</p>
                    <p>“C: I am sorry to have taken up too much of your sleep.”</p>
                    <p>“H: I am honored that you have taken this time to see me.”</p>
                    <p>“C: I am also very happy to have been able to meet you. Anyway, if you are
                        going to contact Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>,
                        please send my regards to him.”</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d75-10" facs="d75-10"/>
                    <p>“H: I will do so.”</p>
                    <p>From the preceding, it is clear that Chou's assessment of South Asia is more
                        precise but not incompatible with the one I presented. His assessment of the
                        bombing sounded like it was mostly for the records though not altogether. He
                        never answered the issue on why Hanoi has failed to respond to our
                        initiative. On more positive elements to the communique, including trade, I
                        think we can count on some movement. On Taiwan, he was less forthcoming but
                        I believe here too we can achieve an acceptable compromise. The questions
                        the Chinese will wish answered as soon as possible are how we should proceed
                        during this visit on:</p>
                    <p>a. Further exchanges of views on South Asia. (I believe the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> will definitely cause some trouble in East
                        Pakistan and have now put us on notice).</p>
                    <p>b. Further exchange of views on Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>c. New language for the positive portions of the communique.</p>
                    <p>d. New language in communique on Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>e. Our trip schedule.</p>
                    <p>Regarding a above, you can judge better than I whether you wish to provide
                        more views. I recommend that I merely tell <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> I have nothing further but should something develop you
                        will send via Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>Regarding b above, recommend same as a.</p>
                    <p>Regarding c above, I believe you should consider some language changes and
                        bring them in February. I would tell <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        that we are doing so <pb n="11" xml:id="d75-11" facs="d75-11"/>and request
                        they do likewise but hold on further exchanges of views until President's
                        trip.</p>
                    <p>Regarding d above, press no further since we left ad referendum new language
                        for them to consider which they promised to do.</p>
                    <p>Regarding e above, we can best settle here based on tomorrow's meeting and
                        assessment of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s attitude on President
                        and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s schedule.</p>
                    <p>After eighteen straight thrilling hours, I'm going to bed. Muriel won't be so
                        fortunate.</p>
                    <p>Warm regards.</p>

                        RATHER TO BE SURE WE ARE PREPARED TO MAKE POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS IN FEBRUARY.
                        THE PRIME MINISTER ALSO NOTED HIS WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER OUR FURTHER VIEWS

                    </p>
                    <p>REF: Peking #2</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your cables which I read with interest and not a little
                        nostalgia.</p>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, you have handled yourself ably and with discretion.</p>
                    <p>I agree with your line of procedure.</p>
                    <p>— On the communique the ball is in their court. The trade section can wait
                        till we get there as long as they understand what we have in mind.</p>
                    <p>An additional area for strengthening is cultural and scientific exchanges
                        where we might mention some specific projects. Please raise this.</p>
                    <p>— On Taiwan, you should take any counter draft ad referendum. They do not
                        want to use Paris channel for this so do not suggest it.</p>
                    <p>— With respect to South Asia you can tell them we will communicate further
                        thoughts through Paris channel. At present the primary objective is to gain
                        time and to arm Pakistan. We have used our influence with Turkey and France
                        in this regard; we welcome any <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> efforts.
                        We are starting economic assistance programs again and on larger scale.</p>
                    <p>— With respect to Southeast Asia you should stress that in our view Moscow is
                        blocking negotiated settlement. We have made sweeping proposal; Hanoi
                        cancelled meeting set for November 20. You can reaffirm everything <pb n="2" xml:id="d77-02" facs="d77-02"/>I said on my visits, particularly our
                        readiness to accept non-aligned Southeast Asia. The only reason in our view
                        the war continues is for Soviet, not U.S., aims. No patriotic Vietnamese
                        need fear our eventual domination.</p>
                    <p>— I am puzzled by reference to Japanese Social Democrat. Given Japanese
                        propensity to leak, you can be sure I said nothing. Memcon is being sent to
                        you separately. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> may have
                        obliquely asked for reaffirmation of my commitments to him.</p>
                    <p>—Withdrawal of Southeast Asian related part of forces within a reasonable
                        period after end of Indochina war.</p>
                    <p>— Gradual withdrawal of remainder as tensions ease.</p>
                    <p>— No support for Japanese return to Formosa or introduction of Japanese
                        troops there.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes, we had a most enjoyable
                        visit there. It was just marvelous and extremely educational.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I will do what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> did while he was here—put on
                        weight. First, Mr. Minister, I thought I would like to just reiterate and
                        reemphasize personally that I am very grateful for the personal
                        cooperativeness that we are receiving at every level from your people. I am
                        somewhat embarrassed to find that some of our people, have come with all the
                        answers and have not operated with as much efficiency as I would have
                        preferred. This has required additional patience and assistance from your
                        side which has certainly not been lacking.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                        <persName>Chi</persName>: I heard that they have had rather smooth and
                        rather good discussions in the groups.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_Gen1">Gen</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Everything has been superior
                        in the exchange of views but I find that the network people have sometimes
                        not performed as effectively as I would have liked.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                        <persName>Chi</persName>: They seem to be doing alright.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_Gen1">Gen</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: You are too kind. I did have
                        some other followup information to our meetings of early Tuesday morning
                        with the Prime Minister, I immediately reported in great detail that morning
                        to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> the results of the
                        discussions with the Prime Minister. And he replied to me first that he
                        received my report with no little nostalgia and he felt that in replying to
                        my message that he wanted to again extend his personal greetings to each of
                        you that had worked with him so cooperatively and in such a friendly spirit
                        in October and July.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                        <persName>Chi</persName>: We would also like to thank him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_Gen1">Gen</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: One of the first items I
                        mentioned to the Prime Minister was our hope that we could strengthen the
                        positive actions of the Draft Communique. And when the Prime Minister
                        replied to me he mentioned that this was primarily a problem of trade. I
                        wanted to reemphasize that we were thinking also of cultural and scientific
                        exchanges between the two sides—that we might wish to consider improved
                        language with respect to these two items as well as trade. In line with
                        this, when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the
                        President come in February, they will have some additional proposals for
                        exchange in the cultural and scientific area, as well as some ideas for your
                        consideration in the area of trade, recognizing that this must come very
                        slowly and it is not the kind of thing we would anticipate immediate action
                        on but maybe some words of future promise. And we would welcome if between
                        now and the visit you care to communicate further on this, perhaps in the
                        Paris channel or, if you prefer, to wait until the party arrives and there
                        could be some further discussion.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the draft alternative language I left ad referendum with respect
                        to the U.S. portion of the paragraph on Taiwan, we would welcome any
                        additional views which your side might have before I return to the United
                        States and we would be prepared to accept and consider any additional or
                        alternate language that you might care to give before I leave. In any event,
                        we would anticipate that this subject would always be the result of direct
                        exchanges here in Peking between you and myself while I am here or Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the President after
                        they arrive.</p>
                    <p>Now, also, during the meeting on Tuesday morning, the Prime Minister conveyed
                        the thought that he would welcome any additional views we have on the
                        subject of South Asia and the subcontinent before any meetings with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. With your side's
                        approval, we would like to send some additional views on this subject
                        through the Paris channel between now and the 21st of February. And for now,
                        I would like to emphasize that our policies there will focus on efforts to
                        buy time and to strengthen the defense capabilities of Pakistan. We
                        certainly share the Prime Minister's concern that that situation is far from
                        settled and is still in a period of dynamism which will require the most
                        careful watching and perhaps action on both our parts. We have been using
                        our influence just before and since the cease-fire to get Turkey and France
                        to help in the arms situation in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                        <persName>Chi</persName>: Turkey and France?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_Gen1">Gen</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes. Turkey and France and
                        this was a topic discussed between Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> in
                        the Azores. Concurrently, we are starting up our economic program for
                        Pakistan at a greater level of assistance than heretofore. Now, turning to
                        the topic of Southeast Asia which was also discussed with the Prime Minister
                        on Tuesday morning, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has
                        asked me to reiterate our government's view that it is Moscow which is
                        blocking the arrival at a peaceful negotiated settlement of the conflict. He
                        has asked me to recount in somewhat greater detail the sweeping proposals
                        which we have made in search of a settlement of the conflict. We had, as I
                        stated earlier, a meeting scheduled for the 20th of November with
                        representatives of Hanoi in Paris. They cancelled that meeting and since
                        that time, we have heard nothing from Hanoi. Vietnam, as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated in October, is an
                        anguishing problem for our government. In this sense, it was not the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration that got us
                        into the conflict but he, of course, has the problem of terminating the
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has also asked me to
                        emphasize that when he met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName> in Paris in July, after the visit to Peking, be informed
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> that the United States
                        wished to end the war in Hanoi and not in Peking. During the past year, we
                        have done the following specific things with respect to the conflict:</p>
                    <p>- On May 31st of last year, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> met with Minister <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan
                            Thuy</persName> and proposed seven U.S. points for ending the war. One
                        of these points was an offer on our part to set a deadline for our
                        withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>- Then, on June 26th, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName>
                        came to Paris and met secretly with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. At that time, Hanoi proposed nine points in reply
                        to the seven points we had proposed in May.</p>
                    <p>- Then, on July 1st, Madame Binh published here seven points and as Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out to the
                        Prime Minister in October it was very odd procedure from our perspective to
                        be given nine points secretly and seven points publicly.</p>
                    <p>- So, on July 12th, on his return from Peking, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> in Paris, again secretly, and at
                        this meeting we inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName> which we should deal with the nine points or the seven
                        points and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> said the
                        nine points were more significant—the ones we had gotten secretly. In view
                        of that response, it was very difficult for us to deal publicly with the
                        seven points of Madame Binh when we were told that the more significant
                        points were the nine secret points given by Mr. Le Due Tho.</p>
                    <p>- Despite the confusion that came from these different views, on August 16th,
                        we made a formal eight point proposal which constituted our reply to the
                        secret nine points, as well as a reply to the seven points made publicly by
                        Madame Birth. In this reply in August, we actually went very far toward the
                        seven and nine points of the other side and even included their specific
                        language in our proposal on several of the key points.</p>
                    <p>- On September 13th, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        again went to Paris secretly. On this occasion, as on the preceding occasion
                        in August, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> found it
                        inconvenient to come from Hanoi to meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and, instead, he met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName>. Nevertheless, at this meeting,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName> rejected two of the
                        eight points Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had
                        forwarded in August. As a result of this rejection, we then reformulated
                        those two points and submitted eight new points on October 11. Of those
                        eight points, six are identical to those already accepted by Hanoi, and the
                        other two points constituted reformulation of the points which Hanoi had
                        rejected in September.</p>
                    <p>- We then requested a secret meeting on November 1. As I pointed out earlier,
                        since then we have had no substantive reply or exchange from Hanoi. In our
                        view, our proposal of October went as far as anyone could possibly go. So,
                        we were faced with intransigence not after we struck North Vietnam in
                        December but well before. Among the proposals we offered in October were the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>1. A specific offer for a fixed date for the withdrawal of our forces.</p>
                    <p>2. The provisions for new elections six months after a peace treaty would be
                        signed.</p>
                    <p>3. A specific offer that all American troops would be withdrawn one month
                        before this election.</p>
                    <p>4. The specific offer that the President and the Vice President of Vietnam
                        would resign one month before the election so that they would not run
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this proposal, the United States reiterated to Hanoi and
                        reiterates here, our readiness to accept a post-settlement nonaligned
                        Southeast Asia. Specifically, what we visualized under our proposal would be
                        the immediate signature of a statement of principles by both sides on which
                        a settlement would be based. We would then withdraw all American forces
                        except a few thousand within seven months of the signing of these
                        principles. And we would do this even before the signature of a final peace
                        treaty. There is also the provision for an all-around cease-fire and the
                        resignation one month before the election of President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and his Vice President. Therefore, in
                        the broadest sense we feel we have replied positively to every demand that
                        Hanoi has made that is reasonable and does not constitute a direct
                        humiliation of the United States as a world power. It is this sequence of
                        events which has led to the conclusion on our part that the war continues in
                        Southeast Asia only for Soviet aims. Certainly, no Asian power or no
                        patriotic Vietnamese element can fear our eventual domination. It is
                        interesting that just this week we have learned that New Delhi is going to
                        upgrade its representation in Hanoi very soon. And certainly this is an
                        ominous further clarification of what Soviet aims must be along the southern
                        flank of the People's Republic of China. I will not elaborate further on
                        this topic during my visit but I would hope that there could be some very
                        frank exchange of views on some of the more recent indications of increased
                        Soviet strategy of encirclement.</p>
                    <p>Now, also during Tuesday morning's meeting, the Prime Minister raised the
                        December 16, 1971 issue of the Japanese Weekly Shuhan Gendai, a copy of
                        which was furnished to me yesterday (attached). This was an article
                        allegedly written by the Director of Propaganda for the Democratic Socialist
                        Party of Japan. The article also allegedly portrayed the substance of a
                        discussion between Mr. Kasuga and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Washington. As I confirmed on Tuesday morning
                        to the Prime Minister, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        had met with Mr. Kasuga in Washington. However, that meeting lasted just 30
                        minutes, not two hours as the article indicates. During the meeting, Mr.
                        Kasuga raised several questions associated with the President's visit here
                        to Peking and persisted strongly in attempting to get some U.S. view on
                        Taiwan from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I have
                        informed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> of the
                        contents of this article following the discussion Tuesday morning with the
                        Prime Minister, and he has replied by providing me with a text of the
                        precise minutes of his meeting with Mr. Kasuga. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also has reiterated personally to
                        me, in addition to providing me with the minutes, that he gave no reply to
                        Mr. Kasuga with respect to the future status of Taiwan. My personal review
                        of the minutes of that meeting confirm categorically that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> deflected all questions on the
                        subject. Instead, be referred to his press conference which occurred on the
                        Tuesday before the December 3rd meeting with Mr. Kasuga and offered to give
                        him a copy of that press conference, with which I know you are familiar. In
                        commenting on the Japanese press article, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked me to convey the following message to the
                        Prime Minister. In Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        view, the only press which is less reliable than our own is that of the
                        Japanese. He also asked me to reiterate again what I stated on Tuesday
                        morning to the Prime Minister and in somewhat more detail concerning our
                        view on the future of Taiwan. Tuesday morning, I cited three specific
                        policies of the United States with respect to Taiwan. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has reformulated these assurances
                        in terms of five specific points. First, the United States will withdraw
                        Southeast Asian-related forces within a reasonable period after the end of
                        the Indochina war. Second, the United States will gradually withdraw the
                        reminder of its forces as tensions ease. Third, the United States will give
                        no support to the return of the Japanese presence in Formosa or to the
                        introduction of Japanese troops in that location. Fourth, the United States
                        will make no further reference to the status of Formosa as being
                        undetermined. And, fifth, the United States will offer no encouragement to
                        the so-called Taiwan independence movement. This is the essence of the
                        guidance I have received from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and I think completes the response to all of the
                        untended issues which arose on Tuesday morning.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s message. And I will
                        convey it to Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. And
                        if Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> has any
                        considerations of any other discussions or any other messages we will
                        further inform you. So, there is nothing further on our side.</p>

                        about the networks portion. Everything else has gone beautifully and I think
                        we are in very good shape. There are some unsettled problems in terms of
                        television coverage. I am hoping it will be resolved this morning. If not,
                        we may have to delay 24 hours. I hope this does not occur because I know
                        this is a terrible burden on you and I am very anxious for us to finish on

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>: We gave you too much wine
                        today? Our hosts did not know how to make conversation, so they just drowned
                        you in wine. I believe Mr. <persName>Chapin</persName> can down quite a few
                        cups. General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> has quite a
                        capacity. It is alright—you are quite young.</p>
                    <p>This afternoon, Acting Foreign Minister Fei conveyed to me the message from
                        Dr. Kisinger that you conveyed to him. I thank you for your information. I
                        already said, on the morning of the 4th, that after I reported to Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> I would discuss it
                        with my colleagues and give you a formal reply. So I would like, first of
                        all, to give a reply to the former message you gave on the morning of the
                        4th and then to deal with the latter message given this morning—later
                        on.</p>
                    <p>We have studied the message conveyed by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. Your straightforwardness has
                        helped us to attain a clearer understanding of the views of the <pb n="2" xml:id="d79-02" facs="d79-02"/>U.S. side on the current situation and
                        Sino-Soviet ways. We would like to express our views in a similarly frank
                        way.</p>
                    <p>1. The high level talks to be held between China and the United States to
                        seek normalization of the relations between the two countries accord with
                        the desire of the Chinese and American people and if positive results can be
                        achieved they will also be conducive to the easing of tension in the Far
                        East and in conformity with the interests of the people in Asia and the
                        world. As the time for the talks draws near, certain hostile forces have
                        been intensifying their destruction and sabotage. This is something within
                        our expectations and we are prepared for it.</p>
                    <p>2. After the announcement of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China, the Soviet Government hastily made
                        concessions in Europe and came to agreement with the West on the Berlin
                        question. While in Asia, it concluded with India a Treaty of peace,
                        friendship and cooperation in name but it was a military alliance in
                        substance. Following that, the Soviet Government took advantage of the
                        situation to support India, to commit armed aggression against Pakistan and
                        occupy East Pakistan. This is a continuation, under new circumstances, of
                        the consistent Soviet policy of contending for hegemony. There is no shift
                        of strategy to speak of. China is under no commitment to Pakistan. However,
                        proceeding from its current principal stand, China has rendered and will
                        continue to render political support and also materiel assistance within our
                        capacity to Pakistan in its struggle against division and aggression. The
                        Soviet Union has supported India to invade and occupy East Pakistan. They
                        appeared arrogant and unbridled for a time but in fact they have further
                        opened their <pb n="3" xml:id="d79-03" facs="d79-03"/>expansionist situation
                        and, in fact, have become isolated from the entire world. The development of
                        events are proving that the subcontinent will be in continuous turmoil.
                        India and its supporter have the nooses around their own necks. They will
                        certainly suffer from the consequences of their own doing.</p>
                    <p>3. There exist fundamental differences between China and the U. S. on the
                        question of Vietnam and Indochina. After Christmas, the United States
                        wantonly bombed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This has shocked world
                        opinion and aroused world opposition. The self-justification made by the
                        United States side is utterly untenable. As victims of the war of
                        aggression, the Vietnamese people have the right to take every necessary
                        action in self defense. China firmly supports their struggle. If the United
                        States truly has the desire to withdraw all its forces and end the war in
                        Vietnam, there is no reason for them to refuse to accept the reasonable
                        sevenpoint proposal put forward by the North Vietnamese side. In fact, it is
                        not Hanoi that is humiliating the United States but the United States that
                        is insulting Hanoi. By what logic may a big country willfully commit
                        aggression against a small country while the self-defense by a small country
                        be described as aggression? This policy of the U.S. can in no way shape the
                        firm resolve of the peoples of Vietnam and other Asian countries to fight
                        and win. On the contrary, it has created obstacles to the U.S. to the
                        withdrawal of troops and to its efforts to obtain release of the <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s. And has also brought an unfavorable
                        element into the visit of the President of the United States to the People's
                        Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>4. China is a big country but not yet a very strong one. Economically, we are
                        still very backward. One half a year ago, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> described China as one of the five
                        great powers of the <pb n="4" xml:id="d79-04" facs="d79-04"/>world but now
                        in its message the United States side, all of a sudden, expresses doubt over
                        China's viability, asserting that it wants to maintain China's independence
                        and viability. We are surprised at this. We hold that no country should ever
                        rely on external forces to maintain its independence and viability. If it
                        does so, it can only become a protectorate or a colony. However small a
                        country may be, so long as it fears no brute force and dares to struggle, it
                        will be able always to stay on its own feet in the family of nations.
                        Vietnam is a vivid case in point. Socialist New China was born and has grown
                        up in continuous struggle against foreign oppression and aggression and will
                        continue to live on and develop. We have long stated that we are prepared to
                        meet enemy invasions from all sides and fight to the very end—not flinching
                        from undertaking the greatest national sacrifice and make contribution to
                        the human progress. Facts have proved and will continue to prove that all
                        schemes to isolate, encircle, contain and subvert China will only end up in
                        ignominious defeat.</p>
                    <p>5. The relations between China and the United States have not been normal.
                        Nevertheless, the Chinese side will receive President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> with due protocol and courtesy and
                        will make its efforts to seek positive results in the Sino-United States
                        talks. In its message, the United States side expressed the wish that the
                        image of the President as a world leader should be enhanced through the
                        visit. This we find it difficult to understand. The image of a man depends
                        on his own deeds and not on any other factors. We do not believe that any
                        world leader can be self styled.</p>
                    <p>6. In its message, the United States side indicated that certain forces in
                        the United States <pb n="5" xml:id="d79-05" facs="d79-05"/>are opposed to
                        the normalization of Sino-United States relations and the Sino-United States
                        high level talks and asked the Chinese side to reconsider the language of
                        the Draft Communique with regard to a certain portion on Taiwan. Of course,
                        we do not object to further consultations but we would. like to point out
                        that we have already done our best to take your difficulties into
                        consideration in our draft. As you know, the Chinese people feel very
                        strongly about the Taiwan question. If the United States side truly has the
                        desire to improve Sino-United States relations, it should adopt a positive
                        attitude of settling this issue which is the crucial question in Sino-United
                        States relations. If there is yielding to certain forces opposed to the
                        normalization of Sin-oUnited States relations and backing down from the
                        former position, that will bring no benefit to China and the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>So that is our comment to the oral message you conveyed on the morning of the
                        4th. Of course, you mentioned some new matters this morning. The first thing
                        is that of trade and I remember very clearly that your Excellency conveyed
                        in your message the wishes of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> with regard to that matter. And I said that we had
                        noted the opinion of the United States side and we would consider putting it
                        into the Joint Communique. There is no question that the relations between
                        China and the United States have not been normalized and that the
                        development of trade will be limited and slow. However, we should look
                        further to the future and the relations between China and the United
                        States—should proceed in a direction headed for normalization and the matter
                        of trade should be viewed as a positive factor in this progress. And since
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has mentioned cultural
                        and scientific exchanges, if he has any specific idea, <pb n="6" xml:id="d79-06" facs="d79-06"/>of course we would be willing to exchange
                        opinion on these matters during the discussions.</p>
                    <p>The second question is the matter of the South Asian subcontinent that you
                        mentioned in the message you conveyed from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. We appreciate the part of the message in which
                        you mentioned that the United States side at present would wish to count on
                        gaining time to enhance the self-defense of Pakistan and that the United
                        States was willing to undertake an economic assistance towards Pakistan. As
                        for the other portions, they were a sort of explanation and as I have
                        already answered them previously, I feel them to be redundant. And as
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> has in the early
                        hours of the 4th very straightforwardly conveyed President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s message to us, I would like to request your
                        Excellency to report the reply we have just given you in a similarly
                        straightforward manner to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I am very grateful for the
                        very detailed and very frank views which I will convey precisely as received
                        to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and to the
                        President. As I pointed out at the time I gave those views, they were views
                        which were largely conveyed in my own language as I understood the general
                        thrust of my instructions. In several instances, I believe the simple
                        language of a soldier might have been more blunt than it might have been. I
                        believe some of my words may have been misinterpreted. I would also like to
                        briefly discuss your reply from a personal point of view because I have not
                        been able to discuss the matter personally with the President or Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>First, with respect to the situation in Southeast Asia, I believe it is very
                        helpful to exchange views <pb n="7" xml:id="d79-07" facs="d79-07"/>even
                        though it appears we basically disagree on this subject. From our
                        perspective, and this is a problem I have been very very close to for the
                        last three years, it is not United States forces that are in Laos or United
                        States forces that are in Cambodia but North Vietnamese forces. We have
                        expressed our desire to withdraw our forces and we have made honorable
                        conscientious proposals that would lead to that withdrawal and a settlement.
                        It is the other side that has not responded to these proposals. I think I
                        explained that we were told to pay attention to the nine points given to us
                        secretly by Hanoi and that is the way we have proceeded, based on advice
                        from Hanoi's spokesman. Even so, this is a topic that I think warrants more
                        extensive exchange at the time of the President's visit. I do believe that
                        in the long run our perception of the convergence of the interests of the
                        United States and the People's Republic of China in the area of Southeast
                        Asia is the ultimate truth.</p>
                    <p>The second point is the terminology that I used concerning the viability and
                        independence of the People's Republic of China. Certainly, we would not
                        presume to infer that we were assuming the role of the protector or the
                        guarantor of China's viability. On the other hand, we did want to make very
                        clear, and perhaps I did it clumsily, that in our perspective China's
                        viability and future health is of interest to the United States. This is a
                        matter of our own national interest in the context of the world situation as
                        it has developed.</p>
                    <p>The third point I would like to mention is the again unfortunate language
                        which suggests that the imagery of the President was an important item. This
                        was meant only in the context of the preparations we are making for the
                        President's visit. I <pb n="8" xml:id="d79-08" facs="d79-08"/>think it is
                        important that we do not afford our enemies an opportunity to attack the
                        President either in terms of his motivation or his effectiveness during his
                        visit. The worst disservice I could do to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would be to suggest that his public
                        image is a matter of concern to him or a matter which influences his
                        decision on any given substance. Certainly, his performance in the
                        international arena thus far suggests that popularity has never been, nor
                        will ever be, the criteria by which he makes his decisions.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the issue of Taiwan, I immediately conveyed to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> the reply that I received from
                        you on Tuesday morning and he is, I think, very much aware of that reply. He
                        did provide this additional information today, primarily to answer the
                        questions that came up Tuesday and not to elevate our discussions here to a
                        dialogue that would go on continuously but, hopefully, to elaborate on those
                        issues which might have required clarification based on the discussion of
                        Tuesday morning.</p>
                    <p>On the three subjects that we discussed that our side hoped could be more
                        positive in the communique, i.e., trade, scientific and cultural matters, I
                        am confident that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will
                        come up with some very modest proposals because he realizes that that
                        portion of the communique is balanced and very well worked out. I do not
                        expect any drastic revision to the communique in this respect and we
                        recognize the issue of trade is a long term one.</p>
                    <p>And finally, on the subject of the South Asian subcontinent, I think recent
                        events have confirmed one thing to me from my humble perspective and that is
                        that while forces are sometimes under way <pb n="9" xml:id="d79-09" facs="d79-09"/>that we would like to think our own good intentions may
                        somehow control, the facts are sometimes quite to the contrary. In South
                        Asia, certainly the United States was slow in recognizing the dangers. I
                        think it behooves both our sides to be equally cognizant of future dangers
                        there and elsewhere and I would hope it would not be a question of looking
                        back on a situation that had turned sour for the lack of timely action which
                        might have prevented that.</p>
                    <p>I again thank the Prime Minister for his very thoughtful treatment to me and
                        my party while we have been here in Peking. One thing has characterized any
                        exchanges I have been involved in with your officials and that has been the
                        degree of candor and frankness which is very encouraging to me. I think both
                        of us have had long standing positions on controversial issues on which we
                        do not agree and would hope those will not be translated too readily
                        into—and to use your term—“empty canons of rhetoric” but rather to the kind
                        of frank language that will minimize misunderstanding even though the
                        disagreement might remain at the conclusion of the discussion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>: Your Excellency has just
                        now commented a bit on our reply and I think I should also like to add a few
                        words. Of course, the reply I gave you just now in itself is a complete
                        answer. And what I am now adding, of course, is additional and it was led to
                        by your comment.</p>
                    <p>And on the question of Southeast Asia, our current opinion has been, to put
                        it simply, that the United States is in the wrong. This is not only the
                        words of the Chinese but also of the other people in the world. I have heard
                        American friends themselves <pb n="10" xml:id="d79-10" facs="d79-10"/>speak
                        of this. And, in addition, this is not something that was created by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> himself. It was his
                        predecessors. And President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has
                        already decided to withdraw his troops. And as I have said to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> before, I would wish that the
                        United States would withdraw completely as General DeGaulle did in Algeria
                        and do it in one strike and cleanly, wholly, without any remainder and
                        immediately. And to find various excuses to drag on in a messy way will only
                        finally end up in losing the initiative. With a subjective wish for a
                        glorious and honorable withdrawal while in reality there may not be such
                        honorable and glorious withdrawal and if you only have the subjective wish
                        but reality is not a glorious and honorable withdrawal, then on the
                        contrary, this might give rise to difficult predicaments that are difficult
                        to extract ones self from. Have you read the Soviet News? That is upon your
                        present visit to China, the Soviet press has done some reporting in which
                        they have given some special descriptions of you as saying that you are
                        especially in charge of Vietnamese and Indochina Affairs. Of course, we do
                        not pay attention to that. It is precisely because you may be in charge of
                        this that I would like to speak to you with special earnestness. That is
                        that your excuses will not carry over with the people of the world. For
                        instance, you said that it was not the United States troops that went first
                        into Laos and Cambodia but North Vietnamese troops. The question is that
                        your troops should not have gone to Vietnam in the first place. The sending
                        of United States troops into Vietnam itself is aggression. For instance, we
                        have a common point in opposing the sending of Indian troops into East
                        Pakistan. Then, how can we agree to your sending troops into South Vietnam.
                        That is why the Soviet Ambassador criticized you on the issue of Vietnam
                        when the question of the war in Pakistan was under debate in the United
                        Nations. That is the first point.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d79-11" facs="d79-11"/>
                    <p>The second point is—take Laos for instance—the troops of Thailand went into
                        Laos. That is also foreign aggression. And your <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has given often air support to the Laotian bandits in the
                        form of ammunition or money or food. They have given this to the Lao bandits
                        of the minority Nationality, the forces of Vang Pao in the area that is
                        under the control of Laos and this is something that is recognized in the
                        American press. Then, since the United States and Thailand can give air
                        support to bandits in Laos, then why can Vietnam not give patriotic
                        assistance to the forces of liberation? For instance, it is the same as the
                        situation in which you assisted South Korea and advanced your forces up to
                        the very banks of the Yellow River. It was only then that we sent our
                        volunteers to assist the Democratic Republic of Korea and when we now cooly
                        assess that situation—was that not very clear? And the case is similar in
                        Cambodia. If the Lon Nol - Matak clique had not subverted <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>, then how would the war in
                        Cambodia have come about?</p>
                    <p>Later on, your President himself decided to send troops on an intrusion into
                        Cambodia. That was at the end of April 1970 and later on in the early part
                        of 1971, United States troops entered into Laos and this was even further
                        aggression and at Christmas last year, you launched a massive air strike
                        against North Vietnam. Your President and your Pentagon have called those
                        successes but, in my opinion, they are not successes. You are a soldier and
                        I also have been one in the past—not now of course. I have also been in
                        military action and I know that this kind of fighting cannot bring victory.
                        It can only give rise to dissatisfaction on the part of ones own people. And
                        these actions on the contrary are giving the Soviet Union an opportunity.
                        And if you want some news, I can tell you a bit that if you do not leave
                        that place, then Southeast Asia which does have the possibility of being
                        turned into an area of nonalignment <pb n="12" xml:id="d79-12" facs="d79-12"/>will become an area of contention between the two superpowers. We are very
                        clear about that. And then Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the
                        subcontinent, the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia will be linked together and
                        how can tension be relaxed and wouldn't that be completely contrary to the
                        ideals of your President. On the morning of the 4th, you told us of the
                        strategic thinking of the President. And you once again mentioned that your
                        President wished to relax the tension but if things go on like that, then
                        the situation that will appear will be completely contrary to those
                        subjective wishes. And the result will be that the situation will continue
                        in continuous turmoil not only in the subcontinent, Of course, the
                        settlement of the Vietnam question will be reached between the United States
                        and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> either in Paris or Hanoi or
                        perhaps in other places. Of course, we, as the third party, cannot meddle in
                        this but we must state clearly our stand and there must be no ambiguity
                        about that. I have dealt in rather great detail on this question in the hope
                        that you will convey this to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. This itself, in fact, constitutes an initial
                        exchange of opinion. Of course, it is probably too long to send in your
                        cables so you can talk about them when you get back and Mrs. Hartley will be
                        tired working on them until tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p>As for the other two questions, there is no need to pay too great attention
                        to the wordings and terminology. We would like you to know that although our
                        country is backward, we have our independence. In our country, we have
                        relied on our own initiative and self-reliance and have relied on these to
                        fight until today. We have our self-dignity and so have you and if we
                        mutually respect each other that is equality. So the erroneous terminology
                        that you just now mentioned is not only a matter of terminology but a matter
                        of attitude. We are not a superpower and we refuse to be a superpower. Your
                        President has mentioned that China is a potential strength power. There is a
                        degree of reason in that.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d79-13" facs="d79-13"/>
                    <p>The third point you mentioned was the image of your President and our reply
                        would be as we have mentioned in the third point of our reply—that the image
                        of a man depends on his own deeds. And since we have invited your President
                        to China, we will certainly give him the protocol and courtesy due him. I
                        don't think there is any question of this and do not believe we have to say
                        more about this because I believe you will understand this through the
                        technical discussions we have had. Of course, it is impossible to go beyond
                        that because we have not established diplomatic relations and you still
                        recognize Taiwan. You must not forget that. It is important to us. The good
                        thing about it is that <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                        also only recognizes one China. He also says Taiwan is a Province of China.
                        It is a good thing because Taiwan would have long ago become a puppet of
                        yours and become another <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> or
                        Sigmund Rhee and if such a situation had occurred wouldn't that make it even
                        more impossible for us to come together and that would bring even more
                        difficulty in the normalization of relations. So now, we have come to the
                        question of Taiwan. So as to the question of Taiwan, I have already dealt
                        with it in the official answer to you and if there is further discussion—if
                        there is still room for individual changes in that part—then they should
                        await the arrival of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. As for the present,
                        we believe that in our draft we have already given very great consideration
                        to your difficulties. As for other specific wordings and various measures,
                        just as I mentioned about trade, cultural and scientific matters, they are
                        rather minor matters and can wait until the arrival of your President. And
                        my secretary has just now called my attention to the fact that you mentioned
                        the fact to pay attention to the danger developing in the subcontinent and
                        you mentioned in the past you had been late in recognizing the danger there.
                        You just now mentioned that in the past you had come to the realization of
                        this danger too late to avoid danger.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d79-14" facs="d79-14"/>
                    <p>As to that question, I have already answered on the morning of the 4th and we
                        have identical views.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I am very grateful for this
                        lengthy discussion. It is presumptious of me to speak for President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I think on the subject of
                        Southeast Asia there will be many useful exchanges during the President's
                        visit. The past history you referred to should be a source of wisdom and
                        learning. It does not necessarily provide the answers to current
                        situations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>: Of course, this answer
                        must be given by your President. I cannot do that for him. For instance, in
                        the instance of the Korean War. We entered into the war against aggression.
                        During that time, the President was Truman who was a Democrat and not a
                        Republican. He still put forth the suggestion of negotiation, so actually
                        they fought one year without negotiations but later on, with your Republican
                        President Eisenhower, he ended the war in Korea. I think it is useful to
                        recall that part of history but the situation in Korea was different from
                        that in Vietnam so it would not do to dogmatically copy that. The war that
                        began in Vietnam has brought the whole of Indochina together, has merged it
                        into one but we have not entered that war so the situation is different. And
                        only with determination and resolve can that situation be settled.
                        Otherwise, you will only lose the initiative.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I think we are convinced
                        that it is going to take bold action and I think we have taken it by
                        offering sweeping proposals. It is somewhat of a puzzle that we have not
                        received a response to those proposals. Perhaps that is where the trouble
                        lies. That is why alternative means must be pursued.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>: That is a question that I
                        cannot answer because the war in Indochina is different from the war in
                        Korea. In the case of Korea, on our side the Democratic people of <pb n="15" xml:id="d79-15" facs="d79-15"/>Korea were the main representatives and
                        our representatives were their deputies. On the other side, the United
                        States was the main representative while Sigmund Rhee was the deputy, so
                        actually there were four sides and in that circumstance it was easier for us
                        to get an opinion. Now you are discussing face to face. So, I will not take
                        up more of your time from your sleep.</p>

                    <p>Dear Dick:</p>
                    <p>Per our conversation a few minutes ago enclosed are the two documents I
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>— The document at Tab I substitutes for the enclosure (”proposal”) to the
                        note at Tab A of my letter dated January 24 concerning your meeting with
                        representatives of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Please note that
                        the double spaced note at Tab A remains the same. It is only the single
                        spaced “proposal”, the enclosure to the note, that is changed.</p>
                    <p>— At Tab II you will find a note to be handed to Group I. This substitutes
                        completely for the note which was attached to my separate memo of January
                        24, 1972 in the other package (envelope #1).</p>
                    <p>This envelope is marked #2 on the outside. The fatter envelope containing my
                        letter of January 24 and memo of January 24 has been marked #1 on the
                        outside.</p>

                    <p>Republic of Vietnam and United States Proposal for a Negotiated Settlement of
                        the Indochina Conflict</p>
                    <p>January 27, 1972</p>
                    <p>1. There will be a total withdrawal from South Vietnam of all U.S. forces and
                        other foreign forces allied with the government of South Vietnam within six
                        months of an agreement.</p>
                    <p>2. The release of all military men and innocent civilians captured throughout
                        Indochina will be carried out in parallel with the troop withdrawals
                        mentioned in point 1. Both sides will present a complete list of military
                        men and innocent civilians held throughout Indochina on the day the
                        agreement is signed. The release will begin on the same day as the troop
                        withdrawals and will be completed when they are completed.</p>
                    <p>3. The following principles will govern the political future of South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The political future of South Vietnam will be left for the South Vietnamese
                        people to decide for themselves, free from outside interference.</p>
                    <p>There will be a free and democratic Presidential election in South Vietnam
                        within six months of an agreement. This election will be organized and run
                        by an independent body representing all political forces in South Vietnam
                        which will assume its responsibilities on the date of the agreement. This
                        body will, among other responsibilities, determine the qualification of
                        candidates. All political forces in South Vietnam can participate in the
                        election and present candidates. There will be international supervision of
                        this election.</p>
                    <p>One month before the Presidential election takes place, the incumbent
                        President and Vice President of South Vietnam will resign. A caretaker
                        Administration, headed by the Chairman of the Senate, will assume
                        administrative responsibilities except for those pertaining to the election,
                        which will remain with the independent election body.</p>
                    <p>The United States, for its part, declares that it</p>
                    <p>— will support no candidate and will remain completely neutral in the
                        election.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d81-03" facs="d81-03"/>
                    <p>— will abide by the outcome of this election and any other political
                        processes shaped by the South Vietnamese people themselves.</p>
                    <p>— is prepared to define its military and economic assistance relationship
                        with any government that exists in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Both sides agree that:</p>
                    <p>— South Vietnam, together with the other countries of Indochina, should adopt
                        a foreign policy consistent with the military provisions of the 1954 Geneva
                        Accords.</p>
                    <p>— Reunification of Vietnam should be decided on the basis of discussions and
                        agreements between North and South Vietnam without constraint and annexation
                        from either party, and without foreign interference.</p>
                    <p>4. Both sides will respect the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina and those
                        of 1962 on Laos. There will be no foreign intervention in the Indochinese
                        countries and the Indochinese peoples will be left to settle their own
                        affairs by themselves.</p>
                    <p>5. The problems existing among the Indochinese countries will be settled by
                        the Indochinese parties on the basis of mutual respect for independence,
                        sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
                        affairs. Among the problems that will be settled is the implementation of
                        the principle that all armed forces of the countries of Indochina must
                        remain within their national frontiers.</p>
                    <p>6. There will be a general ceasefire throughout Indochina, to begin when the
                        agreement is signed. As part of the ceasefire, there will be no further
                        infiltration of outside forces into any of the countries of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>7. There will be international supervision of the military aspects of this
                        agreement including the ceasefire and its provisions, the release of
                        prisoners of war and innocent civilians, the withdrawal of outside forces
                        from Indochina, and the implementation of the principle that all armed
                        forces of the countries of Indochina must remain within their national
                        frontiers.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d81-04" facs="d81-04"/>
                    <p>8. There will be an international guarantee for the fundamental national
                        rights of the Indochinese peoples, the status of all the countries in
                        Indochina, and lasting peace in this region.</p>
                    <p>Both sides express their willingness to participate in an international
                        conference for this and other appropriate purposes.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD</p>
                    <p>Subject: 36th Meeting with the Chinese in Paris</p>
                    <p>On the evening of 26 January at 1930 I called as arranged two days before at
                        the Chinese Embassy Residence in Neuilly. I was met in the usual manner.
                        Only Tsao and Wei were present.</p>
                    <p>I then told them (reading from General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>'s letter) the various documents I was going to give
                        them. I then proceeded to do so.</p>
                    <p>They received the enclosures concerning the President's speech. (I read them
                        in both French and English. They like this system as then both Tsao and Wei
                        know what is there. There is no doubt, however, that Tsao is the higher in
                        the hierarchy.) They made no comment other than Tsao's mentioning he had
                        stayed up to hear it (0230 French time).</p>
                    <p>They seemed somewhat overwhelmed at the number of aircraft in Tab B. They
                        accepted Tab C (Procedures for notifying <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        of departure of aircraft from Guam). Tab D they also accepted without
                        comment as well as Tab E (The request for the medical corpsman and list of
                        equipment needed to support aircraft). The Proposed Plan for Communications
                        (Tab F) was also a source of some confusion to them. Terms such as
                        “satellite suitcase terminal” left them baffled. I tried to explain and they
                        seemed to get the general idea.</p>
                    <p>Tsao, however, asked what was the function of the two Western Union men. It
                        was not listed as was the specialization of everyone else. He also said that
                        they did not know the frequencies of the various aircraft. On what
                        frequencies should Shanghai call them while in flight. I said that I would
                        try and get the answers for him as soon as I could. He seemed slightly
                        overwhelmed at the mass of material and said more plaintively than
                        complaining, “It is already the 26th of January. I will have to send someone
                        to Peking. This is too much to send by telegram.”</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d82-02" facs="d82-02"/>
                    <p>They were as friendly and pleasant as always and seemed anxious to start
                        getting all this material off. So I did not stay and engage in the usual
                        small talk. As I was leaving, a group of Chinese arrived in a Volkswagen
                        minibus. Before they could see me, they were shoved around to the side
                        entrance by Wei. I then left.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:</p>
                    <p>37th Meeting with the Chinese in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Having been notified in Germany that the Chinese had a message and wished to
                        deliver it to me, I returned by commercial air from Germany. (This message
                        was given regarding my return to Paris by a prearranged code with my
                        secretary.)</p>
                    <p>On Sunday, January 30th, 1972. I went to the Chinese Embassy residence in
                        Neuilly and was received in accordance with the usual rites and priorities.
                        The Ambassador said that he appreciated my returning from Germany but he had
                        a communication of some consequence for me. After minor preliminaries washed
                        down with tea and preserved apples he ordered Tsao to give me the
                        communication and said that in order to save time they would not read it to
                        me. This was the first time that this was done and I am sure it was to avoid
                        the embarrassment of having to read something relatively unpleasant. I read
                        the communication which Tsao handed me and made a conscious effort to show
                        no emotion or reaction, folded it carefully and said that I would transmit
                        it at once. This was their rather harsh reply to our note concerning our
                        Vietnam Peace Plan which I transmitted to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> at 2245 that same day. Once this
                        was out of the way they were extremely cordial though there was clearly a
                        note of some embarrassment in the manner of all three including the normally
                        supremely poised and self confident Ambassador. They asked about my trip to
                        Germany, whether I was going to China, What the weather was like in the
                        United States at this time and other platitudes. I did not wish to prolong
                        the situation so after another cup of jasmine tea and two more preserved
                        apples, I took leave of them and was ushered out with more that usually
                        heart handshakes and back pats.</p>
                    <p>They did seem genuinely relieved when after giving me the harsh note they
                        were able to move to the more technical details of the forthcoming trip of
                        the advance party.</p>

                    <p>Subject: 39th Meeting with the Chinese in Paris. Feb 1, 1972</p>
                    <p>Having been notified late at night on January 31st, that a message was on its
                        way to Paris for delivery to the Chinese, I flew on the morning of February
                        1st from Wiesbaden to Paris by military aircraft. I stopped at the Embassy
                        and picked up the message which had been decoded by Miss Ouellette. I went
                        to the Chinese Embassy in Neuilly. I was received as usual and the
                        Ambassador said that he had not expected to see me so soon, that I was an
                        almost daily traveler from Germany. He was very cordial, after the
                        appropriate amount of small talk and chit chat I produced my message and
                        read it first in French and then in English. (They like it this way, then
                        Tsao can check on <persName>Wei</persName> and <persName>Wei</persName> can
                        check on Tsao.). The Ambassador nodded vigorously when I had finished and
                        said “that makes things much more clear”.</p>
                    <p>We then engaged in an appropriate amount of further small talk that was
                        characterized by much tea, unsalted peanuts and preserved apples and
                        apologies that they did not have something more suitable to offer me. We
                        talked of the super sonic Concorde and I gathered that the Chinese
                        enthusiasm for it had cooled somewhat. The Ambassador joked about James
                        Reston who had made a book out of his operation. We talked also about Sun
                        Tzu and his theories. He indicated that they were required reading in the
                        Peoples Army. Again all three Chinese could not have been more cordial and
                        friendly and this time the note of embarrassment which had marked our
                        previous meeting seemed to be absent. After an appropriate interval of
                        nonsense and persiflage, I left.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD</p>
                    <p>Subject: 41st Meeting with the Chinese in Paris, 11 February 1972</p>
                    <p>Shortly after my return from meeting that morning with the Chinese I received
                        a further message from Washington and called the Chinese for another
                        appointment. (This is done from a special phone and using a code name.) They
                        set 1600 that afternoon and at that time I again returned for the second
                        time that day to the Chinese Embassy in Neuilly.</p>
                    <p>Met at the gate by Tsao and Wei and ushered into the Red Room, a minute or
                        two later Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName> joined
                        us and after appropriate chit chat he produced a lavish cake and said that
                        it was the beginning of their New Year. We ate the cake and toasted the New
                        Year for our peoples and our leaders with rose flower wine. All of this made
                        me believe that they had something acrimonious to say and I was not wrong.
                        They then produced the message which reaffirmed their position not to
                        interfere in the Vietnamese War and repeating their support for the North
                        Vietnamese. I made a serious effort not to show any feeling as they read it
                        to me in English and then put it in my pocket (without, I hope, any change
                        in expression) and said that I would transmit it to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> at once. As soon as this was done
                        we discussed Chinese Calligraphy. I drew several characters. They criticized
                        them and showed me how to write them correctly. The Ambassador, trying to be
                        very nice, said that I had obvious aptitude and it would not take me more
                        than three years (!!!) to learn Chinese. All of them were obviously a little
                        embarrassed by the harshness of the tone of the note they had handed me.</p>
                    <p>I then gave them our message regarding further easing of trade restrictions
                        and our views on the Indian Subcontinent. These they accepted without
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>Tsao asked, as Press Attaché, if I knew the names of the newspapermen who
                        were going with the President's Party. I said that I did not. He commented
                        that though the numbers might seem small to us they were unprecedented as
                        far as the Chinese were concerned. They had never handled anything like this
                        number before. They asked me whether I was going with the President and I
                        said that I did not believe so or I would have heard by now. The Ambassador
                        said that he hoped <pb n="2" xml:id="d85-02" facs="d85-02"/>that at some
                        other time I would have the opportunity to go to his country. The Ambassador
                        asked whether I thought President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would be reelected and I said that I was sure he
                        would. The Ambassador said he thought so too as the American people approved
                        of his opening a dialogue with China. I replied, “That and many other things
                        too. “ He nodded agreement. After further cordial chit chat and much tea I
                        left.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>'s stature as one of the
                        20th century's outstanding political figures derives from a combination of
                        personal assertiveness, charismatic self-confidence, and a creative native
                        intelligence. This man knows where he wants China to go, and has been
                        pushing his country's social revolution for more than fifty years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s personality style combines
                        audacity and the activist impulse with a skillful sense of political
                        tactics: He has repeatedly shown a unique capacity to judge when to press,
                        when to retreat and adopt a humble posture, how to build a broad coalition
                        of support, and also an unflinching willingness to attack his opposition
                        when his own position is strong. As he expressed this political style to
                        Party leaders after surviving an attack on his policies in 1959:</p>
                    <p>“I shall not attack unless I am attacked; if I am attacked, I will certainly
                        counterattack; I counterattack only after I am attacked. Up to now I have
                        not given up this principle.</p>
                    <p>“I have now learned the art of listening. I always listen to others with
                        forbearance for one or two weeks before I hit back. I advise you comrades to
                        heed what others say. You may agree or disagree with me; that is your
                        business. If you disagree, I'll make a self-criticism if I am wrong.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s peasant background is evident in
                        his direct and earthy humor, which he often used to ridicule or disarm
                        opponents. As he observed to his comrades after the 1959 political battle:
                        “Now you'll all feel better after you break wind and empty your bowels.” As
                        well, however, he has the sensitivity to write appealing poetry, displays a
                        good working knowledge of Chinese history, and has a capacity for insight
                        and abstract social analysis which has produced a number of philosophical
                        writings and a clear (if not necessarily attainable) vision of his country's
                        future.</p>
                    <p>In your discussions with <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>, the Party
                        Chairman is likely to approach issues at a general, philosophical level
                        (leaving the details to <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>),
                        and in a style that will reflect the above-noted personal

                        interest to <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>, given his strong
                        expression of views on these matters. You are likely to find these views
                        expressed in a variety of ways in his discourse, or as themes which may
                        catch his interest.</p>

                        the United States might be characterized as follows: A once revolutionary
                        power has degenerated as “the people” have lost power to the “monopoly
                        capitalists.” The U.S. ruling circles have transformed America into an
                        imperialist country, but “the people” are now becoming politically conscious
                        of their plight, and a revolutionary trend in the U.S. is beginning to

                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s earliest view of the United
                        States was of a country that had successfully overthrown British colonial
                        rule in a “protracted war” (such as Mao was to lead against the Japanese).
                        In 1936, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Edgar</persName> Snow that he “had first heard of
                        America in an article which told of the American Revolution and contained a
                        sentence like this: 'After eight years of difficult war, Washington won
                        victory and built up his nation'.” <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        also claims to have been exposed to the views of <persName corresp="#p_LGA1">Lincoln</persName>, although some measure of the degree to which the
                        Chinese leaders view American history in Marxist terms may be gauged by
                        their interpretation that the American Civil War was fought by “capitalists”
                        because they wanted to ensure a free labor market for exploitation at low
                        wages. Had the slavery system been maintained, so this argument goes, the
                        northern capitalists would have been faced with a labor shortage, while
                        southern slave owners would have been at a competitive advantage because of
                        their free labor supply.</p>
                    <p>During the mid-1940s, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>—then the
                        leader of a small but disciplined Communist insurgency fighting the Japanese
                        in an uneasy “united front” with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>'s Nationalist Government—sought to gain American
                        material assistance for guerrilla operations (and to strengthen his position
                        against the Nationalists). When the U.S. rebuffed his overtures for
                        assistance, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s attitude turned
                        toward hostility.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has characterized the U.S. as an
                        “imperialist” power since the late 1940s, when it was clear that we would
                        continue to give exclusive support to <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>. In his view we interfered in the Chinese civil war
                        in 1948 when we transported <persName>Chiang</persName>'s troops from
                        Chungking to China's coastal cities, and gave the Nationalists weapons for
                        their life and death struggle with the Communist armies.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s most powerful statement
                        on the U.S. role in the Chinese revolution —revealing his capacity for
                        biting irony and polemical attack—was made in September 1949. As his armies
                        were sweeping to victory, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> turned
                        the knife on America's unsuccessful China policy by spurning Dean Acheson's
                        view that because of China's population pressures the Communist revolution
                        in China has an uncertain future:</p>
                    <p>“Do revolutions arise from overpopulation?… Were China's many revolutions in
                        the past few thousand years also due to overpopulation? Was the American
                        Revolution against Britain 174 years ago also due to overpopulation?
                        Acheson's knowledge of history is nil. He has not even read the American
                        Declaration of Independence. Washington, Jefferson and others made the
                        revolution against Britain because of British oppression and exploitation of
                        the Americans, and not because of any overpopulation in America.”(*)</p>

                        the newly formed People's Republic of China in the early 1950s, the
                        abandonment of the Truman/Acheson “let the dust settle” policy toward the
                        Communist revolution after the onset of the Korean War locked the U.S. into

                        In <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s view, America has denied him

                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s decision of late 1970 to extend
                        to you an invitation to visit Peking, and to seek through negotiations a
                        normalization of Sino-American relations, basically derives from a desire to
                        deal with China's own security problems (in the form of a Soviet military
                        threat, and Japan growing into an economic, political, and potentially
                        military power) and to resolve the Taiwan issue. Yet he and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> seem to feel that the current
                        situation in which the United States finds itself is favorable to a limited
                        Sino-American rapprochement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> have expressed the view that the U.S. has
                        learned the hard way that it cannot manipulate political affairs in Asia to
                        its own advantage. They look at the unsuccessful efforts of the Roosevelt
                        and Truman Administrations to prop up <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>'s Government in the 1940s, the military stalemate in
                        Korea, and the Vietnam quagmire, as events which have so soured the U.S. on
                        its active role in Asia that the political climate is now right for a
                        substantial American withdrawal from the region.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d86-05" facs="d86-05"/>
                    <p>Since the early 1960s the Chinese leaders have seen the possibility of
                        weakening the Western alliance system. Their establishment of diplomatic
                        relations with France in 1964 was designed to encourage trends to “national
                        independence” among America's allies. Similarly, as Marxists, the Chinese
                        probably assume that conflicts of economic interest between the U.S. and
                        Japan provide a line of cleavage that can be struck to divide opponent
                        states. By your visit the Chinese may seek to play on such trends.</p>
                    <p>In this same vein, the Chinese seem aware of American distrust of the Soviet
                        Union as a lever which can be used to convince us that we share a common
                        enemy. Undoubtedly their hope is that we can be persuaded that China
                        constitutes no threat to the U.S., as does the Soviet Union, and that we
                        will redeploy our forces from China's eastern flank to the Middle East and
                        Europe. In this way China will no longer face a two front threat, while
                        Russia will be confronted with a strengthened U.S. opponent on southern and
                        western frontiers. China will then be in an improved position to deploy her
                        limited nuclear forces against the Soviet threat on her northern border.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese, ever sensitive to areas of internal division within a country
                        (”contradictions,” in <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s parlance)
                        that may weaken an opponent's strength, are also paying close attention to
                        racial tensions in the U.S., and to the political ferment on American
                        campuses. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> told an American
                        student group that visited China in July 1971:</p>
                    <p>“In recent years Chairman Mao himself has paid attention to the American
                        situation and he has also asked us all to note the fact that it can be said
                        that the United States is now on the eve of a great storm. The question of
                        how this storm develops, however, is your task, not ours. We can only tell
                        you something of our hopes…</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> have indicated as well, however, that any anticipated
                        social revolution in American is a long-term prospect. They realize China's
                        immediate concerns can be dealt with most effectively through contacts with
                        your Administration. They are sensitive enough to the American political
                        scene to realize that your trip to China is likely to <pb n="6" xml:id="d86-06" facs="d86-06"/>be a positive benefit to your leadership.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> have both observed to foreign visitors that they see
                        your visit in relation to the 1972 Presidential campaign. They feel there is
                        popular pressure in the U.S. for an improvement in Sino-American relations,
                        and they see you motivated in part by a desire to respond to those pressures
                        in order to win re-election. By extending to you an invitation to visit
                        their country, they evidently view the prospect of your re-election as both
                        likely and favorable to their interests. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                            Tse-tung</persName> is reported to have remarked:</p>
                    <p>“Bad things can change into good things, and bad persons can become good
                        persons. I like a person such as <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, but I do not like Social Democrats or Revisionists.
                        These kinds of people say one thing and do another. Although <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has his cunning side, he is not as
                        bad as the others, for his policy is more open.”</p>
                    <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, viewing our country in Marxist terms, assume you
                        represent the “serious” and powerful economic interests which are the “real”
                        source of power in the United States. This being the case, you can speak
                        from a position of authority with directness. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Edgar</persName> Snow
                        that while you represent the “monopoly capitalists,” the problems in
                        Sino-American relations “would have to be solved with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.” Thus your visit is viewed as an
                        occasion for substantial and authoritative discussions, the building of a
                        longer term relationship with your Administration, and an opportunity to
                        directly exchange views on a wide range of issues. And, as noted, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> (and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>) enjoy a direct intellectual scrap.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. China in the International Arena</p>
                    <p>Over the past thirty years, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                            Tse-tung</persName> has shown considerable movement in his approach to
                        international affairs—with his constant concern being China's national
                        independence and security.</p>
                    <p>1944-45 Undercut American Support for the Nationalists, Balance the U.S. and
                        the Soviets</p>
                    <p>In the last days of the war against Japan, while the Communists were an
                        insurgent political movement outnumbered by <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s forces by 3:1, and where the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> had indications that Stalin would not
                        directly back them in a civil war, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        sought ways of undercutting the exclusive American support for the
                        Nationalists. He found sympathetic observers of his guerrilla armies in
                        American officers of the “Dixie Mission,” assigned to Yenan in the search
                        for more effective Chinese opposition to the Japanese. In January of 1945,
                        in the hope of gaining military assistance from the Roosevelt Administration
                        (and thus undercutting the American backing of <persName>Chiang
                            Kal-shek</persName>) <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> made a private offer
                        to General Wedemeyer to come to Washington in order to “interpret and
                        explain the situation in China” to the President. This overture was ignored
                        by American officials who wished to see a strong, united nationalistic China
                        emerge in Asia as a counterweight to Soviet and Japanese influence.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> seemed at that
                        time to be the leader most likely to create such a China.</p>
                    <p>1949, China Will 'Lean to One Side”</p>
                    <p>Despite Stalin's opposition to the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss>
                        promoting civil war, and the Russian treaty of 1945 with the Nationalist
                        government, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> pressed his military
                        operations against <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s
                        armies in 1947. Two years later, as the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss>
                        neared victory, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s concern was that
                        the U.S. might intervene in the last phase of the civil conflict, or that
                        Stalin might not support his leadership of a Communist Chinese state. For
                        these reasons, in July of 1949 <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        proclaimed that the new China would “lean to one side”; that is, that the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would join the “socialist camp.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> did not find that Stalin welcomed
                        this new addition to the Communist world with open arms, however. In
                        December of 1949, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> went to Moscow
                        to negotiate a new Sino-Soviet treaty. Years later the Chairman told Party
                        leaders of the struggle required to gain Stalin's support:</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d86-08" facs="d86-08"/>
                    <p>After the revolutionary victory, [Stalin] suspected that China would be like
                        Yugoslavia and that I would become a Tito. Then I went to Moscow to conclude
                        the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance [signed on February
                        14, 1950], but this involved a struggle. He [Stalin] did not want to sign
                        it, finally agreeing to do so after two months of negotiations. When did
                        Stalin begin to have confidence in us? It began in the winter of 1950-51,
                        during the Resist-America Aid-North Korea Campaign. He finally came to
                        believe that we were not Yugoslavia, and that I was not a Titoist.</p>
                    <p>1958-60 The Break with the Soviets</p>
                    <p>This commitment of China to the bipolar world struggle between Communism and
                        Capitalism was to last barely the decade of the 1950s. In 1956, Khrushchev's
                        attack on Stalin and the “cult of personality proved to be a political
                        embarrassment for <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> in China, where
                        certain leaders of the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> felt that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> himself was promoting a
                        “cult.” As well, Khrushchev's initiative was seen by <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> as a personal affront in that Khrushchev
                        did not inform him of the move ahead of time. Sino-Soviet tensions increased
                        further in the wake of the Hungarian and Polish uprisings triggered by
                        “de-Stalinization” as the Chinese sought to promote greater freedom for Bloc
                        countries within the “socialist camp,” to the anger of the Russians.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> was further embarrassed in 1956 to
                        find that Khrushchev began to promote a “peace” line—“peaceful coexistence,”
                        “peaceful competition, “peaceful transition to socialism”—which contradicted
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s policy prescriptions for
                        China. In the summer of 1958, in an effort to force the Soviets to stand up
                        for Chinese interests on the Taiwan issue, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> promoted the crisis over the offshore islands of Quemoy
                        and Matsu. This Chinese test of Khrushchev's “revolutionary commitment,” and
                        events which followed, led to a breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> recalled for Party leaders in
                        1962:</p>
                    <p>In the second half of 1958, Khrushchev attempted to block the China seacoast,
                        to launch a joint Sino-Soviet fleet to dominate the coastal area, and to
                        blockade us. Khrushchev came [secretly] to China because of this problem [in
                        late July 1958]. Thereafter, Khrushchev supported <persName corresp="#p_NJ3">Nehru</persName> in attacking us on the Sino-Indian border problem in
                        September 1959, and a statement to this effect was issued by Tass.
                        Khrushchev came <pb n="9" xml:id="d86-09" facs="d86-09"/>to China in October
                        [1959, just after his meetings with President Eisenhower at Camp David], to
                        attend the tenth anniversary of our national day, and he attacked us when
                        speaking at a dinner party. This was followed [by a series of international
                        Communist meetings] all of which concerned themselves with the dispute
                        between Marxism-Leninism and Revisionism. During 1960 we fought with
                        Khrushchev. You see, even between socialist nations and with
                        Marxism-Leninism, such a problem as this has arisen.</p>
                    <p>China's full break with the Russians came in the summer of 1960, when at the
                        height of the agricultural crisis created by the Great Leap Forward,
                        Khrushchev suddenly withdrew all Soviet technical assistance personnel and
                        aid programs from China. This was viewed by <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> as a great act of betrayal; it confirmed his view of
                        Khrushchev's “revisionism,” and compounded the Chinese economic crisis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s hatred of the Soviets remains as
                        a key factor (if not the key factor) in <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s thinking today, and extends as much or more to
                        Khrushchev's successors than to Khrushchev himself. It was, of course, under
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that “more than a million Soviet
                        troops” (a Chinese quote) have been massed on China's borders.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s response to Khrushchev's
                        betrayal of the Sino-Soviet relationship began in the early 1960s with
                        efforts to promote factional polemics within the International Communist
                        Movement to erode support for Soviet “revisionism.” This was combined with
                        attempts to encourage revolutionary struggles among “third world” countries
                        in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Neither of these approaches was very
                        successful from the Chinese perspective, although <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s vigorous attacks on Khrushchev's policies probably
                        contributed to the Soviet Premier's downfall in 1964, and prevented the
                        Soviets from convening a world meeting of Communist Parties to chastise the
                        Chinese for being “dogmatists.”</p>
                    <p>On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, when China withdrew from the world to
                        fight domestic battles, <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> media revealed
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s perception of the breakdown
                        of the bipolar world of the 1950s.</p>
                    <p>The characteristic of the present world situation is that… a process of great
                        upheaval, great division, and great reorganization is taking place. The
                        revolutionary movement of the <pb n="10" xml:id="d86-10" facs="d86-10"/>people of the world is surging forward vigorously….Drastic divisions and
                        realignments of political forces are taking place on a world scale.</p>
                    <p>It was only in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution that <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> found himself able to begin to cope with
                        this “process of great upheaval” and seek to shape the realignment of world
                        political forces in a manner suitable for China's interests. Since 1969,
                        there have been three major themes in China's approach to international
                        relations:</p>
                    <p>1. China will seek to be self-reliant. The slogan “regeneration through one's
                        own efforts,” is the new watchword of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s foreign policy, as well as a guideline for internal
                        affairs. (Note: this slogan was used by <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao
                            Tse-tung</persName> in the Yenan days.)</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviet Union is a “Social-Imperialist State.” In the wake of the
                        Sino-Soviet border clashes of 1969, the Chinese characterized the Russian
                        leadership as “the new Czars.” <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> is
                        seeking to construct a united front against the Soviets out of a combination
                        of disaffected Eastern European states, non-ruling Communist Parties hostile
                        to Moscow, and any non-Communist states who will join in opposition to
                        Russian power.</p>
                    <p>3. China will Speak for the Interests of the “Third World.” <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> now sees China's natural allies as the
                        colored and underdeveloped peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He
                        and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> proclaim that China
                        will never be a “super power,” bullying other states or interfering in their
                        internal affairs. In the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this fall, the
                        Chinese delegation sought to cultivate the smaller unaligned states; and
                        substantial efforts have been made to establish strong bilateral
                        relationships (through aid agreements, and political support) in such
                        countries as Ethiopia, Sudan, Zambia and Tanzania in Africa, and Peru and
                        Chile in Latin America.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d86-11" facs="d86-11"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and
                        Nuclear Weapons</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has taken an attitude toward
                        nuclear weapons that while they are indeed instruments of mass destruction,
                        fear of nuclear war should not paralyze the fighting will of the
                        “revolutionary forces.” He is sensitive to the psychological inhibitions on
                        nuclear powers which limit their willingness to use such weapons. As he once
                        said: “They [nuclear weapons] will not be used lightly.” He has taken a
                        posture of aggressive and self-righteous willingness to promote revolution
                        by means well under the nuclear threshold.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, beginning in 1958, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has pressed a program of atomic weapons development for
                        China. He seeks to attain a nuclear force which will deter any attack on
                        China proper, render the country immune from nuclear blackmail (which he
                        feels China suffered in Korea and in the Offshore Island crisis of 1958),
                        give pause to other major powers who would compromise China's international
                        interests, and inhibit non-nuclear powers from turning to the U.S. for
                        security under the American nuclear umbrella.” (Should such countries accept
                        American nuclear weapons on their territory, for example, they would then
                        themselves become potential targets of a retaliatory Chinese strike.)</p>
                    <p>In 1946, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> told Anna Louise Strong
                        that the atom bomb was a “paper tiger.” He said that while it was true that
                        the bomb was a weapon of “mass slaughter,” wars were decided by people, not
                        bombs, and that people with a revolutionary will would fight on despite
                        atomic weapons. In this same period he sought to buck up the fighting spirit
                        of his armies by pointing out that Japan had surrendered at the end of World
                        War II because the Soviet Union sent troops against her, not because the
                        U.S. had used two atomic bombs against Japanese cities. He criticized some
                            <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> comrades” for their fear of the
                        atomic bomb and their belief in the theory that “weapons decide everything.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s eventual victory over
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s armies—which
                        were armed with American weapons—convinced <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> that his “paper tiger” thesis was correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> further sought to convince China's
                        nuclear adversaries that because of his country's large population he did
                        not fear an atomic attack:</p>
                    <p>I had an argument about [nuclear war] with <persName corresp="#p_NJ3">Nehru</persName> [in 1954]. In this respect he is more pessimistic than
                        I am. I told him that if half of humanity is destroyed the other half will
                        still remain but imperialism will have been totally destroyed…</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d86-12" facs="d86-12"/>
                    <p>As late as 1965, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> further reiterated
                        the view that nuclear war would hardly mean the end of mankind. He observed
                        to <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Edgar</persName> Snow that “he had read
                        reports of an investigation by Americans who visited the Bikini Islands six
                        years after nuclear tests had been conducted there… They found mice
                        scampering about and fish swimming in the streams as usual… Probably there
                        had been two bad years after the tests [<persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> asserted], but nature had gone on. In the eyes of nature
                        and the birds, the mice and the trees, the atom bomb was a paper tiger.</p>
                    <p>Such an attitude, it would appear, was designed to convey the message that
                        China would not give up the revolutionary struggle because of a fear of
                        nuclear weapons. In fact, however, the Chinese appear to have backed away
                        from confrontations with the United States in Korea (in response to
                        President Eisenhower's hint that atomic weapons might be used) and in the
                        Taiwan Strait crisis of 1958, out of concern that atomic weapons might be
                        used against them.</p>
                    <p>It was very likely in response to this sense of nuclear inferiority that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>, in 1957, pressed the Soviets
                        for assistance in developing an independent nuclear capability. When
                        Khrushchev's partially positive response(*) indicated to <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> that the Soviets would use such
                        assistance to control rather than to aid China, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> pressed the Quernoy and Matsu confrontation of 1958 in
                        hopes of discrediting Khrushchev's policy of “peaceful coexistence.” When
                        the U.S. turned out to be more than a “paper tiger”—through its support for
                        the Nationalists, and despite the Soviet nuclear protection of
                            China—<persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> lost his calculated
                        gamble. Khrushchev, in fear of Chinese adventurism, unilaterally cancelled
                        the nuclear sharing agreement with China in June of 1959. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> continued to press for the development
                        of a Chinese nuclear weapons force, however. This effort first bore fruit
                        with an atomic test in October 1964—on the very day that Khrushchev was
                        ousted from power.</p>
                    <p>[footnote] (*) A Sino-Soviet nuclear sharing agreement was signed in October
                        1957. The Chinese later revealed, however, that they had asked the Russians
                        “for a sample atomic bomb and technical data on its manufacture,” but had
                        been rebuffed on such direct aid.</p>
                    <p>As China has developed her own nuclear weapons, official <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> statements have stressed four points:</p>
                    <p>1. China will never be the first to use such weapons. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials have challenged the Soviets and U.S. to make
                        similar “no first use” pledges.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d86-13" facs="d86-13"/>
                    <p>2. The existing nuclear powers have no right to a “nuclear monopoly,” and
                        China's weapons program is designed to break that monopoly for her own
                        defense and to create the circumstances in which negotiations might bring
                        about the “complete, thorough, total, and resolute prohibition and
                        destruction of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>3. The existing nuclear powers should dismantle their foreign bases, withdraw
                        all their troops and atomic weapons to their home territory, and “adopt
                        effective measures to prevent nuclear war.”</p>
                    <p>4. China will never agree to participate in nuclear disarmanent talks behind
                        the backs of the non-nuclear countries. On an issue of such importance, all
                        countries in the world, big or small, should have some say. China has a few
                        nuclear weapons, but she will never join the so-called club of nuclear
                        powers.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> believes that social progress
                        comes only through “struggle.” In a philosophical treatise of 1937 he wrote
                        that, “Changes in a society are due chiefly to the development of internal
                        contradictions [in that society].” <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        seems to relish a good fight, and has shown a creative politician's ability
                        to turn conflict situations to his advantage. In 1939 he wrote an essay
                        entitled “To Be Attacked By The Enemy Is A Good Thing, Not A Bad Thing.” He
                        turned this perspective to the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss>'s
                        ultimate survival during the war against Japan by creating a united front
                        against the foreign invader which prevented the Nationalists—over-burdened
                        with security problems—from dealing their Communist “allies” in the united
                        front a death blow.</p>
                    <p>Since coming to power, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has
                        manipulated “class struggle” in Chinese society, and policy conflict among
                            <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> leaders, so as to speed the
                        modernization of Chinese society. This has been evident in a series of
                        so-called “mass movements”—such as the Great Leap Forward of 1958-1960, and
                        the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1969—and also in <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s political in-fighting and purging of leaders who have
                        opposed his policies. As the Chairman observed in 1963: “The struggle
                        between the socialist and capitalist roads [of national development can
                        become a driving force for social change.” <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> rejects any abstract commitment to “peace” as a
                        political goal.</p>
                    <p>Complementing his stress on struggle, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has attacked the Confucian stress on social “harmony,”
                        which he believes kept China's peasants for centuries in a position of
                        exploitation by the elite Mandarin political class. One of the issues in the
                        Sino-Soviet dispute has been <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s
                        assertion that the “peaceful transition to socialism” through parliamentary
                        politics is unlikely, and hence that Communist Parties should not tie their
                        hands regarding the use of violent struggle as a means of achieving
                        power.</p>
                    <p>One of the most profound differences in Chinese and American views of
                        international affairs remains <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s
                        belief that China has both the “right” and the “duty” to assist
                        revolutionary movements in other countries in their struggles for power
                        through political and material aid. <pb n="15" xml:id="d86-15" facs="d86-15"/>While he asserts that China—unlike the U.S. and Soviets—will not send her
                        troops abroad, he does not accept Western notions of international relations
                        limited solely to state-to-state dealings. Through “people's diplomacy” and
                        contacts among Communist Parties, he seeks to encourage social change
                        through revolution even if it means subverting “bourgeois” governments with
                        which China has state relations. This view acquires greater urgency, of
                        course, when the Chinese feel that by supporting a subversive movement they
                        can exclude from a country Western or Soviet influence.</p>
                    <p>In regard to such “unfinished revolutions” as are embodied in divided Korea
                        or Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> is likely to take the
                        attitude that both China and the U. S. should keep “hands off” and let
                        events take the course that is “historically inevitable.” It is not known
                        how he might respond to suggestions that violence in these areas will tend
                        to pull in outside powers who see their interests threatened—thus enlarging
                        the conflict—or to the view that political violence is not the most
                        effective way to promote enduring social change.</p>

                        Race Issue</p>
                    <p>While the Chinese are sensitive to the political unacceptability of racist
                        attitudes (they publicly attack, for example, white racist governments in
                        Africa), they also sense that being a “colored” people they can use subtle
                        racial appeals to create a common cause with the poor underdeveloped
                        (colored) peoples of the world against the rich (white) Americans and
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>An example of such a subtle racist line is <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s 1963 appeal to the “workers, peasants, revolutionary
                        intellectuals, enlightened elements of the bourgeoisie and other enlightened
                        personages of all colors in the world—white, black, yellow, brown, and so
                        forth” to unite in opposition to racial discrimination in the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> sees the race problem in America as a
                        profound “contradiction” which can be stimulated to divide and weaken a
                        major adversary, perhaps creating the potential for a revolutionary
                        situation. His 1963 statement saw “a gigantic and vigorous nationwide
                        struggle” mounting throughout the U. S.—“and the struggle keeps mounting.”
                        Mao interpreted this conflict in Marxist terms:</p>
                    <p>The rapid development of the struggle of the American negroes is a
                        manifestation of the sharpening of class struggle… within the U. S.; it has
                        increasingly aroused the anxiety of the U.S. ruling circles.</p>
                    <p>Again, viewing the world in terms of China's revolution, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> felt that the “internal contradictions”
                        in American society provided a point of cleavage which could be stimulated
                        to divide and weaken China's (then) major opponent.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Accent on Youth</p>
                    <p>Reflecting <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s own early years as a
                        rebellious student, the Chairman sees youth as playing an important role in
                        social change. Young people are assertive, audacious, and uncommitted to the
                        status quo. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has also expressed
                        concern, however, that China's younger generation might not carry on the
                        struggle for China's modernization because they are growing up in a peaceful
                        society. As this was expressed in 1963:</p>
                    <p>… the question of cultivating successors [to lead China's revolution] has
                        become increasingly urgent and important. Internationally, imperialism
                        headed by the United States has placed its hope of realizing “peaceful
                        evolution” in China on the corruption of our third and fourth generations.
                        Who can say that this way of thinking of theirs is not without a certain
                        foundation?</p>
                    <p>In 1965 Mao told Andre Malraux that China's youth “has to be put to the test”
                        in order to develop their revolutionary commitment. During the Cultural
                        Revolution of 1966-1969 the Chairman sought to “steel” China's younger
                        generation in struggle by organizing them as Red Guards to attack his
                        opponents in the Party leadership.</p>
                    <p>These views shape <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s perception of
                        social change in the world beyond China. He and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> have obviously interpreted the current student
                        political unrest in the United States as holding the same potential for
                        revolution which they knew in their youth. As <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> observed to an American student group that
                        visited China in July of 1971:</p>
                    <p>In our country you would be considered high intellectuals, and you have a
                        heavy responsibility. It is your responsibility to link general truth with
                        actual practice… Some of you have said that foreign experience cannot be
                        mechanically brought over to your country. That is right. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> tells us that one must rely on his own
                        efforts. We cannot impose on you; neither can you just mechanically copy
                        from us. [But] you can see that <pb n="18" xml:id="d86-18" facs="d86-18"/>America's youth is gradually raising their political consciousness.
                        According to our experience, it is always intellectuals who start [a
                        revolution] because it is easier for them to accept revolutionary theory and
                        revolutionary experience from books. But for the movement to succeed, you
                        must go among the workers…</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Personal Distrust of Intellectuals </p>
                    <p>Despite <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s accent on youth and the
                        fact that, as noted above, university students are regarded as high
                        intellectuals in China, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> carries a
                        deep personal distrust of intellectuals. As a university student in Peking
                        just “up from the provinces” in 1918, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> was ridiculed by the big-city intellectuals for his
                        heavy rural accent and his status as a librarian's assistant. The sense of
                        personal humiliation he drew from this experience found expression in the
                        1940s when he criticized intellectuals who came to Yenan to aid in the war
                        against Japan for their arrogance and aloofness from peasants and
                        workers.</p>
                    <p>In addition, China's intellectual traditionally have applied themselves well
                        to their studies, but have lagged in practical work, disdaining to dirty
                        their hands and looking down on those who engage in physical labor.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has great contempt for such
                        attitudes.</p>
                    <p>After coming to power, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> was faced
                        with the problem of at once needing the intellectuals for their technical
                        skills in the process of modernizing China, yet fearing that their
                        “bourgeois” and “antisocialist” attitudes would make them unreliable
                        allies—or worse that they would dilute the revolutionary enthusiasm of Party
                        members with whom they worked. To deal with this problem, in 1956-1957
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> launched a campaign to “let a
                        hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend.” This was
                        an effort to encourage intellectuals to lend their creativity to China's
                        development, and to criticize bureaucratic behavior on the part of Party and
                        state functionaries, yet to be subject themselves to criticism for their
                        “backward” thinking and behavior. This approach backfired on <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> in May of 1957 when China's
                        intellectuals, many of whom had been educated in the West, criticized the
                        very basis of Communist Party rule in China. Mao was forced to call a halt
                        to the mutual-criticism campaign.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d86-19" facs="d86-19"/>
                    <p>In the early 1960s, however, intellectuals again became critical of Communist
                        Party rule in the context of the agricultural crisis created by the Great
                        Leap Forward. Some even published indirect criticisms of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> himself, comparing him to Stalin(*) or
                        characterizing him as a mental case. Stung by their ridicule, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> initiated the Cultural Revolution in
                        late 1965 by attacking a playright who had compared him to a dictatorial
                        emperor of old; and in the summer of 1966 the Chairman manifested his
                        complete disgust with intellectual life in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> by closing down China's university system and having the
                        professors subject to mass criticism by their Red Guard students.</p>
                    <p>[footnote] (*) It should be noted that <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> continues to pay respect to Stalin as a great national
                        leader and revolutionary. He has said that despite the “30%” of Stalin's
                        deeds which were in error, the 70% of things he did which were good for the
                        revolution in Russia deserve recognition and honor</p>
                    <p>At present intellectual life in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is
                        just beginning to recover from the Cultural Revolution discipline of mass
                        rote memorization of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s “little red
                        book.” Universities are beginning to reopen, yet students and teachers are
                        still required to spend months or years on farms or in factories reforming
                        their elitist and “anti-socialist” attitudes through physical labor. We do
                        not know whether <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has found a way
                        to deal with the paradox of needing the intellectuals to develop China, yet
                        controlling their attitudes of elitism, aloofness from physical labor, and
                        bureaucratic tendencies (see below) which have for so long been a part of
                        China's Mandarin heritage.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VIII. Man in a Bureaucratic Society</p>
                    <p>In contrast to many other Communists, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has doubts about the virtue of a Party and governmental
                        bureaucracy as instruments of national development. His provincial peasant
                        background has given him a deep distrust of the Mandarin class, and its
                        traditional role as a bureaucratic administrative elite. As early as 1955
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> complained to other Party
                        leaders of the way in which the <gloss target="#t_CCP1">CCP</gloss> was
                        building a bureaucratic machine that was strangling local initiative:</p>
                    <p>Now there are dozens of hands interfering with local administration, making
                        things difficult for the regions. Although neither the [Party] Center nor
                        the State Council knows anything about it, the departments <pb n="20" xml:id="d86-20" facs="d86-20"/>[of the Central Government] issue orders
                        to the provincial and municipal governments… Forms and reports are like
                        floods. This situation must change, and we must find a way to deal with
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> initially tried to decentralize
                        the government system during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1960) by creating
                        self-sufficient “people's communes' and organizing the population into
                        “guerrilla warfare"-style semi-autonomous units structured along military
                        lines. When this movement ran into deep trouble in the early 1960s, leaders
                        of the Party and state resisted <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s
                        policies. In the Cultural Revolution <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> finally decided to pull apart these bureaucracies which
                        were thwarting his efforts to decentralize administration.</p>
                    <p>This enduring effort of the Chairman is based on a view that bureaucracy
                        thwarts popular initiative, making people passive and dependent on guidance
                        from organizational superiors. His own activist and “struggle” approach to
                        life makes him convinced that if China's people are only given greater
                        opportunity to take initiative, a tremendous creative force of 800,000,000
                        people will be released to modernize Chinese society.</p>
                    <p>For all of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s almost romantic
                        beliefs in the creative energies of his people, however, he exhibits a basic
                        distrust of genuine popular political initiative. While he has repeatedly
                        encouraged “mass campaigns” such as the Cultural Revolution in which people
                        are directed to criticize Party bureaucrats, these are consciously
                        structured and manipulated affairs organized by Mao at the political
                        “center.”</p>
                    <p>In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has indicated that
                        he feels China has something to learn from the U.S. in developing a
                        decentralized and relatively unbureaucratic system of government. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAE1">Edgar</persName> Snow paraphrased Mao in
                        late 1970:</p>
                    <p>Chairman Mao said that China should learn from the way that America
                        developed, by decentralizing and spreading responsibility and 'wealth among
                        the 50 states. A central government could not do everything. China must
                        depend on regional and local initiatives. It would not do to leave
                        everything up to him [<persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>].</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IX. Distrust of Peasant Initiative</p>
                    <p>Part of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s unwillingness to tolerate
                        genuine mass initiative seems to be based on the fact that China's “masses”
                        are largely peasants with minimal education, potentially conservative
                        attitudes, local economic interests, and parochial family social ties. As a
                        Marxist he sees the working class as the only group really committed to
                        industrialization; and as a Chinese he understands that the peasants have a
                        “spontaneous tendency toward capitalism” characteristic of small
                        producers.</p>
                    <p>A further reason for <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s distrust of
                        peasant initiative is his fear that they are vulnerable to manipulation by
                        intellectuals and bureaucrats. Being of peasant background himself,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> is aware of the rural
                        population's traditional sense of inferiority before men of literacy, given
                        the age-old prestige of the Confucian scholar-official in Chinese
                        society.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">X. Collective Life Versus Individualism</p>
                    <p>Like most Chinese, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> equates
                        “individualism with “selfishness.” One of the more distorted American
                        interpretations of Chinese culture with a Western bias has been the view of
                        the Chinese as rugged individualists. As late as 1949, even an American
                        Secretary of State (Dean Acheson, in the White Paper on China), looked
                        forward to a time when the Chinese people, only recently come under
                        Communist control, would reassert their “democratic individualism.” In fact,
                        group life—whether it be that of the family, school class, or clan—has
                        always predominated over individual liberty.</p>
                    <p>In <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s China, group pressures are
                        constantly brought to bear on the individual through
                        “criticism—self-criticism” meetings and political study groups. This
                        situation is further manifest in a downplaying of competition between
                        individuals (as in sporting events) which is seen as fostering
                        “individualism, “ and a disdain of material incentives for labor, which is
                        denounced as promoting selfishness and personal greed.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d86-22" facs="d86-22"/>
                    <p>At the same time, however, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> lays
                        great stress on “self-reliance” and individual effort. His vision of China
                        is of a country organized into self-sufficient rural communes where a strong
                        collective spirit will encourage each individual to give his all for the
                        progress of the group—and thus himself. But <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> does not see individual achievement as worthy apart from
                        group collective purposes.</p>
                    <p>Thus, you are unlikely to find <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        responsive to assertions of the virtue of such Western economic concepts as
                        wage incentives and the competition of the marketplace as methods to
                        promoting economic development. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> has attacked the Yugoslavs and Soviets for “restoring
                        capitalism” in their countries by resorting to market competition and wage
                        incentives.</p>
                    <p>(It remains a fact, however, that a great many Chinese today would fall into
                        the category of “selfishness” decried by <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>. In places such as Hong Kong, for example, where the
                        rigid social organization of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s
                        China is not present, there is a constant scramble by individual Chinese for
                        financial advantage. This is often at the expense of other Chinese. To be
                        sure, those engaged in the scramble may be seeking benefits for their
                        families rather than individual advantage, but the net effect is the same.
                        The phenomenon exists even in <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s
                        China, as demonstrated by references to the “spontaneous tendency toward
                        capitalism” of the peasantry, and the self-seeking struggles for power of
                        the Red Guards.)</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD</p>
                    <p>Subject: 43rd Meeting with the Chinese in Paris, 17 February 1972, 1800</p>
                    <p>I went to the Chinese Embassy in Neuilly at the appointed time and was
                        greeted as usual by Tsao and Wei. The Ambassador was not present and they
                        apologized for this. I brought them a large box of candy as a New Year
                        present and they were pleased.</p>
                    <p>Tsao said that the President was on his way to China and there was much
                        coverage in the press. He was disappointed that I did not go. I said that I
                        shared his disappointment, perhaps to a greater degree. But I hoped to visit
                        China, maybe after I retired. He said that I would always be welcome as I
                        had been a “shadow Ambassador”. He mentioned that he was 51 and Wei said he
                        was 31 and they would greet me whenever I came.</p>
                    <p>Tsao then said that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        had been attacked on both sides for his decision to open the dialogue with
                        China. On the right by “Fascist militarist” elements and on the left by
                        pro-Soviet intellectuals and so-called leftists who were really not leftists
                        at all. I replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was
                        a man who had been much attacked but was not swayed by such attacks from
                        doing what he thought was right. If he was attacked by extremists it was not
                        to our or their advantage.</p>
                    <p>Tsao then asked whether our relations with West Germany were not better this
                        year than last year, especially since the meeting between the President and
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>. I said that as far
                        as I knew our relations with the Federal Republic were good both last year
                        and this year. This did not mean that we agreed on every single question,
                        but we accepted that our friends might not always agree with us. Personally,
                        I felt we were not hostile to better relations in Europe. We just did not
                        want the Soviets to take over Europe. If they did, it would be bad for us
                        and bad for the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Wei then said he had seen on French television the night before “30 Seconds
                        Over Tokyo” and said that we were allies at that time. He asked whether I
                        did not fear a resurrection of Japanese militarism. I said I personally did
                        not for two reasons: First, the Japanese had discovered that they could
                        achieve far more prosperity from work than <pb n="2" xml:id="d87-02" facs="d87-02"/>from war and secondly, a new generation had grown up that
                        was quite different from the old Samurai spirit. Young Japanese wanted cars,
                        travel, vacations—not territorial expansion. Surprisingly, they both
                        nodded.</p>
                    <p>I then judged we had had sufficient small talk and read our message replying
                        to their somewhat harsh reactions on Vietnam. Tsao smiled and said, “Perhaps
                        you think we got too excited.” I smiled and said, “Perhaps.” He promised to
                        transmit it at once and with many “Happy New Years” I left.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister could I
                        settle the matter of the press with the Chairman?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have just drafted
                        something.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What I would like to do,
                        if you agree, Mr. Prime Minister,—our press is wondering why the Plenary
                        Session was delayed and were thinking maybe it was because you and the
                        President had started quarreling in the car (laughter). So, what we would
                        like … (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> asked Jack Reedy to sit
                        on the sofa) … we would like to say reasonably soon that there was a meeting
                        and that that's why the Plenary Session was delayed; perhaps before the
                        Plenary Session begins. Concerning the pictures, could we make sure our
                        press gets the pictures?</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d89-02" facs="d89-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will give the pictures first
                        to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our public relations
                        people are going to be charmed by you.</p>
                    <p>I want to discuss the agenda. We have a complicated system of government. I
                        want to tell you who knows what among our group. Nobody from the State
                        Department knows that there is a draft of the Communique except for the two
                        paragraphs on Taiwan which we have shown to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. But nobody has seen anything else.
                        We did that so that we could say it was discussed by the President and the
                        Chairman and you.</p>
                    <p>No one else knows the five assurances I have given you on Taiwan. But the
                        President will repeat them to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The President will repeat them
                        in the private discussions or in the Plenary?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the private
                        discussions, and after we come back to America we will inform the
                        bureaucracy of it.</p>
                    <p>No one knows what we have discussed—how much we cooperated during the
                        India/Pakistan situation, or you would have read it in the newspaper.</p>
                    <p>And no one knows how much we have told you about our relations with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>No one knows about my trips to New York City to talk with your Ambassador.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> knows that our
                        contact point is Paris, but he does not know of any of the messages that
                        have come back and forth.</p>
                    <p>I say this so that by inadvertence your people do not say anything in the
                        private meetings with the State Department that will be a surprise to them.
                        After the election in November we plan to bring the two bureaucracies into
                        closer harmony. But it would be foolish to do it now and have them leak to
                        the press. And you may have noticed what they did to me.</p>
                    <p>Now in our discussions, Mr. Prime Minister, I recommend—the President
                        recommends that we proceed as we did in October. At the Plenary Session the
                        President will make a fairly general statement, a very general statement,
                        and he will list some topics and he will then propose that we break up into
                        private groups.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d89-03" facs="d89-03"/>
                    <p>We recommend that the Foreign Minister discuss first the issues of exchanges,
                        diplomatic contacts and trade in these private meetings while you talk to
                        the President about whatever you decided to discuss, including Taiwan. When
                        they are finished with this, we recommend the Foreign Minister discuss
                        Taiwan—not the Communique so much, but the subject, because we want quite
                        frankly that the archives of our State Department have your position.</p>
                    <p>The American folklore has said that the Chinese are complicated and we are
                        simple, but when I hear myself talk I think we are complicated and you are
                        much easier. We should schedule the meetings of the Foreign Minister and our
                        staffs for the same time that you meet with the President so that both
                        parties are occupied. And after these issues are discussed we can then
                        decide—the President and you—what other subjects should be given to the
                        Foreign Minister. This is, of course, subject to your approval.</p>
                    <p>If you would in the Plenary Session suggest that perhaps they should begin
                        discussing all these issues we will agree, and we have already told the
                        Secretary of State that we will do this so there would be no difficulty and
                        embarrassment.</p>
                    <p>The second problem we have is that of the Joint Communique. We have to work
                        out a schedule of how to complete it. I am responsible for it on our side,
                        and the President wants to be involved only if a very great issue of
                        principle arises. As I understand it there are the following issues we still
                        have to discuss. We have to change the language on South Asia because it is
                        now no longer relevant. We told you we would bring some new language on
                        exchanges and trade, and we have brought that. We have to have some more
                        discussion on Taiwan, not that we want to change our agreement on what I
                        told you privately but on the issue of how we can present something
                        publicly. General Haig already told you that. He left some language with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> brought back our replies.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You said you would
                        consider it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We said we did not agree with
                        the wording brought by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. We still have our wording, but we said that we would
                        consider the matter.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d89-04" facs="d89-04"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's exactly right. We
                        don't think you agreed to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>'s wording. We recognize we need more discussions and
                        need to approach it in a more constructive spirit. But we have to set some
                        time when we can do it, and therefore I have raised it as one of the agenda
                        items.</p>
                    <p>I have brought with me two items I want to discuss with you. One, I have a
                        list of all the negotiations we are conducting with the Soviet Union of
                        which we simply want to inform you, or whomever you designate, so that you
                        know of them for the purpose of the Moscow trip so that no misunderstanding
                        will arise between us. This is no request for reciprocity. And secondly, we
                        are prepared if you wish, and I have the information here, to give you on a
                        very restricted basis some information on dangers we both confront in the
                        military field in order that we both will understand any situations like the
                        India/Pakistan situation if it should arise again.</p>
                    <p>Both of these items will take time and I mention it only so we can schedule
                        it properly.</p>
                    <p>The only other item I have—and I have already mentioned it to the Vice
                        Minister—usually we have somebody in the car with the President when he
                        travels with somebody like yourself. In this case we would require only an
                        interpreter. If you would be good enough to give me your notes so we will
                        know what the President discussed. If we can also in the meetings with you
                        and with the Chairman, we will not use our interpreters but will rely on
                        your interpreters. We will tell the press that we have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> there to check on your
                        interpreter, and I apologize to your interpreter. It is only so our people
                        won't say we put ourselves at your mercy—which we are doing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No question about that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One final point. We have
                        exchanged some notes on Vietnam and this is not the time to discuss the
                        circumstances, but I want the Prime Minister to know we are aware of the
                        criticism to which the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is exposed. You
                        can be sure we never send a communication to you without sending a similar
                        one or identical one to your northern neighbor. If I can tell the Prime
                        Minister informally, they have replied somewhat more gently to us lately
                        than the Prime Minister (laughter).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So after the Plenary Session we
                        will be divided into two groups. Would it not be better for the Foreign
                        Minister and the Secretary of State <pb n="5" xml:id="d89-05" facs="d89-05"/>to start discussing the overall international situation, and how to
                        promote Sino-American relations, and how to get relaxation of tensions in
                        the Far East, and to have that as a start and then to go on into specific
                        matters? If we went into specific matters first it appears rather
                        sudden.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would prefer, Mr. Prime
                        Minister, if you agree, if we could first have the general discussion with
                        the President so that we could instruct our Secretary on the basis of these
                        discussions, and this is why we took the liberty of suggesting first to
                        discuss concrete issues. Logically you are correct, but bureaucratically it
                        would be easier for us the other way. But the President is prepared to
                        discuss normalization issues first, and then when he has discussed it with
                        you, we can instruct the Secretary of State to discuss it with the Foreign
                        Minister on the third day.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That means it is alright for the
                        discussion by the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister to be held one day
                        after the meeting with the Prime Minister and you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would prefer if they
                        could talk tomorrow about these concrete issues and then the next day they
                        can talk about the normalization issue. We will not release to the press
                        what the subjects are so there will be no embarrassment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When you say you won't release
                        anything to the press, you mean on the talks with the Secretary of State and
                        the Foreign Minister?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That would be better.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All we will say is that
                        they met for three or two hours. Our proposal is to tell the press at the
                        end of each day that we met for X number of hours and give them no
                        topic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The Plenary Session this
                        afternoon cannot be too long.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the Prime Minister
                        agrees, when he and the President meet, they can start with normalization
                        issue and then go on to another issue. Then the Foreign Minister and the
                        Secretary of State can take it up the next day. We will not say anything to
                        the press.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d89-06" facs="d89-06"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Another way is if your President
                        is not going to go on a sightseeing tour tomorrow morning we can have the
                        Secretary of State and other officials of the State Department go on a
                        sightseeing tour tomorrow morning, and the Secretary of State and the
                        Foreign Minister can have discussions tomorrow afternoon. And then would it
                        be possible for us to have discussions with your President both tomorrow
                        morning and afternoon. When I say morning, I mean after 10:00.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to check because he
                        had planned to do governmental work on Washington tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In that case we can also have
                        the discussion in the afternoon only, and then have it held for a longer
                        period of time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's alright.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Then as for the drafting of the
                        Joint Communique, our side will be <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Ch'iao
                            Kuan-hua</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang
                            Wen-chin</persName>. And I still have to accompany the President on the
                        other meetings.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then I will work out with
                        them when we should meet. I can meet with them tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, both of them can meet with
                        you tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Just so he will treat me
                        better than he treats Mr. <persName>Malik</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I cannot guarantee that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then I nominate Mr.

                        —</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We can consider that after
                        tomorrow, because your President will be still working on his Washington
                        business. You can discuss it with Mr. Ch'iao. He will not speak to you like
                        he speaks to Mr. <persName>Malik</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will remind him of
                        that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then I heard your President
                        planned to sign some Labor Act. We don't know the content—we don't know
                        whether we need take part in it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> No, it is domestic.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You wanted to send a fountain
                        pen to us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will send you a
                        fountain pen from another time. This has nothing to do with you. It is a
                        Labor Act—this is something that has to be done at a certain time, and you
                        are not to be involved in any way in any publicity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Otherwise we will be interfering
                        in your internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We had already cancelled
                        sending the pen. The signing has to take place—or do you object?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We don't care at all. You may
                        use the Guest House.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will sign it in your
                        Guest House.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There will be only American
                        correspondents that will cover it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. And we will make it
                        perfectly clear. Quite frankly, it is the only piece of legislation we have
                        at this moment, and it was important for the President to show that the
                        Government could be functioning even when he was away. It is also a way to
                        show the citizens that he was running the Government when he was away. We
                        will not involve you in any way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And then on the question of the
                        South Asian subcontinent and the part relevant to our Joint Communique—what
                        do you know? We will be most grateful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As I told you in the
                        message I sent to you, the President will also want to discuss it with you
                        because we have the problem of recognition of Bangladesh, and the problem of
                        future relations with India, and we want to do it in a parallel direction
                        with you—separately but parallel.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And we would like to know your

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will discuss it with Mr.

                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have it. If you don't plan to

                        practice to include in these the names of our working people because if
                        there was no interpreter it would be impossible to do this work.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it is better not
                        to list Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> for reasons which are
                        too complex.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Okay. But you would report this
                        to the President that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> will

                        Do you mind if in our release we just said the President because in

                        because he is convalescing. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> told you and the President that he had a problem with

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem is not having
                        been present. They will be very anxious if they don't get one picture with
                        the President. I mean if we can say there will be another meeting in which
                        they can get their picture it will ease our position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But if we cannot guarantee that
                        and it cannot take place…. But at the same time it will not be good to tell
                        them the Chairman has suffered from bronchitis.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I did not know we were
                        going to see the Chairman today. I was going to raise this problem with you.
                        It is not right for the President to wait until he is summoned to see the
                        Chairman. This is not in conformity with the dignity of the President, and
                        therefore if we say we don't know, they will say why don't we know? I am
                        just telling you what the press will ask us. How should we answer them?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Well maybe you can say that the
                        next meeting has not yet been determined.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That would be fine.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As for our press release, why
                        don't we have it translated and give you a copy of it and also the
                        pictures?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we use the text you
                        gave us? I will, have the secretary read it back to you. (Secretary reads
                        text.) Do you mind if we say at his residence?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, you may say Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s residence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can say the President
                        met with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> this
                        afternoon at his residence. And say they had a serious and frank
                        discussion.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When do you think it is better
                        to release it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be best to
                        release it as quickly as possible to explain why the Plenary Session was
                        delayed. And then we will release the pictures as soon as we have them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Anyway, the pictures will not be
                        published before you publish them. The newsreel will not be published before
                        you publish it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May Mrs. Gwyer type it?
                        Should we say decisions were taken by majority vote?</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Here is a letter from
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> to the Prime
                        Minister. </p>
                    <p>How should we proceed, Mr. Vice Foreign Minister? </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: If it is not lacking in courtesy, our idea is to first hear your
                        ideas and suggestions. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I suggest that we do
                        the following? We are discussing the Communique now. May I suggest that we
                        go through it page by page to see whether there is any part of it that
                        either side wants to change, and then we can go back to those parts. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Well there are actually two ways to go about it. One way would be to
                        first bring out those principal questions, that is to say some parts of the
                        Communique already have been changed—for instance the question of the South
                        Asian subcontinent, and then there is the question <pb n="2" xml:id="d90-02" facs="d90-02"/>of the crucial question which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> talked with the Prime Minister
                        about yesterday and you can offer us your thinking on that. And then the
                        other way is as you suggested, the methodical way from the beginning to the
                        end. We want to hear your views on that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have a number of which
                        may be minor suggestions as we go through it, and then we have, I think, the
                        major question of South Asia, simply because it is now outdated, but I think
                        we will agree that it will not take us long. What you call the crucial
                        question is very difficult. My deputy General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> had told the Prime Minister that we would come with
                        some additional suggestions on exchanges and trade which we could also use,
                        which I don't think are questions of principle but more a form of
                        expression. We have a few editorial suggestions for changing the word
                        “would” to “will” in a few places—for instance where we say commitments
                        “would be honored” we would like to say “will be honored.” It is purely
                        grammatical, and I don't think it makes any difference. And we have one
                        suggestion how to underline—as I understand this Communique—we are saying
                        that People's Republic and the U.S. will not resort to the use or threat of
                        force with each other. This is in the Communique now, and we have one
                        suggestion for your consideration of how we could emphasize this a little
                        more, but that is again not an issue of principle.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We agree to your suggested procedure, that is we can go through the
                        entire Communique page by page, and this is only a preliminary review,
                        because the talks between the leaders have not started, and these are
                        matters which can be agreed to.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We should talk about
                        Taiwan today, too. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Our side may also have some ideas and some changes, and some of them
                        may be minor suggestions. We will mention them later. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me give you our
                        suggestions. Would you like a copy so that you have the same page number
                        that we have? This should be the same text as yours, but I can never
                        guarantee the typing.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: It does not matter, if there is an error on our part.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't have to bother
                        with the first page. Then on the second page of this we would like to
                        suggest—this is a purely rhetorical device—to substitute for the first
                        paragraph a sentence from the last paragraph of the Communique—this
                        paragraph in English is not very strong—to say “the two sides were gratified
                        to have this opportunity after <pb n="3" xml:id="d90-03" facs="d90-03"/>so
                        many years without contact to present their points of view.”</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Then on “variety of issues” … You prefer to leave it out.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you want to keep that
                        paragraph, this is not a big issue. It is just to begin the Communique with
                        a slightly stronger sentence. “During our talks”—this sentence can be either
                        kept or dropped. We prefer to leave it out but only for the English. If it
                        means a lot to you we can keep it in. Maybe if we dropped “during their
                        talks …” </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: After that “the leaders of China and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>”—we will consider it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is only to begin it
                        with a stronger sentence.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: I approve of that. From our side we think it is better to maintain
                        these words—“important changes taking place.” </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can tighten up the
                        sentence a little bit. We can just say “expounded their respective views”
                        but “views” and “positions” in English just repeats itself.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Would you kindly prepare a text as a preliminary exchange?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then no comments on the
                        rest except you will want to change the last three lines on page 3 about
                        India/Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We plan to bring it up to date. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No change in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: On the question of South Asia—on the Chinese side, in addition to the
                        necessary change in South Asia, we have some minor changes on some other
                        parts of our statement—not substantive.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We may do this, too, but I
                        won't discuss it now. On the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side, on
                        pages 3 and 4 of the text you have that I gave you, the only change we made
                        is to put everything in the past tense and conditional into the present
                        tense—on page 4 put everything in the present tense. For instance
                        “envisages” rather than “envisaged.” </p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d90-04" facs="d90-04"/>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Where it says “would be honored”—“will be honored.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. It means the same
                        thing. The reason that we had “would” was because it referred back to
                        “stated, “and it is the correct English, but the word “stated” is four lines
                        back and people forget. It changes no meaning. If my assistant had been from
                        Harvard rather than Yale it would have been right the first time. You don't
                        know what I have to put up with, Mr. Vice Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: If you bully him like that, I will have objections about you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The only way I keep my
                        staff is that they hope they will be around when I collapse. They have
                        invested so much time in being bullied now that they have to be present when
                        I have a breakdown (laughter).</p>
                    <p>No other change on page 4 of our text except on South Asia. One page 5 we
                        have a suggestion on how we could emphasize this point of renouncing force,
                        and we would put it in the middle here. The underlined part is new. It
                        really repeats what we are saying on top of the page. It really repeats
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We will consider that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Taiwan section we will
                        discuss, so I will skip this. On the next paragraph, alter the Taiwan
                        section, we promised we would bring you some language which we would like to
                        submit. This is just for discussion. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: On this matter we will further discuss it and study it. It is a
                        question of wording, and at the same time involves matters of substance.
                        Normalization should be handled on the basis of normalization of state
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's the issue that the
                        Prime Minister and the President discussed yesterday which should come
                        first. Perhaps we should not use the word “normalization” at all here. Let
                        me suggest, in order not to have that word an issue, let us leave it
                        out.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We will study that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are here now just
                        discussing it—you usually come back with a better draft than we do.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: You have praised us on so many occasions, you have overpraised us. It
                        is a pity that there are no Yale graduates. I put the issue in a very simple
                        way, but my colleagues put it in a very complicated way.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d90-05" facs="d90-05"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: He must have gone to Harvard
                        (laughter). </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One more suggestion, and
                        then I am finished. In the last paragraph we would like to add one sentence.
                        We would like to say “the two sides agreed that they will stay in contact
                        through various channels,” and then we would say, “In addition the U.S.
                        Government will send a senior representative to Peking from time to time”
                        instead of “at irregular intervals.” The reason we would like to add this,
                        Mr. Vice Foreign Minister, is because as it is now written it gives the
                        impression that the only way we will be in contact with you is to send a
                        senior representative to Peking, and that gives the wrong impression to our
                        people. And it does not reflect the reality of the situation.</p>
                    <p>These are all the changes we have except for the issue of Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Just out of asking, what is your suggestion about South Asia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We do not have a very good
                        text yet because we want to discuss it with you. What we will say is that we
                        support the right of the people of South Asia to determine their future
                        without the threat or use of military force, and that we believe that their
                        future should not be subjected to interference from countries outside of the
                        region—something like that. We have not phrased it yet, but that is the
                        thought we are expressing.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We are very grateful to you for telling us your preliminary thinking.
                        And we also would like to tell you our preliminary thinking on this matter.
                        We consider this to be a realistic question. The Indian armed forces are
                        still occupying East Pakistan. The resolution passed by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly is not being implemented, so
                        there is a question of the withdrawal of the Indian armed forces, so we are
                        considering reflecting this thinking in our statement. This is only for some
                        preliminary ideas, and we have not yet really worked out a phrase. We will
                        still have further exchanges on this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think the President and
                        the Prime Minister will want to discuss this matter. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: What you have in writing you have already given us. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right. I have now
                        given you all our suggestions except for the crucial issue.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We will, of course, study all these views. Our preliminary impression
                        of these changes suggested is to make it stronger, and in some places it is
                        merely a matter of wording, and in some places it involves the matter of
                        substance. We will study these and give you our views.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d90-06" facs="d90-06"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Vice Foreign Minister,
                        how should we discuss the issue of Taiwan which is probably the crucial
                        issue in the Communique?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> to bring wording on this
                        crucial matter during General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>'s visit, and at that time we already made clear our
                        position which is that we do not approve of that suggestion. If you have any
                        new proposals to make on that matter it would facilitate our further
                        consideration of this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have no
                        counter-proposal?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Our position remains as follows—that is, the proposal for this Taiwan
                        question which we put forward and asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to bring back is the wording we consider to be
                        necessary. The thinking reflected in that we consider cannot be deducted—the
                        ideas. We consider that our proposal. In that proposal we already had taken
                        into account your various difficulties. So, frankly, speaking, we are
                        persisting on that proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me explain again what
                        our difficulties are. I think we have a fair understanding of the direction
                        in which we want to go. I think we realize that both of our countries are
                        engaged in an extremely delicate process. We are breaking our established
                        patterns and really changing the fact of international relations. Each of us
                        no doubt has domestic considerations which affect the freedom of maneuver we
                        have on specific matters. But I can only speak for ourselves; this is the
                        case with us. And we are approaching this with the attitude of moving from
                        contact to cooperation.</p>
                    <p>We are confronting also, as General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> pointed out to you, a very complex domestic situation.
                        The right and the traditional China Lobby is not itself very strong anymore,
                        but it still is more powerful than it looks. But if it can ally itself with
                        the pro-Soviet left and with the other forces that are pro-Japan, pro-India,
                        it can create tremendous pressure against the President's present course.
                        You must have noticed that during January a quite systematic anti-Chinese
                        campaign developed in the American press, based on the India policy, and
                        broke this in part through a step which you don't approve—the speech on our
                        negotiations on Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>So I simply want to explain to you what we confront, and we quite frankly
                        want to avoid a situation where the President comes back from Peking and is
                        accused of having been taken in, and therefore will not be able to do the
                        things which he has undertaken to do and which he will do.</p>
                    <p>So what we are looking for on Taiwan—and we recognize it is very difficult,
                        and I don't think your formulation was reasonable in the abstract—but we <pb n="7" xml:id="d90-07" facs="d90-07"/>are looking for something that
                        indicates a general direction without creating a tremendous domestic furor.
                        We will carry out all the commitments we have made, and indeed we have
                        already carried out some things such as not basing nuclear weapons on Taiwan
                        and storage, which is something which we did unilaterally. So we are not
                        talking about substance—we are talking about language.</p>
                    <p>Let me give you an example of what our problem is. I am sorry I am talking at
                        such great length. Harvard professors always speak 50 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: So long as it does not exceed 50 minutes. And Yale professors …</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: We are much more concise.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you need a junior
                        assistant in your foreign office (laughter)? I have always dealt with you
                        with sincerity and honesty, and let me tell you what we did when we came
                        back from our trip the last time. We did not show the Communique or the
                        existence of the Communique to anybody, but we did send the two paragraphs
                        on Taiwan to the Secretary of State. Those are the only two paragraphs he
                        has seen. He wrote a memo to the President with his suggestion of what these
                        two paragraphs should contain, and when you see them you will realize that
                        what we sent you with General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>
                        is relatively mild compared to what the State Department has recommended to
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>And this is, of course, a rather sensitive matter to show you an internal
                        document, but I have never seen any Anderson papers in the Peking Daily
                        (laughter). So if I could give this to you unofficially and confidentially
                        for the Prime Minister you might want to take a look at it. Of course, if
                        you accept them, our problems will be finished. Much of this is—the
                        underlined part is what he added.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: I am grateful to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        for your confidence in us. I can guarantee you there are no Anderson papers.
                        This is just an expression of our sincerity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not tabling this as a
                        proposal even though you see this is what I am supposed to do. I want to
                        show you we are making a sincere effort. But if we separate ourselves too
                        far we will have another set of Anderson papers, and we will be very
                        vulnerable to criticism that will limit our ability to do what we have
                        undertaken to do.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d90-08" facs="d90-08"/>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Please go on. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is our problem, and I
                        have actually not brought a text other than the one that General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> gave you. We are willing to modify
                        that text. I am a bad negotiator by telling you we are willing to modify.
                        But I thought we should have a preliminary discussion before we attempt to
                        play with it. If I could have your objections… what is it you object to most
                        in that text?… so that we could make an effort.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: I am thankful to you for telling us in such a frank way the
                        difficulties you are facing. And we, too, would like to very frankly tell
                        you our views on this matter. In speaking generally from both your side and
                        our side, we look upon this as a major step, particularly from your side and
                        from the side of your President. It is a major action, and as the President
                        and Chou said yesterday, from our point of view we appreciate this
                        action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which action?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: The visit from your President. We look at it as an event which is
                        unprecedented from our two countries.</p>
                    <p>As for the specific matters, you, of course, are more clear about the entire
                        process than I am. I am not as well acquainted as Mr.
                            <persName>Chang</persName>, who took part in all these discussions. As
                        for me, it is my first contact with this, and I would want to be very frank
                        with you in our discussions and I hope you will not look upon frankness as
                        being crude.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That adjective has never
                        crossed my mind with the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Well, but you said yesterday
                        you hoped I will not use the methods I used against
                            <persName>Malik</persName> with you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but not because they
                        were crude, but because they were very subtle. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: But actually I am a very bad negotiator and worse than you. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought the Vice Foreign
                        Minister treated Mr. <persName>Malik</persName> like a bullfighter treats a
                        bull - you had him charging all the time. </p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: He had too great self-confidence and arrogance.</p>
                    <p>So in a very frank way I would say my ideas in this matter. In the draft
                        which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> put forward at
                        the end of the interim visit, you mentioned still <pb n="9" xml:id="d90-09" facs="d90-09"/>in that draft “the U.S. accepts the ultimate objective of
                        withdrawal of forces on Taiwan.” And why is it that we do not agree to that
                        suggested version? We did not agree to it because Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said we must be clear on our
                        direction, but we must also be clear about our final objective. If we don't
                        have that objective in mind where will be the direction?</p>
                    <p>So, when I say I want to be frank I mean to say that the proposal put forth
                        by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> was a backward
                        step in comparison to the proposal you put forward in the interim. You say
                        you have your difficulties, but you can't say we don't have our
                        difficulties. And in our wording we put it—that is in the reply to you on
                        the question of our side also having difficulties—we put it in a very mild
                        way, because you should know, whether it would be a question of substance or
                        whether it would be a question of how to express it in words, the Chinese
                        people have very strong feelings.</p>
                    <p>While I was in New York, in many of the speeches made by your side—a number
                        of your speeches—it was always emphasized that your treaty obligations with
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> remain valid, but
                        you see in our version we do not mention the question of this so-called
                        treaty. And so our Chinese people would also ask us, why is it it was not
                        mentioned? So we can say that on our version it is already the lowest key
                        version which we could put forward.</p>
                    <p>Now, where are the differences? The difference is that in your version you
                        only talk about a reduction of forces without mentioning the final
                        objective. This is a point which we cannot agree. And then as to why you are
                        going to do this, it is not clearly stated in the version submitted by
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Can you explain that?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Let me finish. Since you are to acknowledge that the Taiwan question
                        is a question of the Chinese people themselves, then the logical and
                        inescapeable conclusion would be the final and complete withdrawal of
                        American forces.</p>
                    <p>So, there are two points. One is that this final objective must be made
                        clear, that is, complete withdrawal, and that is not made clear in this
                        proposal, and in that way it is not possible for us to make an accounting to
                        our people.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The second point?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: And the second point is that in the version submitted by General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> it was not made clear as
                        to why there will be this progressive reduction. The logical and the
                        inevitable reason for that should be—as you said—because you acknowledge all
                        Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is one China—that
                        should be the reason for the complete and final withdrawal. But in General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>'s version there is no
                        connection between the two, and it appears as if Taiwan is merely a tool of
                        the U.S.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d90-10" facs="d90-10"/>
                    <p>We do understand you do have your difficulties. It is not that we do not
                        understand. But you should also consider the fact that for our side we have
                        made great efforts.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not criticizing the
                        good faith, the seriousness, and fairness of your side. We have an objective
                        problem here which concerns less the actions than the words. We are not
                        attempting to take away from what I said to the Prime Minister, and what the
                        President will reaffirm to the Prime Minister, but we are trying to find a
                        formulation that maintains our authority to continue on this road.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: On the other aspect, and also very frankly, we say that you did have
                        your difficulties, but that at the same time you were able to overcome your
                        difficulties with people like JACK ANDERSON and company. They cannot play
                        such a high and mighty role. People came to your support.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is not Anderson. It is
                        that on this issue many of the President's oldest supporters have very
                        passionate feelings, and that they ally themselves with pro-Soviet elements.
                        They may try to use our Communique as an example to discredit everything.
                        Anderson we can handle.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: I think I have already made clear our reasons why we are not able to
                        agree either to the version Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> put forward in the interim visit or the version
                        put forward by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. To
                        put it in a nutshell, we are persisting in the substantive thing which I
                        have already elaborated. As for specific wording, however, for my side we
                        will be willing to consider that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My Yale colleague gave you
                        our last copy so you know more about it than I do. Let me ask it in an
                        informal way—is it possible for you to state that you want to assert your
                        sovereignty of Taiwan by peaceful means and not military means?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Frankly speaking, we cannot agree to that because that is a
                        fundamental violation of our principle—that it is an internal affair. It is
                        not possible for us to agree to have such a formulation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have not put it forward
                        for that reason.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: No misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought this would be
                        your position.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d90-11" facs="d90-11"/>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Of course, you know we have been talking about this for many years—16
                        years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The dilemma we face is
                        that, while your formulation is not unjust, it is for this year impossible
                        for us to say this. And therefore we have a question how to proceed. That's
                        really our problem. We are not debating the actions—we are now debating the
                        words, as I said before.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Today is a preliminary discussion. And then you also raise some other
                        questions. I will study these. And then there is this crucial question about
                        Taiwan. You look upon it as a question of expression. As we see it, it also
                        concerns substance.</p>
                    <p>For instance, the President said neither the Chinese nor the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had territorial designs against the other,
                        and so our people will then ask us since that is the case, how is it you
                        cannot agree to a final, complete withdrawal of your forces from Taiwan?
                        Because you know all our people will be reading the speech made by your
                        President yesterday. And in our version we merely put forward the
                        objective—there is no time limit and there are no other considerations which
                        I have mentioned. No mention of the treaty. We know, of course, your
                        difficulties in having to repeat that.</p>
                    <p>Our people constantly ask, and so this matter, I believe, the leaders of the
                        two governments will continue to discuss.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The difficulty is that the
                        American Congress lacks your subtly, and the American press lacks your
                        goodwill. They do not understand the absence of a reference on your part to
                        the treaty, nor that there is no time limit set on the withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>But let me understand again. Your two major objections are the absence of the
                        statement of the ultimate objective, and the seemingly conditional
                        formulation of the withdrawal which makes it appear as if Taiwan is held for
                        ransom by us.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: The ultimate objective of complete withdrawal. To make even more
                        clear our objectives: on the first question of wording but which also
                        involves substance, that is in our version it says “it hopes that a
                        settlement on the Taiwan question… ”, whereas in General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>'s version it says “reaffirms its
                        abiding interest.” And there is “an abiding interest,” where it says “it
                        hopes,” and there is “an abiding interest …. “ “Consistent with this
                        position”—the “position” means the position of the Chinese on either side of
                        the Straits—“that there is but one China.” This is not mentioned in your
                        version. But on your side, on the contrary, it is not linked up with that
                        position, but linked up with reduction of “tensions in the area” which makes
                        people think of Southeast Asia, China, etc. It makes it appear that Taiwan,
                        although it is Chinese territory, that it is being used as a base by the
                        U.S., <pb n="12" xml:id="d90-12" facs="d90-12"/>and that doesn't conform to
                        the position of the U.S. as stated before in the Communique. And certainly
                        it does not conform to our position.</p>
                    <p>And then the third point is that we mentioned “the U.S. will progressively
                        reduce and finally withdraw U.S. forces from Taiwan,” whereas in General
                        Haig's version it says “as tensions diminish…”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. I understand. We
                        have a difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: That is so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we understand your
                        concern. I think we fundamentally agree that this is a problem which we both
                        hope will be solved, and you have shown restraint in connection with it. But
                        we have necessities which are partly self-inflicted, but which nevertheless,
                        particularly this year, are very great.</p>
                    <p>Let me see whether I can do something to the version General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> gave you to take account of as many
                        of your concerns as is bearable to us. And maybe we can give you something
                        after the cultural event tonight. Do you have the Prime Minister's bad
                        habits?</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: The only thing is I smoke as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> All right, shall we meet
                        here after the performance tonight? Or rather wait for the translation.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: I think we will work it this way, to speed up the process. If you can
                        find the time to give us a written version of your thinking, because we too
                        need some time to study it, and our purpose is common. Both of us want to
                        find a way out. The Premier meets with the President, so there will not be
                        much time—so if you can give us something in writing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Should I meet someone here
                        tonight just for ten minutes? We will just give you the paper.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I raise one more
                        little quick question? Tomorrow night we shall meet, and we shall give you
                        what negotiations we are conducting prior to our meeting in Moscow, which
                        will take a little longer. There are details and schedules as I told the
                        Prime Minister yesterday. The President has asked me to give you some
                        information of a more sensitive nature on the dangers we think we both face.
                        So, it might be that you might want to have <pb n="13" xml:id="d90-13" facs="d90-13"/>somebody here who understands some of the military issues
                        involves so that we can explain it to him. It is entirely up to you. I think
                        it would be more beneficial to your side to have somebody here with
                        technological experience for me to give this information to. It is entirely
                        up to you.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: We will study that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We do it so that in any
                        future crisis we both know militarily what the problem is, such as that
                        which confronted on the subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Good. Then when shall we meet tomorrow morning?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: 10:00. So we will meet
                        briefly tonight after the cultural performance, and then again tomorrow at
                        10:00 a.m.</p>

                    <p>After an initial exchange of greetings, the Secretary opened the meeting by
                        thanking the Chinese for the graciousness of their welcome. One has to
                        experience Chinese hospitality to understand how well deserved is their
                        world-wide reputation in this regard. It was also now clear to him why the
                        Chinese and American people had such a high regard for each other.</p>
                    <p>The talks held between Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> have set the stage
                        for our talks, the Secretary continued. He hoped that the talks could
                        reflect the favorable attitudes of the two peoples for each other. The
                        history of the last 20 years have, he liked to think, been an aberration and
                        not the norm. It was time that we returned to the norm.</p>
                    <p>Expressing a personal note, the Secretary told the Foreign Minister that
                        everyone on the American side of the table had long felt the need for better
                        relations with the People's Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>). Of course differences would remain, but the purpose of
                        the talks was to find common ground and make what progress we could. As he
                        had told the Foreign Minister on the way from the airport, the United States
                        is prepared to proceed in any way the Chinese see fit, and at a pace of
                        their choosing. We recognize that the dramatic events we are involved in
                        create practical political problems for both of us. The U.S. is prepared to
                        take these problems into account and accommodate the Chinese standpoint in
                        the actions we take.</p>
                    <p>It is important, the Secretary continued, to develop a spirit of trust. We
                        are prepared to be both candid and discreet, disclosing only the information
                        about the talks upon which both sides agree. Hoping that both sides could
                        develop procedures for discussing questions informally and tentatively
                        without treating each idea as a firm proposal. The Secretary closed by
                        asking the Chinese how they wished to proceed.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> responded by welcoming the
                        Secretary and his delegation and expressing pleasure at the opportunity to
                        exchange views. The task for the <pb n="3" xml:id="d91-03" facs="d91-03"/>counterpart talks, as outlined at the plenary, had been to discuss the
                        specifics of the normalization process. Matters of principle can be touched
                        upon in the course of the specific discussions. As the Premier and President
                        had said, our discussions should be a frank search for common ground which
                        recognized the differences between us.</p>
                    <p>After an exchange on whether to discuss principles or specifics first, it was
                        agreed that specifics would be the first topic.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that we could not expect complete normalization. We are
                        looking for an improvement in relations which will move us in the direction
                        of normalization. “Normal” is a difficult word to define. We have relations
                        with some 140 countries. We have problems with all of them. It is difficult
                        to say with which ones of them our relations could be called “normal.” The
                        question before us now is how we can achieve better relations, while
                        recognizing that we have problems and that the difficulties will
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>The most important gesture, the Secretary continued, has already been made.
                        Your country has invited our President to visit. That beginning having been
                        made, it is now important that we set up some arrangement which will provide
                        for further communication and contacts. These are the points upon which we
                        should begin our specific discussions.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of ways to achieve better communication and contacts.
                        Before discussing these, the Secretary asked whether the Foreign Minister
                        agreed that this is the topic which should be discussed first.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister responded that exchanges between peoples were a good way
                        of improving contacts, and that in the absence of diplomatic relations it
                        would be better to concentrate on this means. To the Chinese, normalization
                        means establishment of diplomatic relations. Since we have none, our
                        relations are not normal. We believe that we can take some gradual steps to
                        promote <pb n="4" xml:id="d91-04" facs="d91-04"/>normalization. In the
                        process prior to normalization and the establishment of diplomatic relations
                        we prefer to stick to improvement of people-to-people contacts. The
                        Governments should assist in the process of improving people-to-people
                        contacts, the Foreign Minister concluded.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed that an improvement in people-to-people contacts was a
                        step towards normalization, and that the United States was prepared to move
                        as fast as the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> wished in facilitating
                        exchanges. At the same time he recognized that more people-to-people
                        contacts will involve increased government action. Let us start on the
                        principle of increased people-to-people contacts, while recognizing that we
                        will have to improve governmental communications and contacts at the same
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister responded that this is why he had said it was necessary
                        for governments to provide support so that people-to-people relations may
                        develop.</p>
                    <p>At this point the Foreign Minister said he understood that there was a
                        fingerprinting requirement for some people traveling to the United States.
                        After consulting with the U.S. delegation, the Secretary replied that he
                        believed the requirement no longer existed, but he would look into it. (Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Platt</persName> was sent to phone
                        Washington.)</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister observed that fingerprinting was a sensitive subject in
                        China, because in the old days landlords required the fingerprint of their
                        tenants on feudal agreements.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Platt</persName> returned and reported that
                        there is no longer any fingerprinting requirement.)</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister asked if the Secretary had any suggestions on the means
                        of improving communications.</p>
                    <p>The Seretary responded that we were flexible on this point, but thinks it
                        would be helpful if we had direct communications between the governments and
                        personnel to facilitate contacts. It did not matter how it was done or the
                        labels applied, e.g., trade office or interest section, as long as we can
                        agree on the principle. We will implement <pb n="5" xml:id="d91-05" facs="d91-05"/>it in any way the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        wishes in order to avoid impairing the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s
                        status. What is important is that there be a few people in the U.S. and in
                        Peking to take care of the practical problems of communication. (At this
                        point <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung Hsiang-hui</persName> got up and
                        left the room for a moment.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Platt</persName>'s experience just now in
                        calling Washington is a clear case in point the Secretary continued. Through
                        good communications, we were able to clear up instantly a misunderstanding.
                        The U.S., the Secretary continued, has good relations with Algeria without
                        formal diplomatic ties. In the case of Japan, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has worked out a channel of communication through trade
                        offices.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister responded that this was a question we should mark for
                        further study. We should try to work out some way to improve contacts and
                        communication. However, the Taiwan question does present problems. It does
                        not matter much if you have an organization in our country, but we can't
                        have one in yours, because there is a <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> embassy in Washington. Japan is a different case.
                        There, we have only a non-governmental trade organization.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked why the U.S. couldn't have a non-governmental trade
                        organization in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> replied that the Taiwan question is
                        central to our relationship. We may talk about exchanges and contacts, but
                        we always get back to Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung Hsiang-hui</persName> interjected that
                        these questions had been discussed during previous trips with Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZRL1">Ziegler</persName>. The problem of the Taiwan table tennis team was a
                        case in point. Last year the U.S. table tennis team visited China, and the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was all set to reciprocate. All of a
                        sudden in August the Chinese heard that a Taiwan table tennis team was
                        touring eight U.S. cities. Where did they get the visas?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH3">Hsiung</persName> that he
                        got the point and would do everything possible to avoid embarrassment in the
                        future. He explained that under our system travel to <pb n="6" xml:id="d91-06" facs="d91-06"/>and from the U.S. is made as easy as
                        possible, and that a case such as that of the Taiwan table tennis team might
                        not, and in this instance certainly did not come to his attention. (Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> interjected that the
                        incident was an error.) The incident, however, did not change the fact that
                        better contacts were needed. On the contrary, it was just the kind of
                        problem that could be avoided through better contact. The Secretary added
                        that he was in telephone contact with a large number of foreign ministers
                        who got in immediate touch with him when they had problems. While this might
                        not be possible now with China, it was something to think about for the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the question needed further study, but
                        agreed to look for further ways.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Exchanges</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister asked for the Secretary's views on exchanges.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the U.S. table tennis team had been beaten so
                        badly that we now acting under the principle of reciprocity had to find
                        programs in which American teams could beat the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister laughed and said that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> believed in friendship first and competition second. In any
                        case they would arrange to have the U.S. beaten by only a little bit.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that that was not good enough.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the free flowing conversation that followed, the Chinese
                        expressed interest in exchanges involving basketball, tennis, badminton, and
                        gymnastics. The Secretary agreed that gymnastics would be popular in the
                        U.S., and suggested touring tennis teams and clinics like the one run by
                        Arthur Ashe in Africa last year. He also suggested that some young American
                        swimmers might be a good contact point with Chinese youth.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether exchanges might be possible in the medical and
                        scientific fields and Foreign <pb n="7" xml:id="d91-07" facs="d91-07"/>Minister <persName>Chi</persName> replied, that Chinese doctors were
                        interested in travelling to the U.S. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was preparing to send delegates to the
                        environmental conferences in Stockholm.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Trade</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister asked for the Secretary's views on trade.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed the view that an expansion of trade, at whatever rate
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> wished, would improve relations
                        between the two countries. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had taken a number of steps to indicate our
                        willingness to expand trade. The U.S. thinks of trade with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> both in terms of political and economic
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>Speaking very frankly, the Secretary continued, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has developed a remarkable self-reliance and does not
                        really need trade with the U.S. For its part, the U.S. has developed its
                        tremendous industrial potential and trade contacts all over the world and
                        trade with China initially would have little economic significance. Thus
                        trade, the Secretary repeated, probably will have minimal commercial effect.
                        Rather, it is important as evidence of the improvement in our relationship.
                        If the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> decided that it did not wish
                        trade with the U.S. that was acceptable too. The U.S. is prepared to build
                        on the Presidentes and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s
                        initiative by other means. While relaxed about it, the U.S. believes trade
                        would nonetheless be of considerable mutual benefit, the Secretary
                        concluded, and asked the Foreign Minister for his views.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s
                        foreign trade was guided by the principles of equality and mutual benefit
                        and the exchange of needed goods. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        foreign trade volume was not large and depended upon domestic requirements.
                        The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> trades now with 120 countries, some
                        of which have no diplomatic relations with it. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would be willing to carry out a very limited amount of
                        trade with the U.S. on a non-governmental basis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that U.S. businessmen like to compete. Where they think
                        there is a market they will try to supply it. There is no way the U.S.
                        Government can keep them from expressing their interest.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d91-08" facs="d91-08"/>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> then raised the issue of Most
                        Favored Nation status, saying that he understood the U.S. would allow trade
                        but impose tariffs several fold by comparison with those imposed on the
                        goods of trading partners like Hong Kong which enjoy Most Favored Nation
                        status.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that many goods were under no tariff at all but he would
                        check on the details of Most Favored Nation tariff rates and inform the
                        Foreign Minister the next day. The important question was whether or not the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> wished to increase trade with the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the question of MFN treatment was of
                        importance. The materials which the Chinese side had on U.S. trade reflected
                        policies developed when the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        were hostile. However, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> does not
                        demand MFN treatment in order to expand trade relations on a limited
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that U.S. tariff statutes were not aimed at China.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that a significant expansion of trade would
                        require a change in the U.S statutes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary answered that the U.S. could not simply change its laws. In any
                        case, mutual benefit should rule. If the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        can benefit from trade with the U.S. and vice versa, let us have it. If not,
                        let's not. He did not wish to give the impression that the U.S. was pressing
                        for trade.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister told the Secretary that there were many corporations in
                        the U.S. which were anxious for trade with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and were pressing the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The
                        government might be relaxed about trade, but the corporation clearly wanted
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the U.S. Government had no control over private
                        companies. They exist to do business, and their eagerness has nothing to do
                        with the <pb n="9" xml:id="d91-09" facs="d91-09"/>government. The Secretary
                        then reiterated that the U.S. wanted trade, but that it was not essential to
                        an improvement in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> relations.
                        Experience in trading with communist countries had shown that they liked to
                        trade with the United States. The Yugoslavians and the Romanians were
                        constantly in touch with the U.S. on ways to increase trade.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister stated that he was now clear on the U.S. position and
                        felt that both sides understood each other better.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that some trade experience would be required to
                        eliminate the misunderstandings that were bound to crop up between communist
                        and democratic trading partners.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister stated that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was
                        prepared to issue invitations to a small number of companies to attend the
                        Canton Fair this spring. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has total
                        control and the problem will be easy to tackle.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed his pleasure at this, and offerred to consult on any
                        problems that might arise with American companies or businessmen. American
                        businessmen, the Secretary continued, are competitive, but they supply good
                        products and keep their word.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended with the Foreign Minister expressing a desire to exchange
                        views on general questions at the next meeting.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: This is the assistant to
                            <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshall Yeh</persName>. You know about the
                        other Chinese friends.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, I know about the
                        others. Mr. Vice Foreign Minister, I have brought a suggestion on Taiwan.
                        Should we put this aside to do the other thing first or which do you
                        prefer?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I would be happy if you
                        would give it to me first, and then we can translate it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will give you this
                        (copy at Tab A), and I want to explain to you what we attempted to do. It
                        may not meet your full suggestions, but we wanted to do what we could in the
                        light of your discussion yesterday. <pb n="2" xml:id="d92-02" facs="d92-02"/>We have taken the version that General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> brought to you and changed the word “abiding interest”
                        to “position.” Where it says “it reaffirms its abiding interest,” we have
                        said “it reaffirms its position.” And it added the phrase “through peaceful
                        negotiations between the parties directly concerned,” to make clear that we
                        don't consider ourselves a party to that negotiation. And we have
                        substituted the word “removal” for “reduction”—“the progressive removal,”
                        rather than “the progressive reduction.” And we have modified this phrase
                        “as tensions decrease.”</p>
                    <p>I have just tried to explain to the Vice Foreign Minister the spirit with
                        which we approached it, and why we did what we did. And I am certain—don't
                        insist on it but I am certain—he will have a counter-suggestion once he has
                        studied it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Thank you. After we have
                        studied this matter then we will continue our discussions further.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't want to leave
                        the wrong impression. I am, of course, delighted if he accepts it. I don't
                        want to encourage him to reject it.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I only hope that it would be
                        possible for us to accept it. I am only fearing that it may not be possible.
                        That's just joking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, of course. I have
                        two sets of subjects to discuss, one concerning some military information
                        which we wanted to pass on to you and secondly, a list of all the
                        discussions that are going on with the Soviet Union in preparation for the
                        summit and afterwards. Because my friend the Vice Chairman is here, I will
                        perhaps start with the military issues if this is agreeable to you. I do
                        this with apologies because I am not the expert on it, he is. I am a
                        doctrinaire; he is a practitioner.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Well, you are a military

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but not a
                        practitioner. I have very complicated theories that can never be
                        applied.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I give you, for a
                        minute, the origin of why the President thought we should have this
                        discussion. On December 10, I had a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName>, as the Vice Foreign Minister
                        remembers, in which the Ambassador expressed the view that perhaps on the
                        crisis in the Subcontinent we were not taking as strong a position as the
                        People's Republic. And I told him that we would pursue a parallel course,
                        and that we were going to make some preliminary military dispositions. On
                        the morning of December 12, we received a message from your Mission that you
                        wanted to see General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>—you
                        knew I was going to the Azores and therefore you asked for General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. We thought, and I will be honest
                        with you, we thought you were calling to inform us that you might intervene
                        militarily. I am explaining to you our thinking, not what you should have
                        done. We, the President and I, then had a discussion on what we would do if
                        you intervened, and if your northern neighbor then brought pressure on you.
                        You should know that we decided that if you came under military attack
                        yourself that we would take whatever measures were necessary to prevent
                        it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You mean if we were under
                        pressure or attack?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Both, You had not
                        requested this, and we did not do this for you, but for ourselves. I mention
                        this because it was a practical reality at this moment and not a theoretical
                        issue. And we had already told you this on the 10th, but General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> was instructed to reaffirm it if
                        your message had been what we incorrectly thought it was. We then, however,
                        as we were planning the practical side of this, did not know whether you
                        knew all the details of the dangers you faced or whether you could tell us
                        what would be most helpful to do if the greatest danger should happen. So
                        the President asked me on, obviously, an extremely confidential basis to
                        give you some of the information we possess and to tell you also that we are
                        prepared, without reciprocity, to give you additional information if you
                        request it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not… I am
                        obviously not an intelligence expert, but we are willing, if you want us to,
                        to establish a very confidential channel; or if you want to do it through
                        me, if you ask additional questions to attempt to reply to them. Now, I
                        repeat, we do this without any request for reciprocity, but with a request
                        for complete discretion. I think the Vice Chairman speaks better English
                        than he admits.</p>

                    <p>VC <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Well, the ability of our two
                        sides to maintain secrecy has already been tested on several occasions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: We must first of all maintain
                        confidence; only then is it possible to keep a secret.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we have taken
                        big steps toward establishing confidence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: On that you can rest
                        assured.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, Mr. Vice Chairman,
                        we have broken down this information by manpower and by various weapons. We
                        have information on the following: Ground Forces, Tactical Aviation,
                        Strategic Air Defenses, Strategic Bomber Forces, Strategic Rocket Forces and
                        some characteristics of weapons with nuclear warheads that are capable of
                        reaching you.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin with divisions. And we have a map of their approximate location
                        here. In the Far East Military District… do you know the boundaries of these
                        districts?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Somewhat.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is the Far East
                        Military District (showing map)—it's this area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Up to Vladivostok.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. There are up to 21
                        motorized rifle divisions; no less than 17, and they are building toward 21.
                        The uncertainty is because they move the headquarters first and then they
                        fill it out.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: May I ask some questions
                        now?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Please. If I don't know
                        the answer, I will get you an answer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: These divisions, they are
                        divided into infantry divisions, motorized divisions, and tank
                        divisions?</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d92-05" facs="d92-05"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Yes, I will give you the
                        tank divisions in a minute. The motorized rifle division has tanks also.
                        It's not moving on foot. It's moving by truck and carrier, and it has a
                        substantial number of tanks. But I cannot tell you how many tanks each of
                        the motorized rifle divisions have. What I can give you first are the
                        divisions ready to be used almost immediately; that is what I am giving you
                        now. What I will then give you is what can be used in a very brief time, say
                        one week; and then I will give you what can be used in one to three
                        weeks.</p>
                    <p>In addition, in the Far East Military District there are two tank divisions.
                        And the total number of tanks is between 4,300 and 5,000.</p>
                    <p>In the Trans-Baikal Military District—that's this one here (showing
                        map)—there are eight motorized rifle divisions, and two tank divisions, and
                        between 2,700 and 2,900 tanks.</p>
                    <p>In Mongolia - I don't have to show that to you on the map.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>…there are two motorized rifle divisions and one tank division and a total of
                        700 tanks.</p>
                    <p>In the Central Asian military district, which is here (showing map), there
                        are six motorized rifle divisions, one tank division, and a total of 1,900
                        tanks.</p>
                    <p>So the total in these districts is some 43 divisions, in all four districts,
                        and about between 9,600 and 10,500 tanks. In addition, in the Siberian
                        military district, which is right behind Mongolia, and therefore available
                        within less than a week, are three motorized rifle divisions and one tank
                        division and 900 tanks. In the Turkestan military district—the Turkestan
                        military district we consider a one-week reinforcement to the Central Asian
                        military district—there are five motorized rifle divisions, one tank
                        division and 1, 200 tanks. In the Far East military district, but not right
                        on your border—we are talking about reinforcements now, there are three
                        motorized rifle divisions in addition to the 23 divisions I gave you before.
                        And they have 600 tanks.</p>
                    <p>The second category now was reinforcement, and thirdly is what we consider
                        the strategic reserve which can be used for these purposes. We are not
                        counting Western Russia. These divisions would have to call up <pb n="6" xml:id="d92-06" facs="d92-06"/>reserves. There are 12 motorized rifle
                        divisions, nine tank divisions, and 5,000 tanks. And then, of course, you
                        know that there are seven airborne divisions which are hard to count because
                        they can be moved. They are not located near your borders, but they could be
                        moved. So if you count all of these reinforcement divisions, the total
                        number—and all the strategic reserve—our estimate is that there is a total
                        of 55-60 motorized rifle divisions, and 17 tank divisions. This includes
                        17,300 to 18,200 tanks. And our estimate is that including ground forces,
                        KGB border guards, the border guards of the secret police (there are 70,000
                        of these), military transport, strategic defense—everything that is
                        currently available for deployment against the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is between 1,115,000 and 1,170,000 men. And in wartime, it
                        would be 1,865,000 to 1,915,000, that is if reserves are called up. This is
                        without shifting forces from western Russia. These are the numbers. Let me
                        now turn to … do you have any questions?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: That is all the ground
                        forces?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have a map here of
                        the approximate locations of the divisions, but I will discuss that
                        afterward. Oh, the total number I gave you included also air forces. When I
                        gave you over a million, that included everything. That included also the
                        air forces and others … and naval that I am going to give you. It included
                        some 100 thousand naval personnel. The divisions were obviously only ground
                        forces. The total number included air forces, but apparently not the combat
                        air force, not the tactical air force. Everything except the tactical air
                        force. The one million 115 thousand included all the military personnel
                        available for action except the tactical air force. The tactical air force
                        has about 40,000 personnel… oh no, excuse me, it is included, Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> is my military expert
                        here.</p>
                    <p>Let me now turn to two categories, tactical air force adjacent to China plus
                        tactical rockets adjacent to China. Of course, here it is very easy to
                        reinforce. And there are very large air forces in Europe. So we are talking
                        only of what is permanently stationed adjacent to China. First, I would talk
                        about tactical interceptors. That's <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17,
                            <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19 and <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21. <pb n="7" xml:id="d92-07" facs="d92-07"/>In the Far
                        East military district there are 144; in the Trans-Baikal military district
                        there are 144; in Mongolia there are 108; in the Central Asian military
                        district there are 144; in the Turkestan military district there are 72. In
                        the strategic reserve, suitable for this purpose, there are 174 and the
                        total available is 786. I don't have here what they have in Europe in
                        tactical aircraft. Before I leave here I will find out from Washington what
                        of the air force in Western Russia we think could be shifted. It isn't
                        included here.</p>
                    <p>The second category is fighter bombers. That includes MUG-17 and SU-7. The
                        numbers are as follows: Far East military district 72, Trans-baikal military
                        district 108, Mongolia 36; Central Asian military district 36; Turkestan
                        military district 36; strategic reserve 36, and a total of 324.</p>
                    <p>For light bombers, which are the IL-28 and YAK-28, the numbers are as
                        follows: Far East military district 40, Trans-Baikal military district 40,
                        none in Mongolia or the Central Asian military district. In fact, that's 80
                        all together.</p>
                    <p>Now for reconnaissance aircraft, but some of these could be used for dual
                        purposes, most of them</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): Most?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Some, we could get the
                        figures on how many bombers could be converted for reconnaissance purposes.
                        These are MUG-21, IL-28, and YAK-28. There are 88 in the Far East military
                        district; 72 in the Transbaikal military district; 30 in the Central Asian
                        military district; 16 in the Turkestan military district; 30 in the
                        strategic reserve, for a total of 236.</p>
                    <p>The total number of aircraft therefore facing you—this is without
                        reinforcement from western Russia and Europe—is 1,426. And the total number
                        of personnel is 45,000 plus 10,000 in the strategic reserve, or 55,000.</p>
                    <p>As for helicopters, there are 211 in the Far East military district. I will
                        tell you the truth. I can't believe our intelligence is so good that we can
                        say 211 rather than about 210. I am impressed.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>

                    <p>I don't think we have a man there who counts them every month, but maybe. 132
                        in the Trans-Baikal military district; 40 in Mongolia; 25 in the Central
                        Asian military district; 48 in the Turkestan military district; 66 in the
                        strategic reserve, or a total of 522. This does not include naval
                        helicopters or naval aircraft, none of this.</p>
                    <p>Now, as long as we are speaking of tactical weapons, there are three others
                        that are missiles, that are not aircraft. There is one tactical weapon to
                        which we give the name of “FROG” that has a range of 155 miles. It's on a
                        track; it's mobile. The newest version of it has wheels and most of it is in
                        the newest version. The old version has a range of 155 miles, and the new
                        version has a range of about 311 miles. This can have both a conventional
                        and a nuclear warhead. And if it has a nuclear warhead it can range from 3
                        kilotons to 20 kilotons in the old version and 40 to 90 kilotons in the new
                        version. This is what the old version looks like (shows picture). This is
                        what the new version looks like (shows picture).</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The way these are
                        assigned is each division has four launchers. That means that in the Far
                        East military district there are 76 to 84. In the Trans-Baikal military
                        district there are 28 or 32. In Mongolia there are 12. In the Central Asian
                        military district there are 28. Or a total of 144 to 156 are in these four
                        districts. Then in the Siberian military district there are 28. In the
                        Turkestan military district there are 18. Then in the Far East military
                        district, farther back than can reach you but available for reinforcement,
                        are 9. In interior districts, east of the Urals, are 73. Or a total of
                        272-284.</p>
                    <p>Now let me turn to another tactical missile. It doesn't matter what we call
                        it, because I don't even know what the name we give it means in English.
                        It's a short-range ballistic missile which has a range of 160 nautical
                        miles. This is more modern than the “FROG” and it has an accuracy of about a
                        quarter of a mile. This is newer than the old version of the “FROG,” but the
                        new version of the “FROG” is newer than this. This can be used with both
                        conventional and nuclear warheads, but we think that all of these weapons I
                        am giving you have nuclear warheads. This has tracks.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Two-stage or one-stage?</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d92-09" facs="d92-09"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One-stage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: And on the nuclear version, how
                        many kilotons?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: From ten to 100. They
                        have four different warheads, 10, 20, 40, or 100 kilotons, but we don't know
                        which they have on which. In the Far East military district, of this type
                        missile they have 12 to 18. In the Trans-Baikal military district, they have
                        six. In the Siberian military district they have six. In the Turkestan
                        military district they also have six. There is a total of 30 to 36. We know
                        the locations. All of these are nautical mile ranges. It's also true of the
                        range we gave for the “FROG.”</p>
                    <p>Then there is the third missile. When I get back I will ask to be introduced
                        to the man who gives them names. I want to know his mind.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>But I can tell the Vice Chairman it's a good way to learn English because I
                        am learning words that I didn't know.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>This is a single-stage rocket which has liquid fuel and which has a range of
                        500 nautical miles. It has warhead which has an accuracy of between a
                        quarter of a mile to a half mile, and a warhead of up to one megaton. They
                        seem to like to put them very close to your border. They are not designed to
                        travel over much of Soviet territory. The following face you: In the Far
                        East military district nine, mostly in the southern part, here (pointing to
                        map), and very close to the southern border. It's that blue dot here. In the
                        Trans-Baikal military district, nine, about here (pointing); it's the blue
                        dot. In the Central Asian military district, nine near Sary Ozek. Each of
                        them has nine to twelve launchers; we gave you the lower figure. In the
                        Siberian military district, there are also nine; so all together it's either
                        36 or 48. We think 36, but it could be 48. </p>
                    <p>There is one other which is like a naval missile of which they have four,
                        which has a range of 300 nautical miles.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: All together four?</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d92-10" facs="d92-10"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Four, that's all we
                        have found. It's unreasonable that they have only four, but that's all we
                        have seen. It's illogical but that's all we know about. It goes at low
                        latitude and 300 nautical miles and has a warhead of from ten to lOO
                        kilotons, and it's on a track. It's located here, the one we know about.
                        It's the green dot.</p>
                    <p>Now with regard to air defense forces, these were not in the total. The
                        numbers I give you now are in addition to the numbers I gave you before. No,
                        excuse me, the number of troops are in, the number of planes are in
                        addition. The air defense is different; they have different military
                        districts for air defense than they have for ground. These are the air
                        defense districts. So when we talk about Far East military district, you
                        will know what we mean (shows map). But they have different names for these
                        districts than for the other districts I have given you.</p>
                    <p>Airplanes for air defense are as follows: in the Far East air defense
                        district, 490; in the Trans Siberian air defense district 200; and in the
                        Tashkent air defense district, 230. About half of them are all-weather
                        MACH-2 aircraft. These are all the air forces that are within 300 miles. The
                        forces I am giving you are 'within 300 miles of the Chinese border.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): Nautical miles?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): Speed is MACH 2?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. In addition to
                        this there are 560 interceptor aircraft that are in central Russia that
                        could be used here. Now, turning to surface-to-air missiles within 300 miles
                        of your border, in the Far East air defense district …</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): The distance is all in nautical
                        miles?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I suppose, but what is
                        the difference?</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): A little bigger than a mile.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not absolutely
                        sure, but it doesn't make any difference for air defense. In the Far East
                        air defense district there are 130 <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s.
                        Eighty-one of these are what we call <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-2; 34
                        are <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-3's; <pb n="11" xml:id="d92-11" facs="d92-11"/>and 15 are <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-5's. The 2's
                        and 3's are what they have in Vietnam. You may have some of them yourselves,
                        but at any rate that's what they are. In the Trans-Siberian air defense
                        district there are 76 <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-2's and 19 <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-5's. These are sites; each site has more than
                        one of these missiles. We are talking about sites, I think each site has
                        four missiles. Well, they certainly have more than one missile at each
                        site—I know that;— we are going to check. For example, on the <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-2's, there are two launchers on one truck. On
                        the <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-3's there are two launchers on one
                        truck. But it is impossible that they would have only one missile at one
                        site. And there are 63 in the Tashkent district, 63 <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-2 sites. One <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-3 site, and
                        11 <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-5 sites. And there are five SA-2 sites
                        in Mongolia.</p>
                    <p>With respect to radar, there are 155 radar sites in the Far East district,
                        140 in the Trans-Siberian district; and 80 in the Tashkent district. So
                        altogether, there are 375 radar sites facing you.</p>
                    <p>I will just give you a few other items and then we will let it go. About
                        naval forces, the Pacific fleet has 155 medium bombers; 16 ballistic missile
                        submarines; which have a total of 113 missiles; and 23 cruise missile units
                        which have altogether 150 launchers.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): Surface aircraft?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, launchers.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): But surface?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, these are all on
                        submarines.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): What do you mean by 23 cruise …</p>
                    <p>Comdr. <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>: Guided by radar rather
                        than a ballistic missile.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Most of these are based
                        in Vladivostock except for the ballistic missile submarines which operate
                        out of Petropavlovsk. That's what a cruise missile submarine looks like.
                        Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> is a submariner. So
                        every time the Soviet Union gets one more he comes to my office. To make him
                        feel at home he has an office without windows.</p>
                    <p>Comdr. <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>: That's true.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He stays in it for two
                        months at a time so he remains in training.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d92-12" facs="d92-12"/>
                    <p>Comdr. <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>: That's also true.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> These are the major
                        forces. When we go to strategic forces there is no sense listing what's
                        adjacent to you because when we cometo strategic forces—bombers, missile
                        submarines, and land based missiles they have long ranges. For example,
                        there are 260 SS-9 missiles adjacent to China, but they have a range of 5,
                        000 nautical miles. I know they could reach the United States. It has a
                        range of 5, 000 miles arid altogether they have 970 of them, so if they want
                        to they can use them all against either China or the United States. They
                        have a total of 1, 500 long-range missiles that can be used either against
                        China or the U. S. and we don't want to discriminate. They may all be
                        directed against you—perhaps they are all directed against us. 519 of them
                        are in military districts adjacent to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, but it would be incorrect to assume that these are the
                        ones that are targeted on the People's Republic.</p>
                    <p>All this is the basic information. In addition, there are 205 heavy and
                        medium bombers of the long-range aviation forces, and they are directed at
                        you. In the Central Asian military district there are 45; in the
                        Trans-Baikal military district there are 50, and in the Far East military
                        district there are 110. The total if 205. Of these, 45 have a radius of
                        4,500 nautical miles, and they are turboprop, TU-45. And they can carry
                        30,000 pounds of bombs (shows picture). You must know it. There are 45 in
                        the Central Asian military district. It's a turboprop.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): 30 or 35 thousand pounds of
                        bombs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: 30,000. Then they have
                        medium bombers, 120 of these 205 have a range of 1,600 nautical miles. Fifty
                        are in the Trans-Baikal military district and 70 in the Far East military
                        district, and these are jets. The speed of the “BEAR” is about 450 kts, the
                        maximum is 500 and the normal is 435 knots. That's of the former (BEAR) and
                        on this one (Badger) it's 445 normal and 540 kts. maximum. Then in the Far
                        East military district they have 40 of another plane which has a range of

                    <p>All this is the information we thought we should give you today. And none of
                        our colleagues here know that we have given you this information and nobody
                        in our government except for the President and these people here know that
                        we have given you this information. The intelligence people do not know we
                        have given it to you. We have only asked them to prepare it for us. It is a
                        sign of… so that if we face other crises we have the same basic information
                        on which to make decisions.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: I am grateful to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and our other American friends
                        here for informing us of the most confidential information concerning the
                        Soviet military strength.</p>
                    <p>First, I would like to have our American friends rest assured that we will
                        certainly keep all this information absolutely secret, and secondly, I would
                        like to say that this material which you provided us is very useful. And
                        thirdly, I would like to say that in providing us with this most
                        confidential information it is an important indication of the sincere desire
                        of the United States Government to improve our relations and for this we
                        would like to express our thanks to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We did it for both of
                        us.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: We understand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you have any
                        additional questions, either while we are here or afterward, you can either
                        contact me or we can set up a separate means of contact. And if we get
                        indications of drastic changes in the deployments, it would be helpful if
                        you could let us know whom we should inform. Paris may be a little too
                        complex for that purpose. But actually we can send somebody to Paris to tell
                        your Ambassador there, but it makes no difference. You tell us whom we
                        should tell and where and what is your most secure place and we will send
                        someone there. But perhaps you could give us either a word so you can get us
                        a message or tell us how to do it in a more restricted way than normal in a
                        place you designate. Perhaps before we leave.</p>

                        brought along a discussion of every negotiation that is being conducted with

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We wanted to inform you
                        of all negotiations we are conducting with the Soviet Union. We understand
                        that part of the Soviet strategy is to create the impression that they and
                        we are establishing a two-power directory over the world. And therefore they
                        have started negotiations on a whole range of topics, some of very secondary
                        importance, especially since my visit to Peking last July. Our policy is to
                        make those agreements that are also in our own interest, to inform you of
                        every negotiation we are conducting, to do nothing that looks to us as if it
                        could be collusion against you (and therefore we did not, for example, agree
                        to that conference of the five nuclear powers), to be prepared to make any
                        agreement with you that we are making with the Soviet Union and to, if you
                        want to comment, to take your views very seriously. So should I run through
                        what is going on?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It could be that I am
                        breaking the Harvard record for length again.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Doesn't matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: First, you are familiar
                        with the negotiations on Berlin. We keep you informed of this. Incidentally,
                        again, no one in our government knows the degree to which we have kept you
                        informed. There are now negotiations between the East and West Germans on
                        the practical implementation of the agreement and there are some convoluted
                        German legalistic problems. But we think that these treaties will be
                        concluded by the summer. Incidentally, it is our impression that the Soviet
                        Union is saving a number of technical agreements so that they will all be
                        signed at or near the summit in Moscow, but I am sure you are wise enough to
                        understand that this does not signify anything in particular.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of technical agreements that the signature is being held
                        up on and we are sure they will come to a head around that time. In any
                        event, as you know, the President has offered the Prime Minister yesterday
                        that he would send me to Peking if you agree in June and I would then give
                        you an account in the frankness with which we have always treated you.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: European Security
                        Conference: The Soviet Union is being active both with us and with our
                        European friends to convene a European Security Conference. They are more
                        precise about the fact that they want a conference than what they want to
                        discuss there. Their strategy is to get a general atmosphere of relaxation
                        in Europe, partly to free their resources in that area. We are under great
                        pressure from our European friends to go to such a conference. Our strategy
                        is to say that we will not oppose it in principle, but that we want to see
                        what is on the agenda first. So at the moment we are delaying. We may agree
                        to exploratory, low-level talks later this year, but we do not expect a
                        conference before 1973.</p>
                    <p>Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions: Again, the Soviet Union has talked
                        about it in principle, but they have shied away from discussion of
                        specifics. Our position is stated in the World Report, and that represents
                        our actual position. I know. the Report didn't get a good review in the
                        Peking publications …</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Our approach is to talk on very concrete issues in such a way that they
                        cannot get disarmament just by talking about it but only by taking specific
                        steps. I must be very honest with you in this regard. If the negotiations
                        were to be successful—they will in any event take a long time, but if they
                        are successful—the objective consequence will be for the Soviet Union to
                        move some forces from Europe to the Far East, and we will have to make up
                        for this in some way. In any event, I do not believe that negotiations will
                        start in the first half of this year, if then. I don't think they will start
                        before the end of this year, and they will certainly take two years to
                        complete.</p>
                    <p>The next issue is the Chinese participation in the disarmament conference.
                        When it reconvenes in February, we frankly do not know whether you want to
                        be invited to be co-chairman, whether you want to participate; and therefore
                        we have adopted a neutral position. I am talking about the 18-nation
                        conference. If you want to participate … we will not put pressure on you to
                        join, but also we don't want to oppose your joining and therefore we have
                        avoided the issue. If you could let us know your preference we will be
                        heavily influenced by it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Our delegation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has expressed an attitude and our position
                        has not changed from that attitude. That is, we do not plan to <pb n="16" xml:id="d92-16" facs="d92-16"/>take part in that conference. And we have
                        noted that you are taking a neutral interest on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are in your history
                        familiar with the American missionary instinct, and the members of our Arms
                        Control Agency always hope that they can persuade you to be what they
                        consider more reasonable. We shall maintain our position and you will not
                        come under any pressure from us. The same is true of the Soviet proposal on
                        a world disarmament conference—we will not join it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So the United Nations passed
                        a resolution to postpone?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right, but we
                        will undoubtedly be approached again by the Soviet Union before the next
                        General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Comprehensive Test Ban: Those negotiations are hung up on a technical issue
                        whether you can discover underground explosions without inspection. If there
                        are negotiations on that this year, we will move very slowly. You are
                        familiar with the treaty banning nuclear weapons from the seabed?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: (Nods)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Rather than read it,
                        why don't I give you its provisions and you can study it yourself. The same
                        for the treaty banning biological weapons. I do it to save time. (The papers
                        used by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in this
                        briefing are at Tab C.) Don't you think that's better.</p>

                        Minister spoke to a group of Japanese about last year's Report. That was
                        before it was known we had met, and I thought he made the best analysis of
                        the Report I had seen anywhere. It's our experience with the Japanese that
                        they cannot keep any secrets.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but I find that
                        anything we tell them they tell the press.</p>
                    <p>VM Chaio: For instance, your talk …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Oh, I was not taken in
                        by the socialist. First, I didn't want to see him, so the Japanese
                        Ambassador called me and told me it would be a terrible loss of face for the
                        Ambassador if I didn't see him. I did. I knew he would talk to the press
                        because they always do. So I said nothing. Every time he asked me a
                        question, I said read my press conference; it's all in our process
                        conference. And I was astonished when the Prime Minister said to General
                        Haig that I had given him my impressions on the Taiwan question, I wasn't
                        taken in; they just invent things now.</p>

                        example of that Japanese socialist party leader showed the Japanese are very
                        good at keeping secrets, because they said nothing about what you really

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Here is the status on

                        the agreement on health. We have an agreement to negotiate on health
                        matters, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Soviets conducted that
                        negotiation that the agreement is made at the time of the Summit. This is an
                        agreement on civil aviation. I am just doing this to be correct—none of this
                        is of any great importance. And on environmental cooperation. And on
                        maritime <pb n="18" xml:id="d92-18" facs="d92-18"/>matters. Some of these I
                        have informed you of. Here is talks on preventing incidents at sea. I have
                        told you of this through the other channel. These are technical diplomatic
                        matters. I have some topics I would like to explain to you because they are
                        of great importance.</p>
                    <p>The first is <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>. We believe that an
                        agreement will be reached this spring. Right now, the Soviet Union has taken
                        the position on defensive missiles—offering us a compromise, by which they
                        can get four defensive sites and we can get one.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>But since even we know the difference between four and one we are not likely
                        to accept that.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>And so we will probably … the agreement … we have not negotiated it yet, and
                        in fact we have not yet adopted our own position, but it will have a more or
                        less equal number of defensive missiles on both sides. The Soviet Union
                        would defend Moscow and we would defend an offensive missile base, with each
                        side having an option for another site, so we can defend Washington and they
                        can defend an offensive site. This is what I think the agreement will be.
                        And there will be also a limitation on offensive missiles. We have more or
                        less agreed to stop building land-based missiles on both sides. We have not
                        yet agreed on submarines. We will keep you informed through our channel but
                        this is the present state of the negotiation. We know you are not interested
                        in participating, but we will avoid positions which can be used as a
                        pressure against you. And of course we will not participate in any pressure
                        against you.</p>
                    <p>A second area in which the Soviet Union has been extremely active is in
                        attempting to negotiate an economic agreement with us. They have offered to
                        negotiate a settlement on the lend-lease issues and the purchase of
                        grains.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I would like to take this
                        opportunity to ask Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> what
                        is the figure of the lendlease which you paid the Soviet Union in the Second
                        World War?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't have it here—I
                        will get it for you before we leave. I will have it in 48 hours. I can give
                        it to you very soon. The figure that is <pb n="19" xml:id="d92-19" facs="d92-19"/>now being discussed, I think they have offered, is 300
                        million and I think we believe it is closer to a billion that they owe
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): Dollars?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Our figure I
                        believe is 800 million on the debt, but I am sure we gave them more aid than
                        this during the war. We will get you the figure.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What they are now
                        proposing is that we send our Secretary of Commerce to Moscow again to begin
                        discussion of agreements including some credits and “most-favored-nation”
                        status. We may do this, we may send the Secretary of Commerce there. Our
                        general policy is to have the People's Republic on the same status in our
                        legal considerations as the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: May I interrupt a
                        moment?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: The question of trade
                        between China and the United States was not mentioned in our original draft
                        communique and only when General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> came he mentioned your side desired we say a few words
                        about this matter of the development of Sino-American trade. But now we are
                        somewhat confused because in discussions between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Chi Peng-fei, our impression is
                        you are not very interested in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, what General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> told you is correct. We
                        would like to mention it in the communique and are prepared to discuss it.
                        The difficulty is that not all of our people are familiar with every
                        communication which has gone to you because we don't want to embarrass you
                        through leaks. But we gave you a paragraph yesterday.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes, we are studying it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know, but we are
                        interested in it, and 1 will talk to the Secretary of State about clearing
                        up this confusion.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Just because you mentioned
                        this question of trade, so I said it in passing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. As I told the
                        Prime Minister, we are much more <pb n="20" xml:id="d92-20" facs="d92-20"/>complicated than you are in our method of government. But after the
                        election we will bring this into greater consistency.</p>
                    <p>On the Middle East, you are familiar with the discussions that we have
                        attempted to be set up between the Egyptians and the Israelis, indirect
                        discussions. The Soviet Union has told us that they would raise the issue at
                        the Summit. But we don't know in what form, and with what proposals. But
                        this will be one of the topics when I come here in June, if that is
                        agreeable to you. We will give you a complete account of what was
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>Two more items, one which you can read yourself, is the technical problem of
                        space exploration. That will probably be signed at the Summit, or just
                        before or just after. It's been discussed for two years but there is a
                        sudden acceleration on a lot of these things. There were reports in our
                        press that we were discussing arms control in the Indian Ocean with the
                        Soviet Union—that is correct.</p>
                    <p>These are the major items and we will keep you meticulously informed. Don't
                        pay attention to press reports. If I have not told you, it isn't true. We
                        believe that we must have a relationship of confidence, and we don't believe
                        in trickery. We will inform you always well ahead of time so that if you
                        wish to comment—which you have not up to now done—we are prepared to hear
                        your views and take them very seriously.</p>
                    <p>Now I have only one other question which is, how we should handle the
                        completion of the communique. Practically, not the details, the
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Well, first of all I will
                        thank you for giving us this information. And this is also an indication of
                        your wish to improve our relationship. I will say no more on that. I will
                        report all this to Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                        and to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Now the question is how to work out the communique. It involves how to
                        arrange our time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: First of all, we will want
                        to study your new wording of the Taiwan question and then after we have
                        studied it we can discuss it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, of course.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d92-21" facs="d92-21"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: This afternoon there will be
                        the discussions between the President and Prime Minister, and we are all
                        taking part in that. As for tomorrow morning, are you going to that?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am prepared not to
                        go. I think in fact it would be better if we worked. Of course you could
                        tell me tonight you are accepting all our proposals.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Then you can go to the Great
                        Wall.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Slip me a note at the
                        gymnastics.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It might be possible that
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will have a stomach
                        ache tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was ill in Key
                        Biscayne in January; I was really ill with the flu, and the press insisted
                        that one member talk with me on the telephone to make sure I wasn't in Cuba
                        or someplace. But how about tomorrow morning?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Our thinking is it would
                        probably be more realistic to continue the work tomorrow because tomorrow is
                        the 24th. As for the specific time when we will do the work tomorrow, I will
                        tell you this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be important
                        if we could agree on something that I can show my colleagues so they are not
                        too surprised at the last minute about how this came into being. So if we
                        could agree, not on the whole thing, but on some key questions, that this is
                        our position, it would help us. When do you think we should release the
                        communique. This was one question I wanted to ask you.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We have no particular
                        inclination as to when it should be issued to the press.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Sunday night?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: When we are in Shanghai?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, or what is your
                        thought?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Once we have finalized it,
                        it is up to you to say what date is better for you. We give you
                        priority.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d92-22" facs="d92-22"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But at any rate, before
                        we leave here.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That's all right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Two possibilities,
                        Sunday night or Monday morning. But Monday morning our press will not have
                        time to file it. Our plan is that when we release the communique—so far we
                        haven't said there will be one—but our plan is I will meet with the press
                        and explain it to them because otherwise they will write very confusing
                        things.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: In Peking?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After we release
                        it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: But you will meet with the
                        press in China?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. We would give them
                        the communique and then I Would explain to them how it came into being and
                        what it means. And I would agree with you what I would say and I would say
                        nothing that you and I and the Prime Minister haven't, agreed on.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: In Shanghai?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we do not do this
                        there will be the wildest speculation. We can do it as a joint one if you
                        want to so you can correct me if I say anything wrong.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Please, spare me this
                        ordeal. You are more experienced in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As a Harvard professor,
                        I can use many words to say nothing.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>When they don't understand it, they think I am very profound. I think it is
                        in our common interest that I explain it so there is one major theme that
                        emerges. That way I can work out exactly what I will say, and how I will
                        explain it. We can go through how I will explain it paragraph by paragraph.
                        That way it has the least possibility of embarrassment and the maximum
                        possibility of a positive impact.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="d92-23" facs="d92-23"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Good, we understand. As for
                        when we will work on the communique tomorrow, I will tell you this
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but we are
                        prepared not to go to the Great Wall. I have been there.</p>
                    <p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>: Yes, we should have quite
                        sufficient appraisal of the impact of the communique in the world. So it is
                        a matter over which both sides should give serious consideration.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, that's why we
                        shouldn't leave it to the end.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Let's get down to business now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was afraid he would
                        say that. I was certain I would get a note last evening saying you had
                        accepted every proposal and I should go to the Great Wall.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: What he will propose will make you even more
                        happy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's not his record.
                        May I make a suggestion—the paragraph where we say, “The U. S. side stated .
                        . “ (on our page 3 and 4). We have reordered the sentences. Every sentence
                        is the same, but we have reordered them, moving the last sentence beginning,
                        “The United States desires to work with …” We have moved that sentence and
                        the next sentence to the beginning of the paragraph, to become the second
                        sentence. I have it written here. It's purely stylistic. There is no new
                        sentence in it. It reads better from an American point of view. <pb n="2" xml:id="d93-02" facs="d93-02"/>And then the rest is exactly the same.
                        There is nothing changed, and we put the subcontinent sentences in brackets
                        only because we have agreed we will change them. That's the old text.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> Ch'iao: My preliminary impression of that
                        is that it is not a problem, but we would like to study it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, study it. Our
                        intention is not to change anything but to make the English sound better. I
                        also have received the answers on some of these things that we discussed
                        yesterday. We can either give it to you or you can schedule another
                        half-hour with the Vice Chairman. Some questions that came up yesterday,
                        such as how many missiles and so on, and I have the answers now. It will
                        take about half an hour. We shouldn't do it now.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We can discuss it directly between ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At the end of the
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: If there is time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is, we will work according to the draft submitted
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: On the first page. First is the question of mere factual
                        presentation, and then if there are any changes necessary for specific facts
                        we will change it. It is not impossible to discuss that. The question of the
                        full names of the President or Secretary of State, whether that should be
                        done or not. The full name Milhous, or M., and the middle name of the
                        Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Since I have my middle
                        name there?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am beginning to
                        understand the Chinese mind. Either all middle names or no middle names.
                        Thank you very much.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d93-03" facs="d93-03"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Page 2, first paragraph, we agreed to your suggestion, and we
                        agreed to say … to put the first sentence in front of this paragraph. 'The
                        two sides are gratified to have this opportunity to present candidly to one
                        another … The leaders of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reviewed the international situation”,
                        and so on. We will type this out later on.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you mind if I delete
                        one more thing, strictly for style? Could we just say, “expounded their
                        respective positions"? Because we already said in the previous sentence ”…
                        to present frankly to one another their views.” It's really stylistic. I
                        would like to drop “and views” but I don't care. It's just not to repeat the
                        same word twice.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: While basically accepting the former suggestion you put forward
                        yesterday, we have one addition. That is to say, “The leaders of China and
                        the United States …” because it is the beginning of a new paragraph. “The
                        leaders of China and the United States were gratified to have this
                        opportunity…”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely. You are
                        quite right.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Why not?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely. It's an
                        improvement. And then we should begin the next sentence, 'They reviewed …”
                        We don't have to repeat “the leaders.” I just told Mr. Lord that your staff
                        gives you as much trouble as mine does. (laughter) Is it all right?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Only question of custom and habit too. For our side “position” and
                        “views” are …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. Let's leave
                        it. It's just stylistic.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Because if we delete it there appears a question of stylistic
                        matter … question for us Chinese. That is, “position” is a question of
                        matters of principle; “views” are specific things.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d93-04" facs="d93-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. I don't want
                        to be petty. I have one other stylistic question. If in the first sentence
                        we can take out the word “respective.” Keep it in the second sentence, but
                        take it out of the first. Just say, “They presented their views . . “ Purely
                        stylistic. In English it isn't good if exactly the same words are at the end
                        of two successive sentences.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We agree. There is no substantive matter involved here at all. It
                        is a matter of style. We suggest that for us in Chinese we keep respective,
                        but if you delete it …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Pure question of style.
                        No one will notice it. It would be helpful… what we would like to say when
                        this is finished is that this is an unusual communique. We talked frankly
                        and stated our differences frankly, and therefore a little eloquence at the
                        beginning is helpful. So this is fine.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Go on to another paragraph. That is on the second sentence of the
                        second paragraph, 'The Chinese said that where there is oppression there is
                        resistance.” Then the second sentence to that paragraph, we have another
                        suggestion, and think you will realize why. That is to say, we would like to
                        restore the original wording. Why do I say this? Because you know in my
                        speech in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly that's what
                        I said, and that's why I said you would anticipate that I would make this
                        suggestion. I would like to make here a brief explanation of why we are
                        making this suggestion again.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have noticed that the
                        Vice Foreign Minister didn't waste any of the language from my previous
                        visit. Whatever was eliminated here he put in his speech. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Please, go ahead.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: As you say, first of all, that is, of course, that our positions
                        and philosophies are different on many questions. As for this specific
                        wording, “revolution”, you on your side use it on many occasions too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't have your
                        reputation.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d93-05" facs="d93-05"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in one
                        of his well-known articles mentioned this question. You are more familiar
                        with these words than I. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> once said these changes in India are a “revolution.”
                        That was in 1967, and then in the intervening period there were many such
                        examples when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        mentioned “revolution.” And then one of the latest references of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to the word “revolution”
                        was in an interview granted to TIME Magazine in January, 1972. The gist of
                        this was President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> replied to a
                        question that there is a new American Revolution.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but we apply it to
                        ourselves, not to other countries. We don't object to your saying, “the
                        Chinese revolution.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But in President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                        article of 1967, he mentioned the revolution in Asia. Our socialist
                        revolution has a history of only 20 years and more, whereas your country has
                        200 years. Both our nations are the sons of revolution, so why can't we
                        mention it? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have
                        two problems. One, as the Foreign Minister remembers, we did not
                        unqualifiedly approve his speech at the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: 'Empty cannons.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Second, which is more
                        important, as I explained to the Prime Minister last time, when you make
                        this statement as your own it is very logical. When you make it in a
                        document that includes the President of the United States, we have to think
                        how it will be greeted at home. Did he come this far only for the Chinese to
                        use him as the instrument of their propaganda? I am being very frank with
                        you, but I understand your use of a different word.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The fact that there does exist differences between our two
                        countries is known through the whole world, and we have no intention of
                        covering these differences up. But if there does arise some criticism of the
                        nature you mentioned a moment ago—making use of this visit to make
                        propaganda for ourselves—on the Chinese side we are faced with the same
                        question. Just before you state your views and people can also criticize us
                        that you are using this occasion only to state your views. And I am being
                        very frank here and particularly think our <pb n="6" xml:id="d93-06" facs="d93-06"/>American friends understand our practice. That is, it is
                        our view to put forward our views as they really are, as an expression of
                        honesty, whether it be to our friends or to the people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let us do this, because
                        we have more or less agreed on this. Let us put the word in tentatively. I
                        will have to speak to the President—and see how the rest of it looks. If the
                        rest of the document is agreeable, when I think we can probably live with
                        this word. I will submit it to the President.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I agree. And then about the Chinese statement on Indochina, there
                        is a phrase which we would like to add, merely a question of a factual
                        matter. That is to add this phrase: “The Chinese side expressed its firm
                        support to the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in their efforts”
                        through “of the Republic of South Vietnam.” Then add “its elaboration of
                        February of the two key problems in the seven-point proposal.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of February?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You might as well put
                        in February. Otherwise, no one in America will know what you are talking
                        about. That's fair enough; all right, that's proper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Of February this year?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of February this year
                        if you want it.</p>
                    <p>How many pages is the transcript of our discussions in Chinese?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Our efficiency is not as high as yours. By 48 hours after we can
                        answer that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's not important.</p>
                    <p>This change is fine, but for my own edification, why do you support seven
                        points when the North Vietnamese told us they wanted to negotiate nine
                        points? I don't understand the North Vietnamese and I don't understand you.
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="d93-07" facs="d93-07"/>I was prepared to negotiate…
                        but I don't understand why we are being pressed to accept points which Hanoi
                        itself didn't want to discuss with us.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I am not familiar with the specific proceedings of these
                        negotiations, so I am not in a position to answer. And then I would like to
                        ask you a question, very honest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, this is not
                        negotiating, just to try to understand each other.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We are only exchanging views and the question of Vietnam can only
                        be solved by you. On the visit of Mr. President, the whole spirit of his
                        visit is to relax tension.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So we would like to ask what really are your intentions about this
                        Vietnam question? The President exchanged views with the Prime Minister on
                        this matter, but as we see it your way is not a way out of this question.
                        Because in the Far East the really acute question is the Indochina
                        question.</p>
                    <p>As for the Taiwan question, we have very big differences, but there is no
                        particular tension involved because there is no fighting there now. And as
                        you want to relax the tension in the Far East the principal question is that
                        of Vietnam. I am, of course, quite aware of all the points made by Mr.
                        President in his exchange of views with our Prime Minister, as well as your
                        statements on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would like to do this
                        privately because it is a crucial issue, and we are attempting to approach
                        it on a basis that is just to both sides. But I think to do it thoughtfully
                        would take us an hour, and I would like to propose to the Vice Foreign
                        Minister, if he agreed, that we schedule a separate meeting for it after we
                        have worked on the communique on a very private basis which would remain
                        totally secret. I don't want to repeat just our formal position now—if you
                        want to do it, we will. But I think it is better to get your views on the
                        communique first, and then schedule a meeting tomorrow or tonight for the
                        question of Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d93-08" facs="d93-08"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I agree. Either tonight or some time tomorrow. We will find time
                        for that. Or any other time. We will find the time for it. Completely
                        informal basis.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Completely informal,
                        and we will never mention it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So, let's go on to our communique.</p>
                    <p>That is concerning Chinese statement on the India-Pakistan question, we plan
                        to have this wording revised.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No other changes in
                        that paragraph?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No. The Prime Minister had already expressed some ideas along this
                        line to the President yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is to say, to put it this way, “it firmly maintains that
                        India and Pakistan should, in accordance with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on the India-Pakistan question, immediately
                        withdraw all their troops to their own side of the borders and of the
                        ceasefire line in Kashmir and firmly supports the Pakistani government and
                        people in their struggle to preserve their independence and sovereignty, and
                        the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their struggle for the right of
                        self-determination.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't think Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> will be happy with you.
                        (laughter)</p>
                    <p>I give you this confidential information. We have no objection to whatever
                        you wish to say on this.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: As for your working of this, you told us last time about the
                        general thinking you have on this matter, but not specific wording.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have some vague
                        wording which we have not yet discussed with the President in detail, and
                        therefore we can modify it, but I will informally give it to you. I think
                        for example we can also support the withdrawal of both sides to the
                        ceasefire line. It isn't in here.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We have no specific objections at this moment to this wording. It
                        depends on you, really.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d93-09" facs="d93-09"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We'll keep it
                        tentatively, and will you give us an English translation of yours? We have
                        no objection to your wording. It may strengthen it to say “it favors …”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We would like to repeat our suggestion about this withdrawal
                        because it involves two aspects: one is withdrawal to their own side of the
                        borders. The other is to withdraw to the ceasefire line.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I hadn't heard that.
                        Let me study your text, but otherwise we have no objection to your text.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: We will give Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> the Chinese version.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He is so sympathetic
                        with the Chinese I thought he might be in collusion with Mr.
                            <persName>Chang</persName>.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: From the third page to the fourth page, that is your
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We have no objections to your suggested changes in the tenses.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thank you. I have a
                        suggestion. We would like … when I was here in October we didn't have a
                        formal proposal that would be made public and therefore, since you have
                        referred to the seven-point proposal, I would like to refer to our
                        eight-point proposal.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That's the right of having differences.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right. I will
                        give you the exact phrase when we meet again. ”… and stated that its
                        eight-point proposal of January 25 represents a just basis for the
                        attainment of that objective.” Something like this.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: There is no need to repeat our views on your eight-point
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, no, we know it. You
                        are supporting seven points. We are not commenting on each other's
                        positions. It's simply an objective statement of our views.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d93-10" facs="d93-10"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So then we go on to page 4.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We may not settle the
                        war in Vietnam, but we will confuse everyone so completely … . There are
                        seven points, eight points, secret nine points, two explanations of the
                        seven points. You have to be a Talmudic scholar to understand it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Our communique will not increase the knowledge of the peoples. As
                        you said, if the word “revolution” was put in to make propaganda, saying
                        support the seven-point proposal is also making propaganda. These are our
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Once Governor Harriman
                        said our point six is why they can't accept our proposal. But our point six
                        is almost word-for-word their point seven. We thought we were making a big
                        concession with it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: What did Governor Harriman think after they were published? I am
                        well acquainted with him.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He is now …</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Still very active?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, yes. He is still
                        the unofficial ambassador of the Soviet Union. He thinks we are very wrong
                        to antagonize the Soviet Union so much.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I would like to remind you of the fact that the secret clauses of
                        the World War II agreements on China were drafted by Averell Harriman as the
                        People's Republic's representative. I am unclear as to what it has to do
                        with history.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On Vietnam he is closer
                        to your position than to ours, but in his general philosophy he feels we are
                        going too far in the direction of the People's Republic.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Let's continue. So on these paragraphs we have no differences.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We agree on our
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We agree to disagree. Now we are on page 5.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d93-11" facs="d93-11"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The rest of 4 is all
                        right.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Except for the change of tenses.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but with the
                        second paragraph on page 4 you have no problem.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, page 5.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: On the second paragraph of page 5. Originally, it was written “it
                        would be against the interests of the people of the world for any major
                        country to collude with another … or to behave in such a way as to suggest
                        it had an exclusive sphere of interest.” In our suggestion, the first phrase
                        remains unchanged. Then, ”… or to divide up spheres of interest.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One country can't
                        divide up spheres of interest. I'm just putting it in English. ”… or to
                        claim exclusive spheres of interest.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I would like to quite frankly say why we make this suggestion. We
                        find there are shortcomings in the version you just suggested though in
                        substance there may be no difference. We know that whether it be exclusive
                        domination by one country or condominium, we are opposed to that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But frankly speaking, to us your present wording connotes the
                        question of enjoying equal rights, which has some implications of what
                        happened before in China's history.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your
                        problem. What you want to say, I am thinking out loud, is something like, ”…
                        or for the major countries to divide up the world into exclusive spheres of
                        influence.” What you want to say is it is wrong for countries to divide up
                        the world. Isn't that right?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: What I mean is we are opposed to both tendencies. One is for a
                        country to exercise exclusive domination over an exclusive sphere of
                        interest. Another is for a number of countries to collude with each
                        other.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d93-12" facs="d93-12"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. Give me
                        your text again. I am not quarrelling with what you are trying to do. I
                        understand it and agree with it. It's only a question now of finding the
                        word. Then that phrase would be “or to divide up spheres of interest.” It
                        doesn't sound right in English. How about, “or for the major countries to
                        divide up the world into exclusive spheres of interest.” It sounds wrong in
                        English. The way it reads now is “it is against the interests …” through
                        “against other countries.” One country can't divide up the world, you see
                        what I mean?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Would you kindly give us a written version of that? Just hearing
                        it we find nothing to object to.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At any rate we agree on
                        what we are trying to say, so it is purely a stylistic problem. I will give
                        you a text this afternoon. This is easy, because we agree with what you want
                        to say.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So that will be that. And then we come to the common ground of the
                        two sides. On page 5, “with these principles of international relations in
                        mind …” That is all right. Then “progress toward the normalization of
                        relations” through “is in the interest of all countries.” That is all right.
                        And then the second point, we agreed to the original wording and not to your
                        addition. It had already been mentioned above, and it is rather unclear here
                        and redundant.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's not unclear, but
                        it is redundant.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It is not that. It is the question of whether there are disputes
                        between China and the United States but the two types of disputes, within
                        the country itself and international, and as to how international disputes
                        should be solved we already mentioned that in the ppreceding paragraph. So
                        if you are to add this phrase it is not only redundancy but ambiguity.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This was not the
                        intention.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We understand that was not your intention, but it is also a
                        question of redundancy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are glad to add the
                        phrase “international” here—it has a way of highlighting it.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d93-13" facs="d93-13"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Read the ppreceding paragraph again.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me ask you this: We
                        will be able, on the basis of the preceding paragraph to say to the press
                        that on international disputes we have renounced the use of force. Then on
                        Taiwan I would say China does not consider Taiwan an international
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So there is no need to add this phrase here.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But is it all right if
                        we explain the meaning of the communique in this sense afterward—can we say
                        after we get back that one of the results of our trip was that we have
                        renounced the use of force in our disputes with one another? Then we will
                        say—we will not embarrass you—that you do not consider Taiwan an
                        international dispute. We will not be tricky on this.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Our position on the Taiwan question we have stated on many
                        occasions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. We will
                        not apply it to the Taiwan question. We know your position—you have stated
                        it since 1955, and we will not use this communique as a way of making you
                        change your position on this.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We have always considered that the Taiwan question had two
                        aspects. One is your military presence, which we should try to solve through
                        negotiations, whereas the question with Chiang Kai-shek is a domestic
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let us drop this then.
                        The President may want to raise it again. One suggestion—at the top of the
                        page, why don't we say, “will apply these principles …” and we will drop
                        this other sentence the way we proposed it.</p>
                    <p>On the top of page 5 should we substitute “will” for “are prepared toy?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We would prefer to leave it “are prepared”—if it is changed to
                        “will” it will involve the Taiwan question. It might imply that you should
                        immediately withdraw from Taiwan. This is from our point of view. So when we
                        say “are prepared” we take into consideration the state of affairs in which
                        we find ourselves at present. What do you think?</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d93-14" facs="d93-14"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I consider
                        this?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And then that means that you previously agreed to delete . .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I would like to
                        discuss it with the President.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Surely, we understand that; “neither will seek”. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's fine.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And now we come to the crucial question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I make a
                        suggestion? Since I think that will take the longest time, shall we do all
                        the rest first and then come back to the crucial question?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The following is a rather important question, that is the sentence
                        on trade and also on other bilateral relations. But that is all connected
                        with this crucial question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. We will have
                        to do it one way or the other. No problem. Go ahead. We will follow your
                        suggestion.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: On this crucial question we should at any rate advance a step
                        forward to make a new beginning. We were joking yesterday when you said you
                        expected I would agree very rapidly to your suggestion—but I have rapidly
                        disagreed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It shows what a bad
                        judge I am.</p>
                    <p>VM Chi iao: Now I would like to comment on your suggestion. And I hope you
                        will not interpret my frank exposition as anything else. According to our
                        discussions last time I do understand your wishes and on our side, too, we
                        hope we can approach each other closely. But frankly speaking, from this
                        formulation you put forward yesterday there has been not only no advance,
                        but in a certain aspect a step backward.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which aspect?</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d93-15" facs="d93-15"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: For instance, in October our two sides had already agreed to the
                        first portion of this statement. It was agreed at that time to these two
                        sentences: “The U.S. side declared that the U.S. acknowledges” through “the
                        United States does not challenge that position.” But here you put in a
                        different formulation. Originally you agreed to say Taiwan is a province of
                        China, whereas in yesterday's formulation you said “Taiwan historically has
                        been Chinese territory.” And we don't approve of that formulation because
                        the fact is really that all Chinese on either side of the Straits maintain
                        that there is but one China.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me hear the rest of
                        your comments. I will reply to them all together.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: As the Premier told the President yesterday, if there is still any
                        common point of view between those of us on the two sides of the Taiwan
                        Straits, it is that Taiwan is a province of China. And so as that is
                        something maintained by all Chinese and something which you put forward
                        yourself last time …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You put it forward.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: … which you agreed to last time, but now for you to say Taiwan has
                        historically been Chinese territory, that is a step backward.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's hear the rest of
                        your comments. I understand your point.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: On that portion which, we have not agreed to we cannot accept that
                        version put forward by you. That is, the last time you said you agreed to
                        say that “it hopes.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Abiding concern.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “Abiding interest.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We took that out.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But now you use the words “reaffirms its position.” We think that
                        is too strong. And I would like to say also that this is different from <pb n="16" xml:id="d93-16" facs="d93-16"/>what you had publicly stated. For
                        instance, in the World Message put forward by your President he said these
                        words, “The ultimate relationship between Taiwan and the Mainland is not a
                        matter for the United States to decide. A peaceful resolution of this
                        problem by the two parties would do much to reduce tension in the Far East…
                        We are not, however, urging either party to follow any particular course.”
                        But when you use the word “position” it means you have in mind that we
                        Chinese should follow a particular course. So we said that even proceeding
                        from your openly published stand, we cannot agree with it because it is not
                        consistent.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are not asked to
                        agree to this. This is our position. We are pursuing an unusual course here
                        anyway. We have no comment on what you are saying about Taiwan, but here, in
                        effect, you are commenting on what we are saying. We are not saying that you
                        have to agree to this. VM Ch'iao: No, this is a matter between us because
                        Taiwan is our territory.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: If there was no difference between us on this matter we would not
                        be sitting here discussing it. So I think it would be better to change the
                        word “position” to the word “hope.” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me find another solution.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is my second objection. And then the third point. ”… should
                        be achieved …” This is something like a command. “Should” do this, “should”
                        do that. You put us in an awkward position—embarrassing us. So these are the
                        points of objection, and we have frankly told you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate this.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But, as I said at the beginning, I do understand that your
                        subjective wish is by your formulation to bring the two sides closer.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is. We know you are
                        intelligent enough that we can't do anything tricky, and even if we could we
                        would have to live with it for a long time. So the spirit is to bring us
                        closer together.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I have no intention of thinking that either of our sides want to
                        play any tricks.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d93-17" facs="d93-17"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The question is that there are differences of view between our two
                        sides. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Actually there
                        are fewer differences in practice than there are in expression.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Even if it's only a question of expression, you have your
                        difficulties and we have our difficulties, and the Chinese people feel very
                        strongly on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So after considering various aspects, we have suggested a
                        formulation. Now this will be our suggested formulation. The first two
                        sentences remain as in October: “The U.S. side … and that Taiwan is a
                        province of China. The U.S. Government does not challenge that position. It
                        hopes that the Taiwan question will be settled by the Chinese themselves
                        through peaceful negotiations.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You will hand me
                        that?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And then the final sentence. It states that “it will progressively
                        reduce and finally withdraw all the U.S. troops and military installations
                        from Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our difficulty, Mr.
                        Vice Minister, is that it is our belief for us to return to be attacked that
                        we sold out a friend in the capital of another country with which we have
                        had long difficulties will unleash a storm, and will undo much of the good
                        that has been accomplished and will reduce our ability to do what we have
                        said we will do. This is complicated by the fact that this is an election
                        year, and therefore it makes the problem especially complex for us as to
                        what we can say. I speak to the Vice Foreign Minister very frankly.</p>
                    <p>To give you an example, Mr. Vice Minister, and to explain to you why we
                        changed that first sentence, I took the formulation brought by General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> before I came here to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>. I did this
                        because he is the strong man in our cabinet, and we need him if we want to
                        get public support for something; or, it is helpful—we don't need him
                        absolutely, but it is <pb n="18" xml:id="d93-18" facs="d93-18"/>helpful. He
                        doesn't know anything about China, Taiwan—he's just an American who has
                        instinctive reactions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Strong reactions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He said to me, “You've
                        sold out.” This is the Haig formulation. Because he thought that the phrase
                        “a province of China” has a peculiar connotation in America. He said he
                        thought this meant we were turning over Taiwan to China right then and
                        there. I am not arguing the merit of the position; I am trying to tell you
                        what we are up against and I know how painful this is for you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But why didn't you tell him <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> too says Taiwan is a province of China?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Vice Minister, I
                        have explained this to him. His argument is you never have a chance to
                        explain these things after all hell has broken loose. This is almost a
                        direct quotation. I just want to explain to you there is no complicated
                        rationale. We want to avoid the word “province”—and we are trying to gain
                        his support which could be useful.</p>
                    <p>On the middle part, I thought I was meeting you some part of the way by
                        taking out the words “abiding interest.” But I have an idea of how to fix
                        this and will skip it for the moment.</p>
                    <p>Now we come to the last part. The dilemma we face is this. You do not wish us
                        to state it conditionally, because you took the position this is your
                        territory and we have no right to set conditions, and I understand this. We
                        would like to find a formulation which is at least vaguer, not because it
                        affects what we will do, which you know, but because it enables us to return
                        without looking as if we had surrendered on this point. And this is our
                        dilemma with your last sentence.</p>
                    <p>We have told you exactly what we will do and we have kept all our promises. I
                        have repeated it on each of my visits. The President has repeated it. So I
                        have an idea of what to do with the central part; I have no precise idea yet
                        on what to do with the last sentence. What I would like to do if this <pb n="19" xml:id="d93-19" facs="d93-19"/>meets the approval of the Minister
                        is that after we finish here, I would like to spend an hour with my
                        assistants and talk to the President and give you another draft early this
                        afternoon, which you can study, which takes into account your points and, of
                        course, I will show the President your version also. But I simply wanted to
                        give you my reaction.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I am very grateful for your comments. But you know that in the
                        Chinese declaration on this matter there are many points which we could
                        have, but did not put forward. For instance, in your propaganda you have
                        repeatedly stated you abide by your treaty commitments with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. But we took into account
                        your situation. We did not fire some empty cannons, for instance, that you
                        must immediately totally and unconditionally withdraw from Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Like your allies.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You have heard that. We say direction, but the direction must be
                        mentioned. You mentioned in one of your past declarations the ultimate
                        objective of the withdrawal. But if such formulations are to be put forward,
                        it would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Ultimate objective”
                        you would not agree to.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I just say that in your last suggestion in October you still
                        mentioned “ultimate objective” but in this draft which you put forward you
                        don't even mention that—you just talk about progressive removal. So when
                        your people see it they will say, “Isn't that the same as in Vietnam?”, and
                        you will leave a tail behind. Reduction, but not withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Removal” in English
                        means “withdrawal.” “Progressive” means it will be done in stages.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Well, we have already stated our views and in a frank and serious
                        way, and have repeatedly studied formulations we put forward, and in our
                        formulation we put full stops at ends of sentences. They are independent
                        sentences. You have semicolons; we have full stops. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The difficulty is that you are
                        so much subtler than most Americans that that fine point will be totally
                        lost on most Americans. But I appreciate it.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="d93-20" facs="d93-20"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Taiwan is our territory. That's our problem, not your problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your
                        problem, and I am not saying you are being unreasonable. We have an
                        objective difficulty here because it does you no good if, as the result of
                        the communique, a tremendous debate starts in the U.S. about whether we were
                        completely taken in by you and casts into doubt everything else that we have
                        discussed. That is the problem we face.</p>
                    <p>And, for example, there is the other problem. I recognize you are not
                        mentioning the defense treaty on your side, but I do not think it will help
                        you when we are asked by Congress what this means that we point out that you
                        have not mentioned the defense treaty, because that would be embarrassing to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It won't be embarrassing because we would immediately put it off,
                        the differences.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's what I mean,
                        exactly.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I just say that in these private conversations to take into
                        consideration your problems.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will not mention it
                        to the Congress, I promise you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Because the fact that we are not mentioning this treaty is to take
                        into consideration your difficulties. Our American friends should
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: 'We here understand it.
                        Our problem is we cannot explain this to our people that the Chinese side
                        has taken our problems into account by not mentioning the defense treaty
                        because that would make it worse. And therefore, we will be judged only by
                        these words, and we cannot explain your moderation, because that would not
                        help matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Well, you need not say that in your
                        explanations to your contacts. Just ask them to make a comparison between
                        this statement and <pb n="21" xml:id="d93-21" facs="d93-21"/>the Vice
                        Minister's statement in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and they will
                        see what moderation we have exercised.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: If this wording you put forward is to be published, then to put it
                        in customary Chinese wording our people would explode. They will say what
                        have you been doing in these talks? I agree to this suggestion—this is a
                        crucial matter and suppose we continue with your suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will give you
                        another draft this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And so to put it very frankly, if we cannot find the wording
                        acceptable to both sides, and reasonable on this crucial matter, then on the
                        other matter of trade or exchanges we cannot find it possible to go on to
                        discuss these things.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: If you find any of my comments not clear we can have more
                        exchanges now because we do have differences. Or shall we recess now? Our
                        differences are to be discussed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think I understand
                        your point of view and don't think much is solved by continuing this
                        discussion until we have considered it and then we can do. Because we don't
                        want to draft something here of this importance. But can we consider for a
                        moment what will happen if we cannot find a mutually agreeable formulation?
                        How shall we then proceed?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It will be hard for us to reply to that. Maybe just no
                        communique?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's a
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>Well, the next step has to be that we consider. We shouldn't plan for
                        something that we are here to avoid.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is right. We are very serious about this communique.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know you are.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Because we Chinese don't take things very lightly.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d93-22" facs="d93-22"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This has been our
                        experience, and we will consider what you have said and make an effort to
                        meet your concerns. And you please keep in mind our difficulties and that we
                        are approaching it in a very serious manner also and with the intention of
                        having a positive outcome.</p>
                    <p>I want to make one point about exchanges and trade. Precisely because we are
                        serious people we both know that basically they don't mean anything. The
                        maximum amount of bilateral trade possible between us, even if we make great
                        efforts, is infinitesimal in terms of our total economy. And the exchanges,
                        while they are important, will not change objective realities. We both know
                        this. Nevertheless, we believe that we should have some significant
                        paragraphs in the communique on this because what we are doing is to make a
                        revolution in American foreign policy, and we need to symbolize it in some
                        concrete way that the American people can understand. When I say
                        “revolution” there is a great deal of sentimental interest in China. But in
                        terms of the hard decisions that we have to take, such as we did take in the
                        crisis with the Subcontinent, such as we did take in relations with the
                        Soviet Union and Japan, where a concrete price has to be paid, we wouldn't
                        have nearly the support that you would think we have watching television
                        people. In other words, you no doubt distinguish between the sentimentality
                        and reality of Americans in their attitudes toward China, especially those
                        with a missionary background. Many of those, a majority of those who are
                        genuinely in favor of better relations with China, would be absolutely
                        horrified if they knew about the discussion we had yesterday morning.</p>
                    <p>So I want to tell you the attitude of the President and myself on exchanges
                        and trade. We believe that a people who has suffered and fought what you
                        have in the last 50 years, who have been on the Long March are not going to
                        be charmed by a group of pedants from universities or bought by a
                        businessman from Hong Kong. But the American public is more sentimental and
                        also there will be inevitable comparisons between what will happen when we
                        go to Moscow, and I have explained what the Soviet strategy is —to get a
                        maximum number of agreements, no matter how irrelevant they are. I say this
                        only so there is no misunderstanding about exchanges and trade, and why we
                        want it.</p>
                    <p>Can I raise a few minor technical points, or should we wait? They are not
                        connected with the communique.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, you may.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="d93-23" facs="d93-23"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: I would like to say one more word on the
                        Taiwan clause. That is on the first part, these first two sentences were
                        already agreed upon, and what is more, the State Department in Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' memo to the President, it
                        too agrees that Taiwan is a province of China. Does Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> still think it is necessary to
                        change the wording?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me talk to the
                        President about it. We will try to deal with it in a positive spirit.</p>
                    <p>We are going to replace General Walters in Paris. He is going to be made
                        Deputy Director of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. That is always a
                        job that goes to a military man, and we are giving it to him because we
                        trust him. He will leave Paris. We are thinking of asking our Ambassador in
                        Paris to carry these messages. This is not a career ambassador. He is a
                        personal friend of the President's and we have complete confidence in him.
                        And he would do it privately. He would not do it on an official basis and
                        the secrecy would be maintained. Is that agreeable to you? You don't have to
                        answer now.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Thank you for your notification.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it agreeable or you
                        will let me know?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We will tell you later.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If not, we will find
                        somebody else. We are being pressed very much by our press to tell them
                        something. So far we have said nothing and will say nothing of substance,
                        but is it possible to say, for example, when the President and the Prime
                        Minister meet they speak without notes, just to give them atmosphere? It's
                        stupid. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You are expert on this matter; I am not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am an expert on
                        stupidity?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: On making these people stupid.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On making the press
                        stupid?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You must not make that public to them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought I would quote
                        you.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="d93-24" facs="d93-24"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: There is nothing substantial about that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we say that the
                        atmosphere is frank, friendly, or whatever, about the mood?</p>
                    <p>Let's wait till we have the Taiwan thing settled. I think it's better.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Use “frank” and “serious.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's not use
                        adjectives. We once drafted an all-purpose communique: “The fact that voices
                        were raised does not prove that physical violence was used.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Can we say something like that?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I don't know how you'll put it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We could say the table
                        between them prevented physical violence.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Of course, you say that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be helpful if
                        either the Prime Minister to the President, or you to me would say … the
                        President suggested to the Prime Minister for me to visit after the Moscow
                        summit. It has to be before July 7 because that is the Democratic
                        Convention. It would help if some comment could be made because it would
                        help in our bureaucracy to know these arrangements were made as a result of
                        this visit.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Certainly, we will give you a clear reply to that before you
                        leave.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No hurry. One other
                        point. The Director of the New York Museum of Art was under the impression
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> said to him
                        you might consider sending some of the works of art going to the Paris
                        museum to the United States if our government welcomed this. I don't know
                        whether he misunderstood Chinese politeness. I give you this letter from
                        him. You should reply to him, not to us. If you are considering it, and if
                        our interest is of importance, we would welcome it, but we are not
                        requesting it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It's very clear. We will study this.</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="d93-25" facs="d93-25"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and the answer
                        should go to him, not to us. You can tell us if you want to, but I want to
                        make clear it is a non-governmental proposal.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, you made that very clear. But on the question of informing of
                        these things, we can tell you when we make our decision.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would be very
                        pleased.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But it is not a governmental action.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When shall we meet
                        again, this afternoon?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The President and Prime Minister are going to meet again this
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At 5:00.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So long as it does not affect discussions between the President
                        and the Premier we can meet again. You can inform us of the time. So long as
                        it does not affect the meeting between Prime Minister and President, any
                        other time is all right for us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After a dinner of
                        Peking duck I will agree to anything.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I hope so. Would you kindly tell us the name of your ambassador in
                        Paris?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Watson. He is not as
                        intelligent as Walters.</p>
                    <p>Let us aim for 3:00 this afternoon, or 3:30. Let's say 3:30. It won't take us
                        long because if we have a new text we will give it to you and explain
                        it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Decide on 3:30.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I would be prepared
                        to meet after the Peking duck, either to get your reaction to what we
                        discussed at 3:30 or to discuss Vietnam. Or tomorrow—it's up to you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Let us put the communique in first priority. We'll be flexible.
                        Mr. HAN Hsu's principle is flexibility.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have noticed
                        that.</p>

                    <p>At our suggestion, the Foreign minister opened with a review of the
                        international situation from the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> point
                        of view, which, he observed, can be learned from <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> newspapers.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> noted first that great changes had
                        occurred in the international situation in the over 20 years since the end
                        of World War II, changes to which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had referred in his Foreign Policy Report of July 6,
                        1971. The most dominant characteristic of the world in this period is its
                        untranquil nature. Although there has been no new world war, local wars have
                        never ceased. The civil conflict in China, the Korean War and the Viet-Nam
                        war are examples. Now the India-Pakistan war has added a third war in this
                        area, sharpening contradictions and making the situation in South Asia more
                        unstable and uncertain. The Middle East is in the midst of recurrent war
                        crises, with the ever-present possibility of war on a larger scale.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Causes of Turmoil</p>
                    <p>What are the causes of this lack of tranquility? Frankly speaking, they
                        cannot be separated from the post World War II policies of Presidents
                        Truman, <persName>Kennedy</persName> and <persName>Johnson</persName>. Thus,
                        in the 1950's the economic and military strengths of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> expanded enormously. In the words of the 1971
                        Foreign Policy Report, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had
                        “indisputable superiority in strategic strength.” As a result the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> stretched out its hands too far and attempted
                        to gain too much control. Tension grew in many areas as a result. Witness
                        the civil war in China, the Korean War and Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the 1960's, another big power has attempted to slip into your shoes and to
                        control the affairs of other countries. It wants to intervene in Europe, the
                        Middle East, the Mediterranean and also in South Asia. Its purpose is to
                        establish hegemony in the Indian Ocean and to dominate everyone else, as the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Foreign Policy Report noted. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has noted also that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        relations are “dominated by incessant and dangerous conflict.” Thus, how can
                        the international situation be other than dangerous? Furthermore, the
                        situation will become increasingly hostile.</p>

                    <p>What was the result of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy to
                        dominate all, the Foreign Minister asked. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> himself noted in the July 1971
                        Foreign Policy Report that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was no
                        longer in a position of “complete predominance” and “has a challenge such as
                        we did not even dream of.” Mr. Secretary is no doubt familiar with our views
                        that where there is oppression there will be resistance. President Truman
                        spent billions to engage in the Chinese civil war, but what was the result?
                        We are all clear about that and no details are needed. Then you began
                        throwing more billions as well as your own troops into the Indochinese War,
                        bringing disaster to the people of Indochina. Now it is certain that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will not be able to win this war.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Crux of the World Situation</p>
                    <p>The crux of the situation in the world is that aggression and oppression are
                        unpopular and can only arouse the resistance of the people. (The Foreign
                        Minister then drew a parallel with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> war
                        of independence.)</p>
                    <p>In the view of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, despite upheavals,
                        the trend is progressive, and is reflected in the post-war antiimperialist
                        and anti-colonialist struggles in Asia which have brought independence to
                        many countries. In Africa and Latin America the struggle against colonialism
                        and imperialism has spread and countries are becoming independent one after
                        another. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also has
                        noted the strong desire for change in Latin America.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Competition of the “Super Powers”</p>
                    <p>In the world today, the Foreign Minister continued, there are one or two
                        super-powers who, no matter how wild their ambitions, cannot monopolize
                        world affairs. The middle and smaller powers demand a voice. This trend is
                        being expressed in international bodies like the U.N. Our outlook is
                        optimistic: countries want independence; nations want liberation; and people
                        want revolution. This is an irresistible trend.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d94-04" facs="d94-04"/>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has said that he wants
                        a relaxation of international tension. But the people of the world see that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are rivals for world hegemony; anxious to divide between
                        themselves spheres of influence; and deeply involved in a nuclear arms race,
                        in what you call “global strategic competition.” You emphasize the need to
                        enhance your position of strength, to create an “adequate nuclear deterrent”
                        and to spend billions for this. How can this be conducive to peace and to
                        relaxation of tensions? It is already many years since the end of World War
                        II, but the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> still maintains many troops
                        and bass overseas.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and its “Old Friends,” or a New
                        Policy</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> says that it will not abandon its old
                        friends and will faithfully observe its treaty commitments. What does this
                        mean in fact? In fact, you have no intention of withdrawing troops from
                        overseas, or of giving up control over and interference in other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>How then can the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> contribute to a relaxation
                        of tensions? Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> told
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> last October that “if
                        we are to enter a new era, it will be necessary to change some relations, If
                        there is no change, then life can only go on as before.”</p>
                    <p>If you maintain all old relations, you won't “abandon old friends;” how can
                        you adapt to a new era? I discussed this problem with the Secretary on our
                        trip to the Great Wall. What about <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Ding
                            Diem</persName> and Syngman Rhee? Were they not “old friends” in their
                        time? It is clear to everyone what end they met. Why are you so reluctant to
                        part with unpopular “old friends.” In our view we must march forward to
                        adapt to a new era. We cannot stand still.</p>

                        International Relations</p>
                    <p>If we are to ease international tension and attain peace then all must
                        respect the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Every country must be
                        free to choose its own social system without outside interference. Otherwise
                        the world will only see even greater upheavals.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d94-05" facs="d94-05"/>
                    <p>For over a century the Foreign Minister continued, the Chinese people have
                        suffered from foreign aggression and oppression. Therefore, the Chinese
                        people of course sympathize with and firmly support the just struggle of all
                        oppressed peoples. I think you know that our support is primarily political
                        and moral although we give some material support to friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the five principles, we have established and developed
                        relations of friendship and cooperation with many countries. Even with these
                        countries with whom we have differences of principle, we have established
                        normal relations on the basis of the five principles. The old China once
                        bullied neighbor countries, and then itself was subjected to bullying. This
                        kind of injustice still exists today with the large bullying the small and
                        the strong bullying the weak. Our experience has shown that big power
                        chauvinism is undesirable. All countries, large and small, should be equal.
                        International matters should be settled by consultation of all countries and
                        not by the super-powers. We believe that peaceful consultation should be
                        used to settle problems and not force or the threat of force. Troops should
                        be withdrawn from foreign territory.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects for Peace in Asia</p>
                    <p>While we favor a reduction of tension in the Far East, we take a realistic
                        view of the complicated situation in that area. We hope for peace but we
                        have no illusions about the ease with which peace may be attained. We hope
                        for a reduction of tensions, but we are not afraid of tension. We are
                        accustomed to tension on our borders. In fact, tensions are not harmful to
                        us, but rather have the effect of educating and mobilizing our people.</p>
                    <p>I must tell you frankly that we have made preparation against all kinds of
                        eventualities. I believe that you must be clear about all these.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> concluded this presentation by
                        suggesting that certain questions touched on only briefly, such as those
                        concerning Indochina, Japan and Korea, could be dealt with separately later
                        on.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d94-06" facs="d94-06"/>
                    <p>The Secretary opened by commenting that the Foreign minister's presentation
                        showed so many obvious misconceptions of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        policy and world affairs that he had difficulty knowing where to begin.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">”Oppression?”</p>
                    <p>It is difficult, he continued, for the American people to accept the PRO's
                        simplistic division of the world into oppressors and oppressed, into
                        aggressors and those aggressed against. It is also impossible, based on
                        observable fact, to imply that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is an
                        oppressor and thus unpopular in the world. That is a total fallacy. If one
                        travels extensively, as I have, one can see clearly that what you say is
                        entirely wrong, although isolation from the real world may cause some people
                        to think this way. I remarked to you on our way to the Great Wall that I
                        personally, as Secretary of State, have been well received in almost every
                        country I have visited, about 45 in all.</p>
                    <p>Our people are free to leave the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to go
                        anywhere they want. We have no problem of citizens who want to escape.
                        Rather, our problem is that we have so many people who want to come to the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> that we must have restrictions on
                        immigration. Many Chinese live in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and
                        more want to come. If the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was, as you seem
                        to imply, an “aggressor and oppressor,” then there would not be this
                        considerable desire to come to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has treaties with 45 nations. These
                        treaties, and the mutual commitments therein, were not forced on either
                        party. They were made with nations chosen by the people.</p>

                    <p>You are aware of our strong support for the independence of African nations.
                        I have been warmly received, in many of these countries. African nations do
                        not want revolution, but peaceful development and peaceful change are
                        needed. I was continually asked to provide more Americans and more <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> help to these countries.</p>

                    <p>The situation is much the same in Latin America where, as I learned at the
                        recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Americas, more <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> participation in development is desired. One
                        basic reason is that those countries know that we have no territorial

                    <p>I mentioned once in our meeting yesterday that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had been forced into world wars two times against our will.
                        We have since decided that we will never again be second best. And we do not
                        intend to apologize to anyone for that. We maintain our military strength as
                        a means to prevent another world war.</p>
                    <p>You imply that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops are in other
                        countries against the wishes of the people. This is not true. We maintain
                        troops in Europe in reaction to the threat to stability posed by the Warsaw
                        Pact and in response to the requests of the nations concerned. In fact, I
                        don't believe that your own government would want us to withdraw these
                        troops. Certainly the countries concerned do not want us to do so. The world
                        knows that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> power brought victory in World
                        War II; and that instead of dominating the vanquished we helped to rebuild

                        nation, Germany the fourth and Italy prospering.</p>
                    <p>In summation, I find that the facts simply do not support your implication

                        agreement with the Soviet Union reached through the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks. Would you want us to disarm unilaterally in the
                        kind of world we live in today?</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> expressed the hope that both the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will reduce arms levels. But the “self-defense” to which
                        you refer is different from our concept. Our self-defense is on our own
                        soil. But for you, self-defense includes the arms race between your two
                        countries. Suppose the Soviets refuse to reduce their armed strength, what
                        then?</p>
                    <p>Then we will maintain our strength, the Secretary replied. If we lived in an
                        idyllic world, then we would not need arms. Would you reduce your troops as
                        long as the Soviets are on your border?</p>
                    <p>If they don't attack us, we won't attack them, Foreign Minister
                            <persName>Chi</persName> replied.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Turmoil and Revolution in the World</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> stated that in spite of differences
                        in social system, philosophy, principles and outlook, it is still possible
                        to reach agreement on state relations. He commented that although the
                        Secretary said the people of the world do not want revolution, in the
                        Chinese view the world is in turmoil and that turmoil is good because then
                        everyone can have their say, and everyone can go forward.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that two years ago there was much turmoil in the Middle
                        East. Nigeria, once plagued by a most costly war, is now peaceful. Kenya is
                        vastly more stable than some ten to fifteen years ago.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that although in some areas war has ceased, in
                        others disruption and war is bound to break out. Portugal, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France are all supporting disruption and
                        subversion in Africa.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d94-10" facs="d94-10"/>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that France and England had been successful not only
                        in granting independence to their former colonies in Africa but in retaining
                        their friendship. The South African problem is another difficult problem and
                        we all understand that. With the exclusion of the Portuguese colonies, the
                        other nations of Africa have made significant progress. The last thing they
                        want now is revolution. They need more education, economic development and
                        technical assistance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Viet-Nam and Asia</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> commented that he had spoken
                        generally about “aggression and oppression” and that these words appeared to
                        have made the Secretary unhappy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was used to such words, and that if saying them
                        made the Foreign Minister feel better, he should go right ahead.</p>
                    <p>Where there is aggression, the Foreign Minister continued, there is
                        resistance to aggression and where there is oppression there is resistance
                        to oppression. After President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        came into office, he began to withdraw troops from Asia, but we must trace
                        out the roots of the problem. You inherited the problem and you are doing
                        your best to extricate yourself, but you must admit there was aggression and
                        oppression on your part. We know you are trying to settle the question of
                        Indochina.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he did not feel it useful to get into an
                        exchange of recriminations at this point, expressed appreciation for Chi's
                        comments on President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and said
                        that he thought it useful to remind ourselves that there have been recent
                        changes.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cambodia</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then raised the matter of North Vietnamese invasion of
                        Cambodian territory. At one time Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had complained publicly over the presence of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> troops on Cambodian soil, and had made
                        trips to Peking and Moscow in an attempt to get the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> to leave. To the American people this seemed like a clear
                        case of foreign troops in a country against the will of the people of that
                        country. The new government of Cambodia maintains exactly this same position
                        as <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> once did. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d94-11" facs="d94-11"/>would like to have Cambodia free
                        and neutral and to have f_oreign troops leave. We know your ideas are
                        different, although both <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> and
                        now the new government agree that the North Vietnamese are invaders. It is
                        difficult for us to understand why you feel differently. If the North
                        Vietnamese went back to North Viet-Nam, then there would be no trouble in
                        Cambodia. But it looks different from your point of view so these talks are
                        useful.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName>Chi</persName> replied that the Indochinese question
                        should be settled by the Indochinese peoples themselves.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> agreed and had
                        advocated an Indochinese conference. Foreign Minister
                            <persName>Chi</persName> refused to be drawn into a discussion of this,
                        stating only that “this is not our affair. We will not intervene.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Chi</persName> said that as mutual understanding
                        increases, reinforced by the “testimony of fact,” the views of both sides
                        will come together. It is important, the Foreign Minister said, if we cannot
                        find common views right away because we don't have to be in a hurry.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that there had been more agreement in principle than
                        he had anticipated and that the main differences lay in how to implement
                        principles and took the five principles of peaceful coexistence as an
                        example.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister concluded that relations between the two countries
                        should be concluded on the basis of these principles, in particular those
                        relating to non-interference in internal affairs and mutual respect for
                        territorial sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>Just before the meeting adjourned, a discussion arose over the meanings of
                        the words “dominance” and “predominance.” The Secretary pointed out that the
                        Foreign Minister had mistaken the term “predominance,” as used by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, for “dominance.” The
                        statement that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was predominant after
                        World War II simply meant that it was the strongest power in the world, not
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was trying to control the world.
                        Now, the President had pointed out, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        was no longer predominant, and that in our view, this was a natural and
                        healthy development.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am sorry I am late. I
                        was on the phone with Washington and I had to talk to the President. That is
                        why I am late.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Then the President's trip to
                        the Great Wall was fine.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He was delighted.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Such fine weather.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No one of our
                        associates knows about our discussions, and I will not show them to anybody
                        until we have agreed. I think you were right on your suggestion. What do you
                        think about letting me show the Secretary of State tonight after the dinner
                        the part up to the Taiwan section? That is the part we have agreed on. Tell
                        me candidly.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You want that we do our work
                        the best way possible. Maybe we will meet each other even before the
                        dinner.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d95-02" facs="d95-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We won't do anything
                        until—discuss it with me first. We have redrafted the statement, and we
                        tried to take your views into account. We have gone back practically to the
                        old terminology. The only thing we would like to say, which I think makes no
                        difference in Chinese, is there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of
                        China. It is just to avoid this criticism that I mentioned to you. I am just
                        explaining what we tried to do.</p>
                    <p>Then we have changed the word “position” to “view,” We have taken two
                        sentences from the World Report which you said you liked or at least maybe I
                        misunderstood—from which you thought we had regressed. And we have put in
                        the phrase “progressively reduce and finally withdraw” in a slightly
                        different context than you. So let me read it to you. “The U.S. acknowledges
                        that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but
                        one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S. does not challenge
                        that position. It reaffirms its view that the ultimate relationship between
                        Taiwan and the Mainland is not a matter for the U.S. to decide. It believes
                        that a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question by the parties concerned
                        would do much to reduce tensions in the Far East. This would enable the U.S.
                        to progressively reduce and finally withdraw all the U.S. troops and
                        military installations from Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We will study, and then we
                        will give you the reply. As Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> knows, that has been our practice on previous
                        occasions. We will make a serious study of it first and then we will
                        continue. From our side I have nothing more to say now. We need some time to
                        study it, and I will have to report to Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course. We have made
                        a serious effort to take your views into account, and we will continue to do
                        so as these discussions proceed. But I understand you have to study it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I do not want immediately to
                        comment on your draft now. I believe that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would understand how I feel about certain of the
                        wording here, but I will not go into it now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The two sentences in
                        the middle were from the World Report and were an attempt to take sentences
                        that you have indicated you approve.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I would clarify what I said
                        this morning about the World Report. I just want to point out in making the
                        report you indicated you do not want to affect any particular course any
                        side might take. In doing that I did not express that I approve.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d95-03" facs="d95-03"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no. You thought
                        what we had was a step backward from the World Report, so I wanted to go
                        back to the World Report.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: After we make the study we
                        will continue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You will notify us when
                        you are ready.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: The President and Premier
                        are going to meet at 5:00. If possible, the earliest time would be after the
                        duck dinner, and after we had the duck dinner we would have new energy to
                        have to deal with work.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I will be much
                        easier to deal with.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You may want to ask to
                        discuss this matter after you have passed that state in which you are easy
                        to deal with.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So, make sure you pick
                        the right moment.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The thing that, as I
                        said, holds my staff together is the hope that they will be there when I
                        collapse.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Let's begin our work. We
                        studied the formulation which you put forward, and I reported it to Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. I would like to
                        proceed in accordance with the spirit of the discussion held today with the
                        President and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> on Taiwan.
                        And I don't believe it is necessary for me to say much more on this. I would
                        first like to say something concerning your formulation—places we find
                        difficult for us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>; We thought the Prime
                        Ministers presentation showed a great understanding of the problem.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Thank you. In the draft
                        which you handed over this afternoon there is a possible misunderstanding of
                        what we meant when we mentioned <pb n="2" xml:id="d96-02" facs="d96-02"/>what was in the World Report. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said the ultimate relationship between Taiwan and the
                        Mainland is not for the U.S. to decide. In the context of the World Report
                        of the President it implied that you considered it to be an internal affair
                        of China, but in the context of the Communique we don't think this
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Now, why is that? Because it had already been made quite clear in the first
                        part of this paragraph that there is only one China. You have already made
                        clear that this is a matter between the two opposing sides in China. But to
                        say it here about the ultimate relationship between Taiwan and the Mainland,
                        this would imply two possibilities. One eventuality is that Taiwan would
                        separate itself from China and the other possibility would be to return to
                        the embrace of the motherland. Of course, I don't imply by that that that is
                        your implication when you say that. I am just saying that placed in this
                        context it will give my people this impression.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We took it out of
                        context—a slight misunderstanding of what the Vice Foreign Minister said. We
                        don't insist on this.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We suggest that this
                        sentence be deleted.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Alright.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Your following sentence
                        “[the U.S.] believes that a peaceful solution of the Taiwan question by the
                        parties concerned would do much to reduce tension in the Far East.” We think
                        the general meaning is alright but I would like to make some changes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I am afraid you
                        will take out the whole sentence.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Because you have repeated
                        the sentence …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no. Please give us
                        your ideas.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And then in your final
                        sentence you want to link the question of the final withdrawal with certain
                        conditions, and we should put it in such a way so that it would be passable
                        for you and for us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think the Prime
                        Minister expressed it very well this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: As for the first sentence,
                        there is the question that Taiwan is a province of China. That was
                        originally agreed upon but this morning you <pb n="3" xml:id="d96-03" facs="d96-03"/>told us in a frank way why you find it difficult to keep
                        that wording, although, in our view the reasons you advanced were
                        insufficient. I asked you why don't you ask <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> and why don't you ask <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>? But nevertheless, we are willing to
                        consider your difficulty in this matter. So we would like to make a
                        concession to you on this point and put this idea into our statement. In our
                        statement we would say Taiwan is a province of China.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>:
                        And us?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And for you Taiwan is a part
                        of China. That is to say we have made efforts in the general spirit of the
                        Prime Minister and the President to see to it that both your side and our
                        side will [be satisfied].</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, I am in the
                        same position as you were this afternoon. That is to say, I do not want to
                        reply to this hastily and I would like to discuss it with the President.
                        Just a preliminary comment. First, I recognize you have made an effort to
                        move to take into account our difficulties and in a preliminary way I think
                        that the first three sentences have moved us very far towards a solution. It
                        is the relationship between those and the last sentence that is frankly the
                        difficulty for both of us. And we will have to consider how … we realize
                        that you do not want to make it conditional, and we would like to imply to
                        some extent that it is. I am being very honest. But we will consider it.
                        This is just a preliminary reaction, and I would like to discuss it with the
                        President, and it is really this sentence at this moment that stands between
                        us. Let us consider it overnight with the President and get together
                        tomorrow morning again. Would that be a good way to proceed?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Alright.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now I have only the
                        concern how we will bring this to a conclusion, much as I enjoy the company
                        of the Vice Foreign Minister, and because I suppose you will have to
                        consider any counter proposal we make.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That is correct. This is a
                        crucial question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The other issues we
                        will settle relatively easy.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I believe there won't need
                        to be too much time spent on this, once this question is solved. As for the
                        others, even if there is some differences of views they can be overcome.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d96-04" facs="d96-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a few
                        suggestions on the part we discussed this morning. Should I give them to you
                        now or should we wait until morning?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You may as well tell us now.
                        I enjoy your company.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the first paragraph
                        of page 2 you are saying they reviewed the international situation in which
                        important changes are taking place and great upheavals exist. Upheavals do
                        not exist. So, I would like to take out the word “exist” and have “important
                        changes and great upheavals are taking place.” Consider it is purely a
                        stylistic point.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I don't believe there would
                        be any difficulty there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Where you say
                        “expressed their position and views”—purely stylistic—I am trying to refrain
                        from using “views” in both sentences. How about “attitudes"? Does it present
                        any problems?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “Positions and
                        attitudes"?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: As a matter of style.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the last paragraph
                        11 ”… people want revolution”—“revolutionary changes” is better for us.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We will consider the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In our section where we
                        say the U.S. side stated that in Asia—that paragraph in the middle where it
                        says ”… improving communication with countries that have different world
                        outlooks.” I think “ideology” is better in English than “world outlook.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We will consider it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> It will not fail for
                        that reason. I think if we settle everything except that one I will yield.
                        And one: other stylistic change which is not worth it now. We will do it
                        tomorrow. In that paragraph prior to the principles, where you say “it would
                        be against the interests of the peoples of the world for any major country
                        to collude against another country.” We are going to suggest “to divide up
                        into spheres of interest.”</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d96-05" facs="d96-05"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You mean for major countries
                        of the world to divide up into spheres of interest. We will review that. I
                        believe that on this matter there is no difference on our basic
                        thinking,</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Alright, Those are the
                        only changes I have now. Shall we meet tomorrow morning?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: As to when we will meet,
                        that is up to you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to talk with the
                        President. He is going to the Forbidden City and so the press will think I
                        am very blase—seen it once, why see it again.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Maybe they will think that
                        you are up to some collusion somewhere,</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They do. Mr. Cronkite
                        of CBS called today and insisted on talking to me to make sure I was still
                        in Peking. But, of course, I am up to some collusion.</p>
                    <p>Alright, let's say 10:00, because the President will be leaving by then, and
                        we will have discussed it by then.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have just been given
                        an <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> story—you can read it yourself. It is
                        not true. As I told the Prime Minister yesterday, most of our bureaucracy is
                        in favor of this course, and they have the tendency to leak to the press
                        what they would like to have happen. President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has talked to us about recognition after March 17.
                        That was his proposal to us. We have made no decision and we will relate it
                        to the withdrawal of Indian troops at the end of March. And, as the
                        President told the Prime Minister, we will inform you all before official
                        action is taken, and until then, none of this is to be taken as
                        authoritative.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am grateful to you and
                        there will be no misunderstanding on our part.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Secondly, and this is
                        simply for your information, you should know, as we said in our World
                        Report, that we are resuming humanitarian relief to East Bengal. We have
                        adopted the policy that we will do so only through the United Nations and
                        that we will contribute our normal contribution to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies which is to say around 33 percent. This is about
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d97-02" facs="d97-02"/>half of what we contributed
                        before. This is simply for your information. We will not make a big
                        announcement about it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Thank you. We are clear
                        about the purpose of your humanitarian relief which we had already read
                        about.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, to get back to our
                        communique. I have discussed your proposal of yesterday with the President
                        and he realizes that you have made a significant effort to take his problems
                        into account. We are therefore accepting the first three sentences as you
                        drafted them. So the only issue is the last sentence. And the President
                        himself, as you see here, drafted the version. I will give you a typed copy.
                        I just think the Vice Minister feels that I am cheating him if I don't show
                        him an internal document once a day. My assistants tell me the diplomatic
                        methods I pursue are highly unorthodox.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Revolutionary.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am on your side.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have rephrased the
                        end somewhat, quite frankly to make it a little vaguer, not because our
                        intentions are different, but because of the reasons the President and Prime
                        Minister discussed yesterday. There is a typographical error; we mean “on”
                        Taiwan not “in” Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: This is a very serious
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, of
                        course.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And I will adopt no hasty
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And I only express our
                        preliminary impressions. I realize indeed you have worked hard to try to
                        find a formulation. My preliminary impression is that the world “premise” is
                        very strong and somewhat difficult for us. But we will take a serious
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know you will.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d97-03" facs="d97-03"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And I will report to Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and after a careful
                        study then we will see whether we can find some way out. And with possible
                        alternatives just for reference sake, not as a formal suggestion, for use
                        for an alternative.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do I understand it is
                        the word “premise” that is the principal concern to you?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And then “looks to”—it is
                        too loose. It may even imply no action at all. I am not talking about what
                        actually will happen, but the way of expressing it, the impact on the
                        outside world. I recall that in one of your former suggestions you had a
                        formulation that “The U.S. accepts the ultimate objective of the withdrawal
                        of its forces from Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am looking for the
                        language on … yes, we could conceivably do this “based on this premise.” Of
                        course you understand I am somewhat limited by this, so we have to say this
                        is just thinking out loud.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: No commitment for either of
                        us on these comments.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Vice Minister has
                        correctly pointed out we have put this in the direction of vagueness for the
                        reason that the President gave to the Prime Minister yesterday. It would
                        serve nobody's purpose if we had to spend the next month after we return
                        explaining what we did not agree to. So we could conceivably say, “based on
                        this premise …”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am not quite familiar with
                        this … “on Taiwan” or “from Taiwan?”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would be glad to say
                        … “from” is fine.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Immediately before?</p>
                    <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's fine; that's no
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: . . I just remind you to
                        refresh your memory, “U.S. accepts the ultimate objective …” Originally your
                        suggestion then was “The U.S. accepts the ultimate objective … and pending
                        that …” Changed to ”… as tensions in Asia diminish …”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that easier for
                        you?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am just trying to refresh
                        your memory.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d97-04" facs="d97-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes I have it and it
                        was a proposal by me of course. You understood then that everything we were
                        discussing had to be discussed with the President, but I think we could work
                        with that sentence, if you would rather have that sentence.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That's not what I mean. What
                        I mean on that, the words “ultlimate objective” are words which can be used
                        as a reference.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, instead of “looks
                        to.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am also thinking out loud;
                        that is my personal, preliminary, and unofficial thinking. First, the word
                        “premise” is too strong, and second, the words “looking toward” are too
                        loose. I understand why you use the word “looks toward” because following
                        that you mention final withdrawal, so I believe that you used that for the
                        purpose of discussing your difficulties. On final withdrawal you want to be
                        loose?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely. Our problem
                        is—and you have stated your problem very fairly and clearly—our problem is
                        the word “hope” is too loose, and the word “intends” is too strong.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Both of use are just
                        thinking out loud. No commitment on either side.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely, I
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And I proceed entirely on
                        that constructive spirit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: All just thinking out loud.
                        As I said, for our side the difficulty with the word “premise” is that it is
                        too strong, and “looking to” is too loose. But we understand your difficulty
                        too—if you are to mention “final withdrawal” you want to put it too loose.
                        But for our side as far as public impact is concerned, it could appear you
                        are taking no action. So it is now a question of expression.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So both sides, particularly
                        for our side, will have to make a very careful study of this, and after that
                        I will have to report to Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>.
                        And then we can meet again.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d97-05" facs="d97-05"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is fine. I am
                        getting somewhat concerned for bureaucratic reasons about how we will bring
                        this process to a conclusion.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: What is your idea on
                        this?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And incidentally, we
                        will study this also, keeping in mind what you have said, and see what can
                        be done. Its … it will, based on past experience, take you several hours to
                        study this, will it not?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we have a session
                        this afternoon and a banquet this evening, and will be in Hangchou tomorrow.
                        And so I don't know how this will work out in terms of time.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am just expressing my
                        thinking. The ideal thing is for both sides to use the greatest effort to
                        see to it the substantive parts are agreed upon in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is exactly our
                        view.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: If we are able to succeed in
                        that, then you can tell your press we will have a communique. Yesterday
                        afternoon the Premier instructed us to complete it last night. But neither
                        of our sides were able to complete that task.</p>
                    <p>You blame me and I blame you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But you are wrong.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: What do you think of
                        this?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we should
                        finish it today. It would help us with our own bureaucracy. Incidentally, in
                        the spirit of frankness with which we have dealt with each other, I want you
                        to know what we have done in our government. We have given the Secretary of
                        State the draft you handed us yesterday morning—the old draft, which is
                        almost the same as your first draft, not the one of last night—simply so
                        that he knows from what base we were operating when we came up with
                        something better, and so that we can show him that you have made significant
                        concessions yourself. So if he mentions anything to your Foreign Minister,
                        it is the old version that he has seen. But only on Taiwan—nothing else has
                        been shown to him because we have a serious internal problem on it, as you
                        know. To help <pb n="6" xml:id="d97-06" facs="d97-06"/>your thinking, you
                        consider “premise” too strong and “looks to” too vague. As we try to work on
                        this we cannot both weaken “premise” and strengthen “looks to” so maybe a
                        compromise can be found by finding a formulation where one or the other gets
                        improved or both get improved a little bit. But if one becomes more
                        specific, the other has to get a little stronger. I am just telling you the
                        philosophy with which we approach it. For example—and now I am thinking out
                        loud completely and it may not be approved by the President—I could imagine
                        that it could drop the word “premise” and “hope” and simply say “with this
                        in mind, the United States looks to …”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That's one way of thinking.
                        I also think out loud.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That is to say, as I said to
                        you many times, if there is no mention of a final withdrawal, it will be
                        impossible for us to … But then on your side, if there were “final
                        withdrawal” to be mentioned, then as to how you should look on this final
                        withdrawal is your difficulty. From your point of view that must be put in a
                        loose way. So I am just thinking whether it is possible to put words
                        “ultimate objective” before, in front. Just thinking out loud.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely, but the
                        reason why this is so helpful is if we go off and write something and you go
                        off and write something without knowing our thinking, we may be exchanging
                        papers . .</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I have no complete
                        formulation in mind. Just thinking if we consider putting words “ultimate
                        objective” in front and then as to the verb which will characterize the
                        progressive reduction, your verb is “look to”—our verb is “will, ”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, “progressive
                        reduction” we don't mind being more specific about. It's the “final
                        withdrawal” that we want to be vague about,</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So in that case, if
                        “ultimate objective” is placed in front then the verb which would describe
                        how you take the action of progressive reduction would be stronger,</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d97-07" facs="d97-07"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We know that your difficulty
                        lies in this “final withdrawal.” Because otherwise you will find it
                        difficult to account to your opponents. But if it. were not for the word
                        “final withdrawal” for us we could not make an accounting to our people.
                        That is where the difficulty lies.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: (whispers to <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>, unintelligible)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Does he want to accept
                        it?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Collude with you against
                        me.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kissiger: That's my dream. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>
                        says he is already on your side anyway. Judging by the quality of his work I
                        have already suspected that.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: … … in your own
                        collapse.</p>
                    <p>BREAK—10:15 - 10:37 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We think we could, for
                        example, change the word “premise” to “prospect, “ “with this prospect in
                        mind …” It's a little stronger than “hope” and a little weaker than
                        “premise.” And just again thinking out loud, to indicate a direction and
                        since this is of such great domestic importance to the President—you
                        understand that I will have to discuss this with him when he returns—we
                        could, for example…”with this prospect in mind, the U.S. anticipates …”
                        Anticipates means it will happen; we look forward to its happening.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: With this prospect in mind …
                        but so far as progressive reductions is concerned, you just say
                        “anticipate”—that is too light. “With this prospect in mind …” that's too
                        light. I will study that again. I would now like to have some comments on
                        …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me tell the Vice
                        Minister this, the following. We can reduce forces on Taiwan and we intend
                        to during the next year, for example, or certainly as Vietnam diminishes. To
                        the extent that the President can say it is not based on an agreement and
                        that it is a unilateral decision based on our judgment of the situation.
                        This is why we want to say something other than “will.” Could I have your
                        other comments?</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d97-08" facs="d97-08"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Let us think about various
                        possibilities. First of all, our comment on your formulation. The word
                        “premise” is indeed a very strong word, and speaking from the point of view
                        of logic, “premise” is inseparable from consequence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: A Hegelian student.</p>
                    <p>(Laughter)</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: The point is that if that is
                        the premise, then that means that a peaceful settlement had already been
                        brought about between us and the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> regime. If that is the case, how is there a question
                        of progressive reduction—it will not be a question of withdrawing. If we are
                        to consider accepting the word “premise” then it should be like this: “Based
                        on this premise, the United States will withdraw all its forces and military
                        installations from Taiwan.” That is one possible formulation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Good, “based on the
                        premise …” Just so we understand each other, because we will have to explain
                        it to the press. If this were one proposal and we accept it, then we say to
                        the press in case of a peaceful solution, we will withdraw all of our
                        troops. Is that correct?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Withdrawal of all your
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So you say it's
                        possible, thinking out loud, that if you were to accept the word “premise”
                        we should then just say “will finally withdraw all our forces.” In other
                        words, “based on this premise, the U.S. will withdraw all its forces.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That's one possibility. And
                        then another possibility is to delete the word “premise.” Something like
                        this: “With this prospect in mind, the U.S. will progressively reduce its
                        military … something like that … with the ultimate objective … . Just some
                        thinking on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Another possibility is to delete “premise” and say: “With this prospect in
                        mind, the U.S. will progressively reduce its forces on Taiwan with the
                        ultimate objective of total withdrawal,” something like that.</p>
                    <p>And then a third possibility, “It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful
                        settlement of the Taiwan question, by the Chinese themselves, and accepts
                        the <pb n="9" xml:id="d97-09" facs="d97-09"/>ultimate objective of the
                        withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Taiwan. With this in mind it will
                        progressively reduce its forces as the tension in the area diminishes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Give me the other
                        possibilities so I can take them up with the President.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “Based on this premise, the
                        U.S. will withdraw all its troops and military installations from Taiwan.”
                        And, “With this prospect in mind”—weakened “this premise”—the United States
                        will progressively reduce its troops and military installations on Taiwan
                        with a complete withdrawal as its ultimate objective.</p>
                    <p>Neither of us are commited. I aim to find something mutually acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we are heading
                        in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: What other business?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I suggest that you
                        might wish to consult with the Prime Minister. When shall we meet again?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We will tell you about the
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be good if we
                        could perhaps … I have one other idea … there would be a certain
                        advantage—thinking out loud about time—if we could get the Formosa part
                        settled before the session this afternoon—we could move the session to 4:00
                        this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We can suggest that to the
                        President and Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and finish the
                        rest of it after dinner tonight.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We hope. But both you and he
                        have to.</p>
                    <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But if you should be
                        instructed before the President returns from the Forbidden City, let us meet
                        anyway. Because I will have your suggestions and I can take them up with him
                        immediately. I am just thinking how to save time.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes, we will consider that

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: In this counter-proposal we
                        had absorbed some of the things which you put forward in your last
                        suggestion and we will suggest as follows, on the last sentence: “With this
                        prospect in mind, the United States anticipates the progressive reduction
                        and final withdrawal of all U.S. forces and military installations from
                        Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>Now I will read the whole thing: “The U.S. side declared: The U.S.
                        acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain
                        there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States
                        Government does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in a
                        peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves. With
                        this prospect in mind, the United States anticipates the progressive
                        reduction and final withdrawal of all U.S. forces and military installations
                        from Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>That is according to instructions given to me by Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d98-02" facs="d98-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I see the text?</p>
                    <p>As you said, this is a very serious matter for both of us because it is a
                        matter of great political consequence for the President, of how it will be
                        represented when he returns. Well, I think we are very close to we are
                        moving closer together. Will you be in this villa for awhile?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes, surely.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why don't I talk to the
                        President and get his reaction because I think it isn't sensible to give a
                        quick reaction. We can meet again in a little while, about half an hour,
                        3:00. So we will tell our colleagues we had a terrible row.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Should we issue a communique
                        to that effect?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course.</p>

                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Friday, February 25, 1972, - 3:35-4:00 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to be frank with
                        you what our problem is—the President is taking a nap, and I didn't want to
                        wake him up. So in order not to waste the time I wanted to give you some of
                        our considerations. We have not yet had time to discuss it with the
                        President. And I understand what you have attempted to do. You have tried to
                        weaken premise” and strengthen “look to” and come up with a balance that
                        way. Let me tell you something that we had done in the break, in the
                        interval between the two meetings. This the President has approved; he
                        approved it before I came here at 2:30. But I didn't table it because I
                        wanted to discuss your draft with the President, and I was waiting for him.
                        Now it doesn't look as if he will get up until just before the meeting. But
                        of course we will discuss your draft with him.</p>
                    <p>Our problem is that the way your last sentence is formulated will raise this
                        question. The first question I will be asked at the press conference is
                        “What exactly does this mean?” They will say “are you going to withdraw <pb n="2" xml:id="d99-02" facs="d99-02"/>your forces because you hope that
                        there will be a peaceful settlement, or are you going to withdraw your
                        forces only if there is a peaceful settlement?” Then if I say we will
                        withdraw them only if there is a peaceful settlement, I think the Vice
                        Minister will not be fully happy with me.</p>
                    <p>So what we had done in the interval before the 2:30 meeting was to take some
                        of the third formulation of the Vice Minister before lunch, which we
                        recognize was in no way official, and you are in no way bound by it, or
                        committed to it. We used it just for our thinking—and phrased it in a way
                        which has the great advantage that we can do everything it says without
                        having to give a tricky explanation. This is what the President worked on
                        before. Let me just show it to you. If by chance you were able to accept
                        this, it would solve all our problems.</p>
                    <p>I will submit your version to the President, and this is not to be taken as a
                        rejection completely of all the elements, but this one I know we can accept;
                        the other we have to wait. It has the advantage that it affirms the ultimate
                        objective which the Prime Minister when he called on me briefly on some
                        other matters said was the one with which he was concerned, and states the
                        reduction which we can defend as an American initiative and not as a
                        negotiation with you.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I understand what you
                        mean.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On one interpretation
                        yours is easier for us.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I think that there is some
                        formulation which will be easy for you: for instance, “With this prospect in
                        mind …” That is not right away but … then follows the word “anticipate.”
                        There is very little restraining effect. For instance, speaking purely from
                        your angle, you could well say that as you consider progress is being made
                        in a peaceful solution of this problem so you will be able to anticipate a
                        progressive reduction.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Progressive reduction”
                        is not the problem. It's the final withdrawal that …</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You can link that up with
                        the peaceful settlement. As I said this morning, once a peaceful settlement,
                        there will be no reason for you to stay.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d99-03" facs="d99-03"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, there is no
                        problem, and in fact, we can have a substantial withdrawal without a
                        peaceful settlement as long as we don't do it as part of an agreement with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You can say that entirely as
                        your own initiative, not as an agreement between you and us. That is, you
                        consider there is such a prospect. And you consider that that prospect is
                        coming closer. And so you are able to make the progressive reduction. As for
                        what happens finally, you can entirely link that up with the peaceful
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But if we can do that
                        in language then we have no problem.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: As the President said, the
                        important thing is for both sides to leave some running room.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You see in this draft
                        which we worked on over the luncheon break we linked up the final withdrawal
                        with the prospect of a final settlement. Thus, we are then of course in the
                        position if we are asked to interpret it the way the Minister suggested and
                        we will say we will withdraw our forces anyway.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am … concerning your
                        formulation on the reduction of tensions, speaking frankly, it is quite
                        difficult for us to have this linked up with the question of the relaxation
                        of tension in this area and if that is to be said it will be difficult for
                        you to explain in the future as well. Because in that wording “The United
                        States anticipates …” has no binding effect. We made great efforts in
                        accepting this word “anticipate.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Even if we can't come
                        to an agreement, I understand you have made a major effort and have come a
                        long way toward us, and it is the objective difficulty of the subject which
                        is between us. We can say “in Asia” rather than “in the area,” but that
                        makes it worse.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Of course, as I said last
                        time, people will say they are making use of Taiwan as a trick. Of course,
                        in actuality, that is not so, but they can say that. The actual fact would
                        not be that case, but to be open, for us to say that would be difficult.
                        That is our consideration.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So it is our contention that
                        we should leave it only linked with the question of Taiwan itself. And we
                        accepted both words “prospect” and “anticipate.”</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d99-04" facs="d99-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. You
                        haven't been unfair. Usually people can't agree on what to do. Here we have
                        agreed on what to do and we can't agree on what to say.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And it is indeed true that
                        as to what is to be said you have your difficulties and we have ours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know it. I am fully
                        aware of it. So our problem is, as the President explained, if we go home
                        and people say we sold out in Peking and we use the vagueness of this
                        formulation to prove we didn't and we have no obligation at all, and foreign
                        radios start beaming it to your country that we tricked you, then you aren't
                        going to gain a great deal either. If the President and I are going to spend
                        the next two weeks explaining that this doesn't mean anything, then we are
                        in trouble. If I say this means something only if Taiwan agrees to a
                        negotiation, but Taiwan isn't going to agree to a negotiation—this is the
                        line of argumentation that we would use. Then we haven't anything; what have
                        we achieved?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: How do you consider this
                        suggestion …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thinking out loud
                        again.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “With this in mind … .
                        withdrawal of U.S. forces from Taiwan. In the meantime it anticipates the
                        progressive withdrawal of …”</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): Do you want me to repeat that?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know what he did.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It's just my personal
                        thinking. You can explain it only from the prospects.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it moves us
                        closer to the … it moves us closer.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Also it only
                        anticipates.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d99-05" facs="d99-05"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Nothing else.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “In the meantime, it
                        anticipates the progressive reduction of those forces …”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And military installations. </p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's your problem.
                        That is not the hang-up to us. The hang-up is …</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That is to say, this is the
                        long-range objective.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we say “consistent
                        with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine?”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You can say it somewhere,
                        but not in this communique.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You know you got me
                        into bad trouble with the President. I told the President if he mentioned
                        the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to the Prime
                        Minister he would undoubtedly get a short response. He mentioned it and he
                        did not get a short response, so now the President thinks I don't know
                        anything about the Chinese any more.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We have to ask for
                        instructions from the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly, and I
                        haven't seen the President. Could you hold up the Prime Minister for five
                        minutes?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Oh surely.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Hold him up for ten
                        minutes because I don't want the President to meet without even knowing
                        about your draft.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Remind you this is only my
                        preliminary.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand and we
                        will not ever hold you to anything you say in this manner. If you get
                        different instructions we will not hold you to them.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I think five minutes is too
                        short. We should delay until 4:30 p.m.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The President thought he
                        would not do the actual drafting in a meeting and that he would convey his
                        thoughts so that when you meet each would know exactly what the differences
                        are.</p>
                    <p>I also want to tell you on behalf of the President that we recognize that you
                        have dealt with this in a farsighted spirit. The difficulties have to do
                        with how we present this at home and not your attitude. Nothing we say
                        implies any criticism of what your side has done.</p>
                    <p>Our difficulty with the formulation the Vice Minister brought us this
                        afternoon is really somewhat embarrassing because I recognize what you did
                        was to meet 90 percent of our proposal. The problem is when we come home we
                        have to meet the press and the Congress. Now then, we can explain that this
                        doesn't mean anything and therefore anticipations will <pb n="2" xml:id="d100-02" facs="d100-02"/>not arise. After all we have discussed,
                        this is an unworthy manner of dealing with you. So we don't want to have to
                        be tricky in our explanation.</p>
                    <p>On the one hand, we have a problem that if we state a reduction of forces
                        without reciprocity we will be accused of having come to Peking and being
                        taken in. On the other hand, we recognize—the President recognizes—your
                        issue of principle on reciprocity with respect to an island you consider
                        your own. As the President explained to you, we can reduce our forces as
                        long as we can present it to our people as our unilateral decision.</p>
                    <p>For example, we had not intended to mention it here because we didn't think
                        it was proper to discuss it here … we have the intention of reducing our
                        forces on Taiwan during the next year by 3,000, which is about 40 percent.
                        But we would like to present this to our Congress as a unilateral American
                        decision. So this is our dilemma.</p>
                    <p>Now on the text we have no problem about affirming the ultimate objective of
                        withdrawal of American forces and military installations from Taiwan. We can
                        say that with this prospect in mind, “it affirms the ultimate objective,”
                        etc. The difficulty arises with stating the progressive reduction
                        unconditionally, and I know your difficulty arises from stating it
                        conditionally. I repeat that this does not affect what the President has
                        told you he will do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Didn't you tell the Vice
                        Minister that deleting the phrase “as tensions in the area are reduced”
                        makes the position closer because it is linked to a peaceful settlement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> That's what the Vice
                        Minister told me. We could put it “as progress is made toward a peaceful
                        settlement” or, linking it to tension in the Taiwan Straits, “as tensions in
                        the Taiwan Straits are reduced.” We don't want to embarrass you.</p>
                    <p>Ch'iao: Please repeat the second formulation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “As tensions in the Taiwan
                        Straits diminish.” I am thinking out loud, really, or secondly, “as progress
                        is made toward a peaceful solution,” or something like that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: If you say, “tensions in the
                        area” they will say, “what area?”.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d100-03" facs="d100-03"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. That's why
                        we could say “in the Taiwan Straits.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But there are no longer tensions
                        in the Taiwan Straits now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's not … or “as progress
                        is made toward a peaceful settlement.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Your problem is that you need
                        some kind of condition for reductions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not setting
                        conditions. We will do it, as you know, in any event. You could draw up a
                        sentence about progressive reductions and just end with the ultimate
                        objective if you like.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The President's idea is that we
                        should not mention this in our talks, since we discussed it yesterday?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would just as soon not.
                        If you want us now to explain our position to you, we can do it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You said earlier that the
                        Secretary of State would join the talks this afternoon on the
                        Communique.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not on the Communique. It
                        was just for the press. If it were to be a long session then the ministers
                        could come in for an hour for picturetaking purposes. The Communique we
                        could do without unless you want. We will complete it by the process that
                        was agreed to.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Mr. President said that the
                        plenary meeting may be held in Hangchow.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And therefore in the latter part
                        of this afternoon's session, as he suggested, only the Secretary of State
                        and the Foreign Minister take part and not the others.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>. But that was when we thought that we
                        would meet at 3:00 and have a long time. It is not necessary. I think it is
                        better that you and the President talk personally. But we leave this to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In the Communique there are two
                        other points that are not completed yet. Those are not difficult.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. We can do it. The rest
                        of the Communique may take maybe two hours.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d100-04" facs="d100-04"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You could do it after
                        dinner.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no problem with
                        that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But I will have a meeting with
                        the President to discuss some other matters. I will hold further
                        consultations on this clause on Taiwan and the Vice Minister will reply to
                        you after dinner. We want to see if we can approximate positions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to say—this is very
                        unorthodox—that you have made the bigger moves in recent days. We cannot
                        complain about anything you have done. You have been very generous. We
                        recognize you consider this your own country. You might take the position
                        that you should not talk to us about this at all. I am sorry we have so many
                        domestic difficulties, but our actions will be more impressive than our
                        words.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As your President said, you can
                        do more than you can say.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That will be the case.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I will go over at 5:30 and we
                        can talk until 6:30 and have the banquet at 7:30. There is no need for the
                        Secretary of State and Foreign Minister to take part altogether?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you think?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There is the question that if
                        there's a meeting, everyone should participate for us, the Vice Chairman,
                            <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LX1">Li Hsien-nien</persName> and everyone involved, because
                        they are not going to Hangchow. The plane tomorrow is at 9:00 o'clock. If we
                        are able to agree on the whole Communique tonight, should we let the party
                        see it only when it is published or beforehand?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After an agreement is
                        worked out, we must show it to the Secretary of State. He will not leak it.
                        This he does not do. We will show it to nobody else, and we would agree on
                        when to release it. Maybe in Shanghai Sunday night—what do you think?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The time for release may be
                        decided by you. We will leave the decision up to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Perhaps it should be done
                        from Shanghai on Sunday in the late afternoon. And I would agree with the
                        Prime Minister and the Vice Minister on exactly what I would say when I talk
                        to the press. I would tell you ahead of time. Until then only the Secretary
                        of State will see it, if that is agreeable to you.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d100-05" facs="d100-05"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>One possibility is, as Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName> and the Vice Premier <persName corresp="#p_LX1">Li
                            Hsien-nien</persName> and others will be sending the President and his
                        party off at the airport, maybe we could have a very quick session at the
                        airport at which all could talk in the sitting room at the airport.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So they can also
                        participate.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: For us, all our people would
                        take part who were at the plenary, and for you, your people could take part
                        who were at the plenary. At this meeting we could say that certain
                        agreements have been reached by the two sides and after making necessary
                        preparations they could be turned into a Communique.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At Shanghai there would be
                        the final Communique.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There is no need for us to show
                        the document at the plenary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It should be done in a
                        very general way. I cannot guarantee the security of everybody.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It might be better not to do
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We could have a plenary
                        session where the Foreign Ministers report about their work in the other
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That would be too long then.</p>
                    <p>Well, maybe we could finish the Communique tonight. As for the question of
                        people-to-people trade and exchanges, it could be said at the plenary that
                        this was a possibility. Maybe that's not appropriate?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I must be honest. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> will not leak, but some of
                        the junior men that are in the group, I have an uneasy feeling, do leak. I
                        don't think we should let anything out before the Communique unless you want
                        to.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d100-06" facs="d100-06"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It will just be a simple plenary
                        meeting tomorrow morning at the airport. Because Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName> and Vice Premier <persName corresp="#p_LX1">Li Hsien-nien</persName> must have an opportunity to
                        take part in one more meeting. We can say that the five days of talks have
                        been fruitful and say nothing about the contents.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or say that we hope to
                        have a Communique without saying what it is, and that we will finalize it in
                        Hangchow, or something.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will just tell them that we
                        hope it will be completed but we haven't worked it out yet. We hope there
                        will be a Communique but we haven't worked it out yet. We can talk in
                        general terms in the plenary session.</p>
                    <p>So we will make a final session in Peking. When we go to Hangchow we will not
                        bother with plenary meetings, just private talks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At some point it would be
                        helpful for the morale of the group if something could be done for those who
                        feel neglected.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We can do that by some other
                        means. But the meeting at the airport will still be a form of a plenary
                        session. There will be fifteen on your side.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I guess the whole official
                        party?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Everyone will be happier. A
                        formal plenary session? And I will think of other things to improve
                        morale.</p>

                    <p>The Foreign Minister opened by apologizing for being so late and said that
                        since there was only a half hour left until the reciprocal banquet, he would
                        be pleased to hear the Secretary's views.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he wanted to talk about contacts and communications,
                        items discussed during the first day of our talks.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister responded if the Secretary had any specifics to add he
                        would be delighted to hear about them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wanted to learn what facilities for improved contacts
                        in communications were acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Both sides had agreed that better communications and contacts
                        were in mutual interest. However, we could discuss it at a later time if the
                        Foreign Minister preferred.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that he preferred to discuss this topic at the end
                        of the talks.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Southeast Asia</p>
                    <p>In the past two days, the Secretary said, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had criticized <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy and
                        charged the United States with a number of alleged wrongs against the people
                        of China. The United States side had answered these criticisms, but has not
                        recorded our own criticisms or those of our allies against the PRO. Although
                        we think there is a better way to spend our time, we should record our
                        criticisms briefly. The United States opposes the propaganda, material aid
                        and subversive activities which the PRO is applying against the countries of
                        Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        is aware that the PRO is supporting with arms and equipment North Vietnamese
                        troops who are threatening Thailand's northern borders. The United States
                        Government has consulted with the Thai Government and they have stopped
                        their broadcasts against the PRO. Why has the PRO continued its hostile
                        activities against Thailand, the Secretary concluded?</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Common Support for the Public Welfare</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued his statement saying that the talks had shown that
                        both sides operate from different premises but our goals and principles and
                        interests are similar in many respects. We share, for instance, an interest
                        in the welfare of our peoples and in a peaceful world. It is apparent to the
                        United States that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Government has
                        worked diligently and successfully for the improvement and the welfare of
                        its people. Compared to past periods of history the Government has made
                        progress in feeding and clothing the Chinese people. The Prime Minister had
                        said yesterday that constituted governments should be dealt with on the
                        basis of the five principles regardless of the form the government takes.
                        The United States agrees with this and feels that proceeding from this
                        common ground, we can move gradually to improve our relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>-Thai Relations</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said he would first like to speak to the question of
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>-Thai relations. Historically, China
                        had maintained good relations with the people of Thailand. However, after
                        the civil war, <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> troops
                        withdrew to Thailand and the Thai Government made use of these troops. The
                        Thai Government has pursued anti-China policies since the founding of the
                        PRO. That is why we have had no contacts and still have none. Despite the
                        fact that the cabinet has been reshuffled, the Thai Government continues to
                        pursue its old policies.</p>
                    <p>The PRO is not interfering in the internal affairs of Thailand. If the Thai
                        people want revolution, that is their affair. We are willing to have normal
                        relations on the basis of the five principles. However, as long as they
                        pursue a policy which is against China and which supports the Viet-Nam War,
                        we will not be able to establish relations. Thailand is a good friend of the
                        United States which is used as a base to unleash war in Indochina. The
                        United States and the PRO have very different views on this question and I
                        hope that you will convey them to your old friends. The PRO makes no secret
                        of the fact, the Foreign Minister continued, that Thai leaders of guerrilla
                        forces waging revolution in <pb n="4" xml:id="d101-04" facs="d101-04"/>Thailand live in Peking. This is because we share their ideological
                        beliefs in Communism, Marxism and Leninism. But ideology and State relations
                        are different and the fact that we share different ideological views does
                        not mean we cannot improve the ties between governments. When the Thai
                        guerrilla leaders return to their country, and whether they support the
                        government there or not, is their affair. We will not interfere.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that he wanted the Secretary to be clear on the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> position.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House, Villa 2, Peking</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: First with the Taiwan question and on that last sentence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have reached the
                        point where I am rejecting my own drafts.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You want to start all over again? I have one vice. When I start
                        speaking, I must smoke.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't want to tell
                        you to stop speaking.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Let us go straight to the point. Following the discussion between
                        the Premier and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and in
                        the spirit of that discussion, and after making a study after that
                        discussion, and before the Premier met with the President, we have decided
                        to accept your proposal.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d102-02" facs="d102-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which is what?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: In the meantime—with respect to withdrawal of all forces—“it will
                        progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan …” With
                        the exception of adding the words “military installations.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No problem. It is
                        awfully hard to argue when you accept my proposal [laughter]. What I would
                        really like to do is interrupt for ten minutes and go over to see the
                        President. I can't argue with you about your accepting my proposal.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> will argue for
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me just read to you
                        what I understand it is. “The U.S. side declared: the U.S. acknowledges that
                        all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one
                        China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does
                        not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in the peaceful
                        settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves.” And then “in
                        the meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military
                        installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes.”</p>
                    <p>When you hear a loud voice you will find you have a new applicant in your
                        foreign office.</p>
                    <p>(The meeting adjourned for a few minutes at 10:40 p.m. while Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> checked the draft with the
                        President. The meeting then resumed at 11:00 p.m.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Much as I enjoy arguing
                        with you, the President accepts this, with one suggestion which is not
                        essential. Where it says “it reaffirms its interest in the peaceful
                        settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves”—he wonders if
                        you could say “the Chinese on both sides of the Strait” to make it
                        consistent with the second line.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is what is to be meant anyway.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, it is really more
                        for clarity.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d102-03" facs="d102-03"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Our putting this is not—the actual purpose is for simplicity. It
                        was quite alright to add it. Taiwan Strait. We don't have to repeat it. Add
                        Taiwan Strait—originally it was our intention to make it simpler but since
                        we want to make it more clear, we might as well make it more clear. “It
                        reaffirms its interest in the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by
                        the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” It is also in the first
                        sentence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My colleagues wonder
                        whether we include the off-shore islands in these. If you do anything
                        militarily, we will not be able to wave a piece of paper at you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: As far as this paragraph is concerned, that's the only change.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Then we consider
                        it agreed.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Basically—essentially. If there are any other changes it would be
                        changes like that. We will start from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Go on from here, and
                        then we go back to the beginning.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The next is concerning the question of people-to-people contacts.
                        Basically speaking, we agree with your draft, but we made some slight
                        changes. That's the latter part. The last sentence of the first paragraph we
                        suggest: “Each side undertook to facilitate the further development of such
                        contacts and exchanges.” Just to make it more concise. The meaning is the
                        same.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Minister, just one
                        point which we don't have to waste time on now. But there seems to be a
                        change in tenses. Some things are in the present and some are in the past.
                        We are doing this to clean up the style.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No question about that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Each side undertakes
                        to facilitate the further development of such contacts and exchanges.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Tonight, we will just basically agree on the paper and make some
                        stylistic changes.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d102-04" facs="d102-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I accept this, subject
                        to any advice I will get from my right.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We would like to make it read, “both sides view bilateral trade as
                        another area from which mutual benefit could be derived and agreed that
                        economic relations based on equality and mutual benefit are in the interest
                        of the peoples of the two countries. They agreed to facilitate the gradual
                        development of trade,” I don't find it necessary to explain this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The question of
                        normalization we raised the last time.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And because our relations are only in the process of being
                        normalized.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My one concern is the
                        word “gradual”—“Progressive?”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Quite all right. But in Chinese it is the same—“progressive
                        development”—“facilitate the progressive development of trade.” Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, would you read
                        this?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Development of trade
                        between their two countries, or between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “Between the two countries.” The implication is not quite
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>Now let's go back to the beginning. “The two sides agreed that they would
                        stay in contact through various channels. In addition, the U.S. Government
                        will send a senior representative to Peking from time to time for concrete
                        consultations to further the normalization of relations between the two
                        governments and continue to exchange views on issues of common
                        interest.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This may not be the
                        time, but what if we are asked about channels? How do you plan to answer? I
                        understand from the Prime Minister what you wish—as I understand it, it is
                        to do it through New York primarily now. But I understand also you don't
                        want to have that publicly known. That's the channel we use secretly.</p>
                    <p>Now, we can say one of two things. We can say it is still under discussion,
                        what forms of channels will be established. And what we ought to
                            consider—<pb n="5" xml:id="d102-05" facs="d102-05"/>you might discuss
                        this with the Prime Minister—to have someone different from New York where
                        the State Department can pass whatever technical messages it might have on
                        trade, and we can say that is the channel. We said we used Warsaw once so
                        that then technically is one place, which we do not mind.</p>
                    <p>So when I am asked—so my answer will be this is still in the process of
                        discussion, and we have not yet got it formally settled. And some time later
                        your leaders may know where you want it to take place and we will use that
                        for the passing of technical documents.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Okay.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are assuming that
                        you have no interest at this time, such an interest say with another
                        embassy. In Canada, for example.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You mean through a third country?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think your suggestion
                        for an open reply to those who ask us is correct—that is, this matter is
                        still under discussion.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And we will consider some place where we can have communications
                        and take technical matters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And then just so I am
                        clear, we will use Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                            Hua</persName> for secret communications; what we used to pass through
                        Paris. Now no one knows.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I will give a reply to you on that after asking for my
                        instructions from my Prime Minister. I want to confirm that because as time
                        passes New York may not be a very safe place.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We know how to do it.
                        If we can't arrange for a secret meeting in New York then we can't do
                        anything.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We will not discuss it now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And then the following paragraph, the first sentence is moved to
                        the front. And then no more following that up to the very end. But there is
                        a suggested change in this sentence.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d102-06" facs="d102-06"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The one which we are
                        considering?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, yes. The two leaders “were gratified to have this
                        opportunity” and we suggest to say the two leaders “considered it beneficial
                        to have …”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Minister, “the
                        leaders of China and the United States considered it beneficial” is fine,
                        “to have this opportunity, after so many years”. I think to say “The leaders
                        of China and the United States considered,— found it beneficial to have this
                        opportunity, after so many years without contact and express their views”—it
                        is just English.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes. “Found it beneficial.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is stronger—to have
                        this opportunity after so many years without contact, to have the
                        opportunity to frankly present—present frankly to one another their views.
                        It is not very strong in English—I don't object to it. It is just not very
                        strong.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I agree it is better than “gratified.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am just trying to
                        find a stronger adjective. Found “invaluable”—although beneficial is a
                        little reserved, it is substantive.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Then back to the Taiwan question. The President made his
                        suggestion. I reported this to the Premier, and he said there was no need
                        for this addition. He does object because it was already said all Chinese on
                        both sides—it does not have to be repeated. And then secondly, you wish to
                        see a peaceful settlement by the Chinese on both sides. And thirdly, we have
                        already accepted in its entirety the principles put forward by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on this. And we have made so many
                        efforts. Why should there be any changes on it? But we will not object when
                        you explain the Communique. You can say that when it says “by the Chinese
                        themselves,” it means Chinese on both sides of the Straits.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will have to accept
                        it ad referendum. I will check it with the President who is probably
                        retired. I think he will accept it. I am practically certain.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d102-07" facs="d102-07"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We can settle it if the President wants to have a word with the
                        Prime Minister on the airplane. I do not believe the Communique will fail on
                        those three words. I think it can be settled. And then subject to any
                        changes by our two leaders it will be as we handed it to you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I just made a slight
                        reservation that the President may wish to raise it on the plane.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Actually the interpretation will be just the same.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have made a
                        considerable move. When I pass it to the press and when we inform other
                        governments, then …</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No question about that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will say with the
                        approval of the Government of the People's Republic of China this is our
                        mutual understanding. May I take these quotes off?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: The Vice Minister said it is self-evident because anyone can see
                        from the preceding sentence it is Chinese on both sides of the Straits.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Now, shall we start from the beginning and go up to the end? There
                        may still be some points which have not been finalized.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. We will have to
                        check with the President if he wants to use his middle initial. We will
                        speak about the most important problems first. If he does not use his middle
                        initial, none of us will.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We will respect the decision of your President on that. If one has
                        it, then everybody has it. We don't have this problem of middle initials.
                        That is your decision.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will drop the “En”
                        out of <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: After we have read the Communique, it still will be subject to
                        final approval.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d102-08" facs="d102-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Where are we starting?
                        First, “The two leaders held”—Why don't we—shouldn't we say, “the two
                        leaders had a serious and frank discussion on Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations and world affairs”—which is what the Communique
                        says. Is that agreeable?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “The two leaders had a serious and frank discussion on Sino-U.S.
                        relations and world affairs.” It is alright. There will be no “exchange of
                        views.” And then the dates February 21, and on the first paragraph from
                        February 21 to February 28, 1972. But it will be published on the 27th.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That doesn't affect
                        it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “Earnest and frank?” I would say the two leaders had a serious and
                        frank discussion—exchange of views on Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't think it adds
                        anything in English.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: If they exchanged views on Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        relations, what did they discuss? You want to say “had a serious and frank
                        exchange of views on Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations and,”
                        etc. But then immediately following that the last paragraph—“the two sides
                        had discussions.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's airight.

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I make a suggestion
                        on the next one? During the visit rather than say “further”, I would say
                        “extensive” discussions.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “There were extensive …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why don't we say:
                        “During the visit, extensive and earnest and frank discussions were held

                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We have here another suggestion. “During the visit, extensive,

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do we need the list of
                        everybody else who participated in these discussions? I don't care—is it
                        your custom?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We will consider that. What is your preference?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me check with the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Only a technical matter. Just a formality. Leave it for the time
                        being.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “And they toured
                        Hangchow and Shanghai.” We are making a slight change in the English:
                        “where, continuing discussions with Chinese leaders, they viewed similar
                        places of interest.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: They also toured Hangchow and Shanghai, where, continuing

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is better English.
                        It is purely stylistic.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The next page—will you read it out?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Shall I read—“The

                        present frankly to one another their views on a variety of issues. They
                        reviewed the international situation in which important changes and great
                        upheavals are taking place and expounded their respective positions and

                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “The leaders of China and the United States found it beneficial to

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Then the next paragraph—“the people want revolution” -</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I had not been sure we
                        had agreed on that. In other words you prefer to keep it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “The people want revolution.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is going to make
                        some people extremely unhappy, but I won't call attention to the fact.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Your assistants will agree to this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's why I am keeping
                        them in a state of panic.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Then it is on the question of the elaboration of the two key
                        principles—on Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “The Chinese side expressed its firm support to the peoples of
                        Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in their efforts for the attainment of their goal
                        and its firm support to the sevenpoint proposal of the Provisional
                        Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam and the
                        elaboration of February this year on the two key problems in the
                        proposal.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That time the sentence
                        was so long.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We admit grammatically it is rather poor. Then the rest is about
                        our position on India/Pakistan. It comes after Japan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you mind if we break
                        this into sentences? Your whole section. This will help you. It won't help
                        us.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That will be alright. In the English we can change—keep the
                        semicolon. We will make another compromise. We will accept the semicolon to
                        four stops. But in Chinese we will stick to the four.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d102-11" facs="d102-11"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we will put a
                        period whenever there is a new subject. When you go from Vietnam to Korea,
                        we will make it a period and vice versa. It is really better reading, and
                        then when you go from Japan to India we will make a period. Let me go
                        through our section. We have substituted “ideologies” for “world outlook”.
                        We said ”… be willing to compete peacefully …” “Countries should treat each
                        other with mutual respect and be willing to compete peacefully … .”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: There is no need for us to change the Chinese there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me read you what I
                        have on Vietnam. “The United States stated that the peoples of Indochina
                        should be allowed to determine their destiny without outside intervention;
                        its constant primary objective has been a negotiated solution; its
                        eight-point proposal of January 25, 1972, represents a just basis for the
                        attainment of that objective; in the absence of a negotiated settlement the
                        United States envisages the ultimate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the
                        region consistent with the aim of self-determination for each country of
                        Indochina.” Alright.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That, of course, was put in because much of …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but for two
                        reasons. Because, one, when we were here in October we did not have public
                        proposal and therefore we could not reply and, in addition, now you have
                        mentioned both the seven-point proposal and the two problems, so we put it
                        in to balance.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I understand. Tentatively, let us put it in that fashion, but we
                        still have to consider it further because in ours we made no comment on that
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can support our own
                        proposal. This is what makes it different. I understand you accept it
                        tentatively, subject to a possible discussion.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And now let me read this American statement in total.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I reserve some
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Let's go on.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are willing to say
                        “it has put forward its eight-point proposal of January 25 for the
                        attainment of that objective”—something like that.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d102-12" facs="d102-12"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That would be better.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we say its “constant
                        primary objective has been a negotiated solution on a just basis - it has
                        put forward its proposal in order to attain its objectives”—and then we
                        don't characterize those objectives.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You have too many adjectives—true self-determination.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't mind taking out
                        “true.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Never put both “just basis” and “true.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't mind
                        eliminating “true”, but I do feel we have to characterize what we are trying
                        to do. “Its constant primary objective has been a negotiated
                        settlement.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And there should be no difficulty there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have a slightly
                        subjective view.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao :Then I am willing for you to point out that subjectivity.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to explain to
                        our people. You are supporting a seven-point proposal which is extremely
                        critical of us. It uses many unflattering adjectives. Therefore we have to
                        assume you support these unflattering adjectives also. This is a statement
                        of our position.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We could have said a “fair and reasonable” seven-point
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we said “reasonable”
                        rather than “just”, could that help you? I don't mind taking out “true.” Let
                        me make this suggestion. We could say “its objective has been a just
                        negotiated solution” and then we would say “represents a basis”—we drop the
                        word “just”—we don't characterize our eight-point, proposal as such.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We are being restrained. 'Express firm support of Vietnam, Laos
                        and Cambodia in their efforts”—no adjective and no adjective to characterize
                        the seven-point proposal. And if adjectives are to be added to the statement
                        of both sides it will become quite cumbersome. We will consider it.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d102-13" facs="d102-13"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's both consider it.
                        We will put a bracket around it. “The U.S. side stated that peace in Asia
                        and peace in the world required efforts both to reduce immediate tensions
                        and to eliminate the basic causes of conflict. The United States will work
                        for a just and secure peace: just because it fulfills the aspirations of
                        peoples and nations for freedom and progress, secure because it removes the
                        danger of foreign aggression. The United States supports individual freedom
                        and social progress for all the peoples of the world, free of outside
                        pressure or intervention. The United States believes that the effort to
                        reduce tension is served by improving communication between countries that
                        have different ideologies so as to lessen the risks of confrontation through
                        accident, miscalculation or misunderstanding. Countries should treat each
                        other with mutual respect and be willing to compete peacefully, letting
                        performance be the ultimate judge. No country should claim infallibility and
                        each country should be prepared to reexamine its own attitudes for the
                        common good. The United States stated that the peoples of Indochina should
                        be allowed to determine their destiny without outside intervention; its
                        constant primary objective has been a negotiated solution; its eight-point
                        proposal of January 25, 1972, represents a [just] basis…</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Our idea is adjectives should all be deleted.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “and was put forward
                        for the attainment of that objective.” Has been put forward—just—negotiated
                        solution. “The eight-point proposal has been put forward for the attainment
                        of that objective.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “It has put forward its eight-point proposal for the attainment of
                        that objective.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we can say “just
                        negotiated solution” then I will be glad to say “has been put forward for
                        the attainment of that objective.” It doesn't characterize what we have
                        done. We leave the word 'Just” with “negotiated.” Instead of saying—we will
                        say “has been put forward for the attainment of that objective.” Two
                        versions. “Its constant primary objective has been a negotiated solution;
                        its eight-point proposal of January 25, 1972 represents a basis for the
                        attainment of that objective.”</p>
                    <p>Then as an alternative: “Its constant primary objective has been a just
                        negotiated solution; its eight point proposal of January 25, 1972 has been
                        put forward for the attainment of that objective.”</p>
                    <p>Your point is we should drop the word altogether or put it just before
                        negotiated. That's what I prefer.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d102-14" facs="d102-14"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: First point is not to have the word “just.” There will be a lot of
                        work in Hangchow, and on the plane, or you, too, will be unemployed. I have
                        additional information for you. We'll talk on Vietnam …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Don't prolong the
                        discussion just for the pleasure of talking to me.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: … First, “its constant primary objective has been a negotiated
                        solution; its 8-point proposal of January 25, 1972 represents a basis for
                        the attainment of that objective.”</p>
                    <p>Second, “its constant primary objective has been a just negotiated solution;
                        its 8-point proposal of January 25, 1972, has been put forward for the
                        attainment of that objective.</p>
                    <p>The question here is simple. I would suggest we put brackets around it and
                        have both versions—only a question of maintaining the word “just.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As I understand it,
                        there are two versions. One is to have a just negotiated solution in which
                        Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> suggests that we say “the eight-point
                        proposal has been put forward for the purpose of achieving that
                        objective”—“represents a basis for the attainment of that objective.” If we
                        retain the word “just,” it determines the second sentence.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We will have two versions typed out.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “In the absence of a
                        negotiated settlement, the United States envisages the ultimate withdrawal
                        of all U.S. forces from the region consistent with the aim of
                        self-determination for each country of Indochina. The existing commitments
                        between the United States and the Republic of Korea will be honored; the
                        United States will support efforts of the Republic of Korea to seek a
                        relaxation of the tension and increased communication in the Korean
                        peninsula. The United States places the highest value on its friendly
                        relations with Japan, and it will continue to honor its mutual defense
                        treaty obligations. The United States supports the right of the peoples of
                        South Asia to shape their own future in peace and free of military threat;
                        it supports progress to fulfill the aspirations of all the nations of the
                        subcontinent without having the area become the subject of great power
                        rivalry.”</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d102-15" facs="d102-15"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You don't plan to add any more to that?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can probably say “it
                        supports adherence to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution
                        calling for the withdrawal of troops to …”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It is up to you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Can we keep it open
                        tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It is up to you. We will just type this part. On the following
                        paragraph there seems to be nothing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We may add a sentence
                        to India/Pakistan, and we will discuss that tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That will be for you to decide. We have nothing on the following
                        paragraph. Do you have any suggestions?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I would like to
                        raise again the issue that I raised with you before, whether we should not
                        say “our people are prepared” or whether we say “will prepare.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: In that way of putting it the difficulty will not lie on our side
                        but with your side, because just before that there is the question that
                        involves Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we have a separate
                        section on Taiwan which explains our position.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But in your explanation on Taiwan you only put forward an ultimate
                        objective and that ultimate objective has not been realized.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Prepare” means we want
                        to create a condition to realize it. Can we say “the United States and China
                        have renounced the use or threat of force in their international
                        disputes?”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We discussed it before. I don't think we need to go into this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I don't know what
                        we are saying.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d102-16" facs="d102-16"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We had already said we wish to reduce the danger of international
                        military conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand that. But
                        what are we saying? Are we going to apply these principles or are we
                        not?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We are laying the ground for implementation of these principles.
                        For instance, we now still have no state relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is nothing in the
                        five principles of coexistence that says we must have state relations.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Five principles—your maintaining your treaty with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> cannot be said to be
                        consistent. So I think that this wording which has been discussed so many
                        times should be maintained. We do very much like to use that wording, and we
                        are making an effort so in the future we will be able to use it. The
                        difficulty is not on our side. It is you who have sent the force of arms to
                        Taiwan. For instance, your people—you cannot answer to that because you have
                        not removed the use of force. So it is only a question of solving it
                        progressively. It is clear, so I don't think there need be any more
                        discussion on this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I am not.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: For instance, if this Taiwan question had been settled by now, to
                        withdraw all your armed forces, there would be no question but to have you
                        withdraw them. This matter we have been discussing for more than a decade
                        and the fact is you are there and the fact is you do have your armed forces
                        on our territory and that military presence on our territory is a violation
                        of …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Two questions. How will
                        this be interpreted? In 1955 the People's Republic was prepared to sign a
                        treaty for the renunciation of force. The only reason it failed was because
                        we insisted this apply to Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It was not so simple as you described it. We will discuss this in
                        more detail on the plane tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On December 1, 1955 you
                        made the proposal that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should settle disputes between our two
                        countries through peaceful <pb n="17" xml:id="d102-17" facs="d102-17"/>solution without the use of force. And we said does this apply to Taiwan?
                        You said Taiwan is an internal matter which China is willing to settle by
                        peaceful means. We raised the issue that this is without prejudice to the
                        collective right of self-defense. This you did not accept.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: But here you only touch the surface of the problem. You did not
                        touch the roots of the problem, that is, the premise of your putting forward
                        your suggested joint declaration and an inevitability of putting forward
                        that joint declaration is that you would agree to withdraw from Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That was never put
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: There is not much time tonight, but I can tell you the whole story
                        tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am less interested in
                        that story than I am in what exactly we are saying here.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I am trying to say we are working towards that goal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not clear that
                        this applies to Taiwan. We recognize you do not consider Taiwan an
                        international dispute.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The trouble is there are American troops stationed in Taiwan. We
                        had always maintained that there are two aspects to the Taiwan question. One
                        is that it is an internal matter between the Chinese. The other aspect of
                        the Taiwan question is you have your armed forces there and that constitutes
                        an international dispute between the U.S. and China. We are willing to bring
                        an end to the international dispute between the U.S. and China. We are
                        willing to bring an end to the international dispute between our two
                        countries—you withdraw your forces. You cannot say you are not using your
                        armed forces when you have them stationed there. You said, if they would ask
                        you has there been an agreement between China and the U.S., you cannot say
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If one said, yes, one
                        would have to add the People's Republic does not consider Taiwan an
                        international dispute and therefore this restriction does not apply to
                        Taiwan.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="d102-18" facs="d102-18"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is not correct. Taiwan is a part of China. We should not
                        reach agreement on this. What both of our sides have been saying—with
                        relations suspended for more than 20 years—let us admit errors and move in
                        that direction. The direction is to merely put into implementation those
                        principles mentioned above.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The President may want
                        to discuss this.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “There are essential differences between China and the United
                        States in their social systems and foreign policies. However, the two sides
                        agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct
                        their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and
                        territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
                        equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. International
                        disputes should be settled on this basis, without resorting to the use or
                        threat of force. The United States and the People's Republic of China are
                        prepared to apply these principles to their mutual relations.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Alright.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And then the following paragraph. “It would be against the
                        interests of the peoples of the world for any major country to collude with
                        another against other countries, or for major countries to divide up the
                        world into spheres of interest.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I suggest we take
                        out the word “major”; then it will apply to minor countries. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It is not realistic to think that a small country can divide the
                        world into spheres of interest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you not in fear of
                        Arab countries making a sphere of interest against Israel?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Let's not go into any discussion on that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “With these principles of international relations in mind the two
                        sides stated—no change.”—Progress toward the normalization of relations
                        between China and the United States is in the interests of all
                        countries;—both wish to reduce the danger of international military
                        conflict.”</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d102-19" facs="d102-19"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was going to make a
                        suggestion here. I think “wish” is a very weak word. “Make efforts to reduce
                        the danger of international military conflict.” “Wish” is a weak word.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Because that is not conforming to
                        reality.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It will not happen
                        unless we make an effort.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: With the word “wish” that does not hinder you from making your
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But it is not a word
                        that does justice to two great peoples.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We made so many concessions to you. As the Premier said, if we
                        don't show clear restraint.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But this is no
                        concession to the U.S.—what do we get out of it?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We wish to maintain the word “wish.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You don't even wish to
                        discuss it?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We have such big differences. Of course, we may have further
                        discussion of this wording. We suggest, however, to keep it as it is. I am
                        quite capable of talking at great length.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we are not trying
                        to wear each other out. We are trying to get a good document.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That is right. As you joked the other day, you hoped I would not
                        deal with you as I dealt with Malik. We are striving to approach each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Will you discuss this
                        point with the Prime Minister?</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="d102-20" facs="d102-20"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: If you express that wish, we can do it. The next is—the whole
                        document will have to be referred to your President and our Prime Minister
                        subject to their approval. Third, “neither will seek hegemony in the
                        Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or
                        group of countries to establish such hegemony; and—neither is prepared to
                        negotiate on behalf of any third party or to enter into agreements or
                        understandings directed at other states.” There is lack of clarity. We can
                        say “neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to
                        enter into”—what is the agreement between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Japan and your treaty with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is why I think we
                        should say “to enter into agreements or understandings with the other
                        directed at other states.” “Neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of
                        any third party or to enter into agreements or understandings with the other
                        directed at other states.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Okay, it is more clear.</p>
                    <p>“The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious disputes between China and
                        the United States. The Chinese side reaffirmed its position: The Taiwan
                        question is the crucial question obstructing the normalization of relations
                        between China and the United States; the Government of the People's Republic
                        of China is the sole legal Government of China; Taiwan is a province of
                        China which has long been returned to the motherland; the liberation of
                        Taiwan is China's internal affair in which no other country has the right to
                        interfere; and all U.S. forces and military installations must be withdrawn
                        from Taiwan. The Chinese Government firmly opposes any activities which aim
                        at the creation of 'one China, one Taiwan,' 'one China, two governments,'
                        'two Chinas,' and “independent Taiwan' or advocate that 'the status of
                        Taiwan remains to be determined.”</p>
                    <p>Then the U.S. side. “The U.S. side declared: The United States acknowledges
                        that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but
                        one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government
                        does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in the peaceful
                        settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves. With this
                        prospect in mind, it affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all
                        U.S. forces and military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, it will
                        progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the
                        tension in the area diminishes.”</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It makes no sense in
                        English.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You have trapped me.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, not yet.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Shall I continue? “The two sides agreed that, it is desirable to
                        broaden the understanding between the two peoples. To this end, they
                        discussed specific areas in the fields of science, technology, culture,
                        sports and journalism, in which people-to-people contacts and exchanges
                        would be mutually beneficial.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you people lose one
                        game in the U.S., I will know you have instructed them.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “Each side undertakes to facilitate the further development of
                        such contacts and exchanges.”</p>
                    <p>“Both sides view bilateral trade as another area from which mutual benefit
                        could be derived, and agreed that economic relations based on equality and
                        mutual benefit are in the interests of the peoples of the two countries.
                        They agreed to facilitate the progressive development of trade between their
                        two countries.”</p>
                    <p>“The two sides agreed that they will stay in contact through various
                        channels. In addition, the U.S. Government will send a senior representative
                        to Peking from time to time for concrete consultations to further the
                        normalization of relations between the two countries and continue to
                        exchange views on issues of common interest.</p>
                    <p>“The two sides expressed the hope that the gains achieved during this visit
                        would open up new prospects for the relations between the two
                        countries.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I make a
                        suggestion—that repeats—may I say progress of the … “open up new
                        prospects.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “They believe that the normalization of relations of the two
                        countries is not only in the interest of the two peoples but …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The first of the
                        two.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d102-22" facs="d102-22"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Progress towards the relations of China and the U.S. is in the
                        interest of all countries. A little bit of difference. In the principles, it
                        is progress towards normalization—here it is the normalization. If you put
                        various channels before a stop, that is something not agreed to by both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now we have a practical
                        problem. We will get this typed up tonight, and we will have a copy on the
                        plane. Now the question is we would like to tell Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and him alone. What do you think? It
                        is almost essential.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I know this is your problem and one we respect. But as you know,
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> shows great
                        concern on matters of that, and we have to report to him on that first. Your
                        wish is to show it to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                        now?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, not now. Tomorrow.
                        He will have to defend it before Congress. But we will not show it to anyone
                        else.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: As the Premier said to you this afternoon—we would say we reached
                        some agreements, and we might work out a Communique.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can say we might
                        work out a Communique, but then we have to be prepared to tell the press
                        there will be a Communique.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: The fact is that the President and the Prime Minister may still
                        want to have some changes here and there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How is the seating
                        arrangement on the plane? Will we sit together?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We will be together. We can discuss this. No matter how we
                        arranged it, we can sit together.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then I suggest I will
                        give Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> a copy after we
                        reach Hangchow and that we not discuss it on the plane.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I approve.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And then we will give
                        it to him as soon as we arrive in Hangchow, and you and I can have private
                        discussions anyway. You <pb n="23" xml:id="d102-23" facs="d102-23"/>will
                        find out from the Prime Minister with respect to the various points we
                        raise, and I will find out various points you raised with the President, and
                        then we will put it in final shape.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I approve. The scheduling for Shanghai is very tight.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will get it finished
                        tomorrow afternoon.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Or in the evening. We must finish in Hangchow. Then the procedure
                        will be as follows. Tomorrow, we will read it through in Hangchow and check
                        it, and after that we still will have to send it for approval by the Prime
                        Minister and the President.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will submit to the
                        President what we have, just to make some progress.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao Certainly. Even after we do it once, we still have to submit it. We
                        have just obtained instructions that if you want to show it to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> that can be decided by
                        your President himself. We have no objections.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will show it to him
                        in Hangchow.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Another thing—“also taking part in the discussions were so and
                        so"— whether you have it or not have it is really up to you and we will list
                        or not list accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will dispense with
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: I think we ought to take
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> out of it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is his last trip
                        (laughter).</p>

                    <p>After brief amenities Prime Minister thou asked whether the President had
                        anything he wished to say at this point.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that long talks have been held bilaterally both at the
                        summit and between the Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister
                        concerning problems of interest to the whole world. This has been necessary
                        in order for us to find common ground. The important thing is that we
                        reflect honestly the substance of these talks, and that we avoid diplomatic
                        doubletalk. We have been honest and candid. If we can continue on that basis
                        we have a solid foundation on which to build for the future. The President
                        asked whether the Prime Minister had anything further to add.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the discussions at both levels had indeed been
                        proceeding as the President indicated. Both sides have set forth differences
                        in principles, but we have also been able to find common ground. We have
                        also agreed that we will declare to the peoples of both our sides, and to
                        the world, both our differences and our common round. In this way we will
                        break through some of the usual diplomatic conventions. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> have a characteristic in common: they do
                        away with the superfluous.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in the discussions we had come to the point very
                        quickly.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister agreed, saying, why should we cover up our differences? If
                        we show to the peoples of our two countries the truth, and show it to the
                        world, we shall have a new style of work. At first, people may not be able
                        to accept this, but it will come to be viewed as a good way of dealing. It
                        would not be good to feed illusions to the world or to our two peoples.</p>
                    <p>The President said that we do have differences, and we cannot build a bridge
                        spanning l6,000 miles and 23 years in one week. Nevertheless, we have found
                        more common ground than we anticipated. The world wants to find that these
                        two great nations do have common ground.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d103-03" facs="d103-03"/>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the President's statement, “We cannot build a
                        bridge spanning 16,000 miles and 23 years in one week” would make a good
                        poem. He added that we have at least taken the first step in a long march of
                        10,000 miles.</p>
                    <p>The President observed, however, that we must not take 10,000 years for that
                        march. The Prime Minister agreed that would be too long.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked whether the Secretary wished to make any
                        observations. The Secretary said he was sure the Foreign Minister would
                        agree that their talks had been conducted in the same spirit as those at the
                        summit: they were frank, but never unfriendly. In these talks it was agreed
                        that in order to build a bridge or take a long march together we must have
                        contact. He had indicated that we were prepared to carry on contacts in a
                        manner which the Chinese found most suitable under existing
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister interjected, “Suitable to both sides.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the talks had also helped clear up a number of
                        misunderstandings, for instance concerning the matter of a requirement for
                        fingerprinting of some visitors to the United States. The Chinese had
                        indicated that this was an unacceptable procedure, for historical reasons.
                        (Feudal landlords had required fingerprinting of tenants.) In less than ten
                        minutes a phone call to Washington had confirmed our understanding that
                        fingerprinting was no longer required. The President said he believed that
                        this practice had been stopped during the time when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> was serving as Attorney General. The
                        Prime Minister said that was to his credit. The Secretary said that the
                        phone call had demonstrated how quickly misunderstandings could be cleared
                        up when there was a means of fast and frequent communication. The Secretary
                        concluded with an expression of appreciation to our Chinese hosts, saying
                        that in every possible way this had been a most pleasant and unforgettable
                        visit.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d103-04" facs="d103-04"/>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that in some ways they had not done enough. There
                        were shortcomings. During the visit to the Great Wall, and the Ming Tombs,
                        for instance, there was a serious problem. It was quite unnecessary to put
                        on a false show of children dancing along the route of the President at the
                        Ming Tombs. The American press had pointed this out. We have admonished our
                        people who did this. We had not known previously of this. In the spirit of
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>, we are determined not to
                        cover up our errors. This was a simple thing, but it was bad. It is right to
                        admit our wrongs; but we will not, of course, admit to having done wrong
                        when we have done no wrong. Only in this way is it possible for us to
                        control bur bureaucracy; but this is not easy. The Prime Minister then
                        laughed and said, “But I have been talking too much.” He wondered whether
                        Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei had anything to say.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that he was in full agreement with the opinions
                        expressed by the Secretary. The general atmosphere had been characterized by
                        friendliness. Both sides adopted an attitude of looking forward in a
                        positive spirit in order to improve our relations. In the attempt to find
                        common ground we had reviewed history and touched on the differences of
                        opinions and of principles which we have had in the past. In order to make a
                        good start in the normalization of our relations both sides discussed some
                        concrete issues as well as general principles. We discussed how to move
                        forward in people-to-people exchanges in the fields of sports, science,
                        medicine, culture and education. We also considered trade relations, which
                        we believed would be helpful in promoting the normalization of relations. We
                        reached a meeting of minds concerning the initial, beginning steps in trade.
                        We also reached the common view that before relations are normalized it
                        would be better for the above matters to be conducted on a people-to-people
                        basis, with governmental facilitation. It was also the common view that
                        these matters should be developed gradually and progressively. Ten thousand
                        years are too long, but to take this long march in one year is too short.
                        Still, we must “seize the day, seize the hour.” The Secretary and the
                        Foreign Minister would be primarily responsible to see that these programs
                        were carried out.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d103-05" facs="d103-05"/>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to make a point which was very important
                        for our future relationship. The Prime Minister had been very forthright
                        concerning the press story about the little girls dancing. The President
                        only wanted to say that he hoped no one would be reprimanded for the
                        incident, because he liked it. The incident nevertheless does illustrate how
                        misunderstandings could poison our relations. We must make every effort to
                        prevent this.</p>
                    <p>The President said that all agree that this is the story of the century.
                        There will be much comment. Newsmen consider that they are experts and have
                        the right to express their opinions. Members of Congress, too, have the
                        right to make statements freely, without consulting with us. For instance,
                        there was a story yesterday that the President had made the decision to
                        recognize Bangladesh at a certain time. We are considering this step, but I
                        have not made a decision. There will be stories by columnists and statements
                        by politicians. Many people abroad will consider these to be
                        authoritative.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning we have developed between ourselves at the highest levels
                        a spirit of mutual trust. <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Ayub Khan</persName>
                        once said to me, “Trust is like a thin thread: once it breaks, it is hard to
                        put it together again.” It is important that all of us recognize that when
                        statements are made in the future, the Prime Minister and the Chinese
                        Government should realize that until the President or the Secretary, or some
                        authorized person speaks, it is not the position of our government. We
                        cannot control what others will say, but we will be honest in our
                        statements, as we have been in our discussions here.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized that what the President had just said was most
                        important. He would appreciate it if, when there is any misunderstanding,
                        the Foreign Minister would get in touch with him. He said he had many
                        foreign ministers who simply picked up the phone and called him. If we could
                        have a way to communicate quickly, we could straighten things out by keeping
                        in touch.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d103-06" facs="d103-06"/>
                    <p>The President said he would like to state that never in his term of office
                        had we talked with a government which had been more meticulous and
                        trustworthy in our communications. There had been absolutely no leaks. This
                        is very important to our relations, which must progress on this basis. We
                        have been criticized because we on our side have not kept the press
                        informed. We have so acted because this was the understanding which we had
                        with the Prime Minister. The rule which we want our people to understand is
                        that this great step we have made will never be served by the headline we
                        make today, but by the history we make tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that was quite right. For communication be more
                        accurate, it must be accomplished directly with the President, the
                        Secretary, or with anyone whom they authorize to communicate. This is
                        necessary in order for the general public opinion to accept what is correct
                        but not pay attention to that which is wrong. We should also like everyone
                        to know that socialist China can stand-up to criticism. If we are wrong, we
                        can correct it.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister observed that there were still two days in which to
                        finalize the communique. He hoped that the remaining talks would continue to
                        be productive.</p>
                    <p>The President said that soon we would have to answer press questions. He said
                        that up to now he had only “not talked about the weather.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he thought all had been impressed with the progress
                        made so far. He hoped that progress which had been so successfully started
                        would continue.</p>
                    <p>Both the President and the Secretary expressed their sincere appreciation for
                        the hospitality which the Chinese had shown them and their party in Peking.
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="d103-07" facs="d103-07"/>The Prime Minister thanked
                        them, but said that the Chinese had not done enough. They should have made
                        more effort.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister suggested that the President allow Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZRL1">Ziegler</persName> to tell the press that this final
                        plenary meeting of the Peking phase of the President's visit had been
                        held.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese and American parties then proceeded to their planes for the
                        flight to Hangchow.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Hangchow Hotel, Hangchow</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Vice Minister,
                        should I start?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As you know, as I told
                        you yesterday, we were going to give this draft today to the Secretary of
                        State and I want to talk to you frankly. We do not need his approval to
                        execute a communique and in normal circumstances we make these decisions
                        regardless of the views of individual Cabinet members. In this particular
                        case, we have not achieved our full objective if we do not succeed in
                        mobilizing public opinion behind the policy we are trying to pursue. So,
                        while normally we can easily survive comments from officials which are
                        critical, in this particular case we can survive them but it will get us
                        into side issues and the Minister must have seen when he was in the United
                        States during the India-Pakistan crisis how a mutinous bureaucracy can get
                        its views to the public. So we would like to gain not his acquiescence but
                        his strong support by letting him get a sense of having done something to
                        the communique. Now he has <pb n="2" xml:id="d104-02" facs="d104-02"/>three
                        suggestions on the crucial paragraph on Taiwan and I will just put them and
                        then let us see how much we can do.</p>
                    <p>In the first sentence where it says “The United States acknowledges … “ The
                        argument is that all sounds a little ridiculous in English. So we would
                        suggest not saying “all Chinese” but “the Chinese.” It's in English makes
                        almost no difference, and in Chinese it may even translate the same way. I
                        don't know.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>, “all” means “so yu” (Chinese
                        word).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: It is stronger, but the
                        difference is not all that great.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: His argument is that it
                        sounds silly for us to say “all” and that it sounds excessive for us to say
                        that. We say “all” Chinese but we can say “the Chinese” which in English
                        means almost the same thing.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That's one point. Now you
                        will please continue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't want to give
                        you the impression that there is wild enthusiasm on his part for the whole
                        paragraph. He wants to say instead of “does not challenge that position,”
                        “does not challenge this.” And the third point—the last point in this
                        paragraph—is he does not like “by the Chinese themselves” in the next
                        sentence and he makes the same point as the President made: “on both sides
                        of the Straits” or something like that. That's all in this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Then there's an issue at the beginning that is raised. We would like to
                        propose at the beginning—as it is now, after the introduction, you state,
                        your position and we state ours. We propose that you state your position in
                        the Chinese text first and we state our position in the English text
                        first.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Anything more?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One other point. All I
                        am now mentioning are minor things. We have a sentence for the ceasefire
                        line in India, for example, which I don't think is a problem.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Would you kindly give it to
                        us?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, We would say the
                        following: “Consistent with the United Nations Security Council resolution
                        of December 21, 1972, the United States favors the continuation of the
                        ceasefire of the south Asian sub-continent and the withdrawal of all
                        military forces to within their own territory and to the pre-war line in
                        Jainmu and Kashmir.”</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d104-03" facs="d104-03"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Pre-war line. That's rather
                        vague.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's say ceasefire
                        line. The trouble with that is which ceasefire line?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: When it says ceasefire line
                        in Jammu and Kashmir then the connotation is clear.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, Let's say
                        that.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That is immediately
                        following what you presented yesterday?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We had had it at the
                        beginning of that sentence. We would shift the sentence around. And then it
                        would be a semicolon after this and it would be followed by what we had,
                        which we have shortened a little bit.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Anything more?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, this last point
                        is our . . no, we have one other problem and that's really the last one
                        except for word suggestions here and there. Not to waste time, the argument
                        was made that by listing commitments to two countries and not saying
                        anything about a general attitude toward commitment we are acting
                        ambiguously toward countries like the Philippines, and Thailand, and
                        therefore should have a sentence in there which says that the United States
                        will maintain its commitments … . If we can say the United States will
                        maintain its existing commitments, then we would take it out with regard to
                        Japan and Korea and put in some other words. What we would then do … You
                        see, it's also a problem for you because supposing we say these two, then
                        every other ally in the whole Pacific will say “what about us?” and we will
                        have to be issuing statements every day.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I cannot make any immediate
                        reaction to that suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we would then take
                        out “the existing commitments between Korea and the United States will be
                        honored.” We would not use the word “commitment” twice and we would also
                        take it out of Japan.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d104-04" facs="d104-04"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I can't immediately give an
                        answer to that. If you were to say that it will be very obvious that first
                        of all you will include your commitment to <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't want to bargain
                        about this because I understand your problem.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We pointed out our position
                        and you yours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You don't have to argue
                        it because I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: The interests of our two
                        sides, the positions of the two sides, are quite clear to each other.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will make the
                        following suggestion. We will rewrite the section on Korea and Japan so the
                        commitment is not mentioned, so there won't be questions why you make
                        commitments to them and not to others. That you can't object to.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Well indeed there are so
                        many countries in the world with whom you have treaty commitments.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would say, for
                        example, not the final language but just to give you a sense of what we
                        would say, instead of “existing commitments between the U.S. and the
                        Republic of Korea” we would say “the U.S. will maintain its close ties and
                        support for the Republic of Korea.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “And support?”</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): “Will maintain its close ties and
                        support?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Please repeat.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Will maintain its
                        close ties and support for the Republic of Korea.”</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d104-05" facs="d104-05"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Anything more?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And then in this
                        sentence … “the U.S. places the highest value on its …” we would take out
                        “honor its mutual defense treaty obligations” and put in something else,
                        “continue to place the highest value on its friendship with Japan and
                        continue to strengthen the existing close relationship.” So no defense
                        treaty; we haven't mentioned the defense treaty.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Any more?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, many of these we
                        will get when we go through the text. I have one</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Question whether the Vietnam
                        part, what is a just basis …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Have you a
                        suggestion?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So we maintain our original
                        position that neither side use any adjective.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are going to drop
                        “firm support” then?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It's not an adjective, “firm
                        support.” What I mean is we shouldn't spend too much energy on.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Its constant primary
                        objective has been the peaceful solution …” What we want to say there to be
                        precise, the eight-point proposal put forward by the Republic of Vietnam and
                        the United States on January 25.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That's fact.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Factual. As long as we
                        are giving you changes like this, I have one which is at the very end.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Repeat this sentence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “It's constant primary
                        objective has been a negotiated solution; the eight-point proposal put
                        forward by … represents a basis for the attainment of that objective.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It's clear. Anything
                        more?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. “The two sides
                        agreed”—at the end—“that they will stay in contact through various
                        channels.” Instead of saying the United States Government will send a senior
                        representative, this sounds like we have made an obligation to you, so what
                        we want to say is “through various channels, including the sending of a
                        senior U.S. representative to Peking.” Other things we will get as we go
                        through. When it is a word, do you want every last suggestion now?</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d104-06" facs="d104-06"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: When it is a purely
                        technical, stylistic matter, it doesn't matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: From the point of view
                        of vanity, we favor taking out “also taking part in the discussion” and
                        “also taking part in the talks.” In the part where it says this, could we
                        also mention that the Secretary of State, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName>, and Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei also
                        had a useful talk? It's a minor point. If it gives you any trouble forget
                        it, It's not worth a lot of effort.</p>
                    <p>I have one point which is a point of logic. On our page … on page 5 of this
                        document, … he just explains to me that what I had in mind isn't going to be
                        possible. That sentence, “it is against the interest …” We agree with it.
                        Just logically it isn't listed among the general principles, and isn't
                        listed among agreements. It's just put there between the principles and
                        agreements and my suggestion is that it should be moved into one or the
                        other. I think it's not substantive; it's a drafting suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Another possibility is … which requires less worry—it's less elegant, is that
                        we begin the sentence by saying “The two sides also agreed that it is
                        against the best interest…” That may be the easiest and really all.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: The questions which you
                        raised are things which we will have to study.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I recognize it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: A 15-minute recess?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly. I want to
                        repeat to the Vice Foreign Minister, this is not a clever negotiating trick
                        on our part.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We really think if some
                        of these points could be made, it would help us achieve the objective.</p>
                    <p>BREAK—11:00 -11:28 p.m.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d104-07" facs="d104-07"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Before expressing our views
                        on the suggestions you made, I would like first of all to say that
                        considering the present stage already reached in discussing the communique
                        there are a few minor points which we feel our part would like to put
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That is, on the four points
                        of common positions of the two sides. That is on these four points, the
                        first point concerns the question of normalization of relations; the second
                        is on the reduction of danger of international military conflict, and the
                        third is on the question of opposition to hegemony. On this third point, we
                        did not quite make our position quite clear yesterday. We wanted to change
                        the words “will seek” to “neither side should seek hegemony.” But in
                        interpreting, my interpretation was not accurate.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But what is the
                        difference in meaning that you are trying to convey?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Of course there is a
                        difference between “will” and “should” because Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s English is better than
                        ours.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But your subtlety
                        exceeds mine.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: No, your subtlety exceeds
                        mine. Quite to the contrary, it is not to be subtle that we want this word.
                        It is to make it perfectly clear that whether you do want or do not want it
                        that you should not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In principle I am
                        disposed to go along with you, but the question in my mind is that if you
                        say neither will, then you are committed. If you say neither should then you
                        are expressing a general moral proposition which may or may not be carried
                        out.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Well, then we said “with
                        this principle of international relations in mind” we used the word
                        “should,” for instance “disputes should be settled on this basis” and “the
                        two sides agreed that … . should … .”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But the previous one
                        expresses general principles, but this one expresses definite action.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: No, that's not the case. For
                        instance, when we talk about progress toward normalization of relations,
                        what action has been taken? It's only a direction.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d104-08" facs="d104-08"/>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: Apart from that, the
                        first sentence of the statement is merely a statement: “Both sides are of
                        the view that it is in the interest …” This is merely a judgment.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Neither will seek”—is
                        that too weak or too strong for you?</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: According to the exact
                        implication of our Chinese version, the word ying kai should be interpreted
                        as “should” and not “will.” Of course we understand somewhat about a
                        legalistic language, but don't want to debate much of that now. So if you
                        feel that as the Vice Minister was saying, we were very frank with you and
                        it was a mistaken interpretation on my part. . if you don't agree then we
                        can debate on it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Supposing we put in
                        “should” and then someone asks me why this curious word is here. As I
                        understand it, you are trying to express a moral commitment that this should
                        not be done. In other words, you want to say more than “will.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It includes that
                        interpretation and accurately reflects the Chinese word “should.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's put it aside.
                        We'll solve this; it can be solved. We can perhaps say it—it is awkward in
                        English.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It's a very minor matter.
                        Then we go on to another, also a very small question. We don't have any
                        major points. That is our declaration on the Taiwan question. We have a
                        technical change and think you will understand when you hear it. It is a
                        matter of language because when we first put forward this draft our
                        statement on Taiwan, it was said … “and the U.S. troops must withdraw from
                        Taiwan.” We put it in Chinese, but it meant the U.S. must withdraw all its
                        forces and military installations from Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, of course.
                        Will you just give us your language? It's more poetic this way, but more
                        accurate the other.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName> “All U.S. forces and military
                        installations must be withdrawn from Taiwan.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. That's fine.
                        In fact, that's much more correct. You are absolutely right; no problem.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d104-09" facs="d104-09"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So that was what I was
                        originally intending to do tonight. To discuss technical and stylistic
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So was I, and we are
                        embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It is late evening on the
                        26th and this is to be published tomorrow. And this document was already
                        agreed upon by your highest leadership and our highest leadership. And if a
                        major change is to be suggested now, I think the consequences would be we
                        cannot publish it tomorrow. Because some of the questions raised are quite
                        serious. I want to discuss this matter with you and also want to reach
                        agreement with you, and after our discussion last night at the small hours I
                        believed then this question was already solved, and when I sent you off
                        early this morning I was relaxed thinking we had solved this. But I cannot
                        in a most frank way tell my colleagues; the questions you raised today
                        indeed put us in a very difficult position. And for some of the questions, I
                        don't think it is possible for them to be solved tomorrow. If you persist—of
                        course, you do have the right to persist—there is no question but you do
                        have the right to persist on an equal basis. So now, what after all, are
                        your intentions now?</p>
                    <p>For instance, your argument on the Taiwan wording, how long we have discussed
                        it. We have spent so much energy from your first visit in July; we spent so
                        much time on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And in our five days of
                        discussions in Peking our energies were primarily devoted to the Taiwan
                        question—and we didn't spend much time on any other question—because the
                        Taiwan question is indeed the crucial question between us.</p>
                    <p>I would like again to tell my colleague Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that what has characterized our relations has been
                        sincerity and frankness. And it is in this spirit that I want to say that we
                        cannot consider the suggested changes in the wording of this Taiwan case.
                        That originally is where we were. So you say you have difficulties. So we
                        went back then you advanced forward, and then you said an agreement is
                        reached and both of us were happy and then in the last five minutes you
                        raised it again and we cannot do it now.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d104-10" facs="d104-10"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Vice Foreign
                        Minister, I understand what you are saying. These difficulties rise from the
                        fact that I did not persist in my proposal to have Marshall Green present
                        because my colleagues do not know with what sincerity and anguish you have
                        worked, and the problems you have had. When I discuss your problems, they
                        ascribe it to my inadequacy rather than to anything else. I am speaking with
                        the frankness with which we speak to each other. And the reason I raise it
                        at all is to get their willing cooperation in defending it before the
                        Congress and our public.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Precisely. It is because we
                        want to take into account these reasons you advanced that we made concession
                        after concession on this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You did, I agree.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Your President personally
                        put forward a proposal yesterday and we asked for instructions from our
                        Prime Minister. Our Prime Minister accepted it. Now you want to change it;
                        that I cannot do. As you often said, and as the President often says, we
                        must establish mutual trust. If there is no such mutual trust what is the
                        sense of having this piece of paper? So Dr, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, I think the matter now is very serious. You have
                        pressed me to a corner. And now we attach great importance to this work and
                        have adopted a very positive and cooperative attitude in hoping to succeed
                        in this communique. Why is it that we do this? Because to do this conforms
                        to the needs of both sides, not just to the needs of one. Isn't that so?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: So I will reply to you very
                        clearly. If you persist in your position there will be no need for further
                        discussions tonight. And we will discuss it again tomorrow and the result
                        will be no communique. That is so because Chairman Mao had made it very
                        clear to Mr. Edgar Snow that it is our policy that it is all right whether
                        the meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is
                        successful or not. We will still consider this visit to be fruitful. But
                        please don't misunderstand. We still hope to have a communique. But I must
                        sincerely hope you will not persist in your suggestions. You know, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, the sentiments of all
                        Chinese are very strong on the Taiwan question. I am restraining myself to
                        the utmost. We have to do much work with our people to enable our people to
                        accept even this. So I am being most frank. If you feel you have to persist
                        in this, let us not continue tonight.</p>
                    <p>Why is it I agreed yesterday that you may tell the press there is a
                        communique? I thought we had solved our main problems. If I had not believed
                            <pb n="11" xml:id="d104-11" facs="d104-11"/>this I could not have let
                        you tell the press there would be a communique. You really put me in a
                        dilemma. I cannot agree. So I must sincerely hope you will reconsider.</p>
                    <p>If you feel that you need not persist in these suggestions then we may
                        continue our discussions tonight, Otherwise I suggest we recess. Of course,
                        whether it be a person, a nation or a state, if it is forced to a corner it
                        will resist. So what do you think? Everyone is very tired: We are very
                        tired; you are very tired. As I said, your suggestions on the Taiwan
                        question are unacceptable. All three are. Cannot be. Not a matter of words.
                        I can well make a long statement and I am able to make speeches.</p>
                    <p>Then, as for the suggestion about the order of the statements of the two
                        sides, we could consider, when you publish it whether it be English,
                        Chinese, or any other translation, you can put your statement first, and
                        when we publish it, whether in English, Chinese or any other translation,
                        our statement can come first.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's acceptable.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That we can consider. But I
                        still have to say with regard to this point too, I still have to report to
                        the Prime Minister and you have to report to the President. So the first
                        point, on the Taiwan case, we cannot agree to any of the three. The second
                        point, about order of statements, we may consider. The third point we find
                        we can agree, that is on having a clause on talks between the Secretary of
                        State and the Foreign Minister in accordance with the concerns you advanced,
                        and it also reflects a fact. Of course, on the one hand you do have your
                        difficulties here and also it's a fact.</p>
                    <p>And then the fourth is the question of the commitments. I am inclined to not
                        have any change. Because time is too late. And for any changes to be made
                        even in such cases, its rather difficult. Because I am being most frank with
                        you, that is for such a big change by you to be made in the communique, then
                        our Prime Minister will still have to consult leading personages of the
                        Central Committee and how can there be time for that? When you mentioned the
                        time for publishing of the communique, although at that time I hadn't
                        reported to the Prime Minister, but it was my feeling the Prime Minister's
                        spirit would be he is willing to consider what is most effective.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d104-12" facs="d104-12"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It makes no difference.
                        We can do it late tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: But if you are to make such
                        a major change, even though we are all still in China, it would be very
                        difficult. I can tell you that after our meeting at the small hours this
                        morning our government engaged in a very serious and earnest discussion on
                        this draft.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: This is the first
                        communique ever published between China and the United States. It is of
                        great importance.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am saying all this without
                        any reservations. So if you want to insist on such changes,then there is
                        that danger that there will be no guarantee as to whether there will be time
                        for itor not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Minister, I want to
                        speak to you with the same frankness with which you have spoken to me.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Let me finish.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, I thought you
                        had.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Then, as far as your
                        suggestion about “including the sending of a senior U.S. representative,” we
                        could agree to that. And then we can also agree to deleting that “taking
                        part in Chinese …” And then on your suggestion about the question of any
                        major country colluding with another I believe your suggestion is merely
                        from the point of view of structure. Isn't that so?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is right.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: This is a point which we
                        could of course consider. If it's only that question, I don't think the
                        problem is very big. So the question again is the crucial question, Taiwan.
                        Another major question is that of the commitments regarding Korea and Japan.
                        Now I would like to hear your views. I made my position clear and we do not
                        like to engage in senseless debates. We must be practical.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Minister, first of
                        all, I understand your position and I think it is reasonable on the issue of
                        Taiwan. I believe you have made major steps and as I pointed out, the
                        difficulty arises from the fact that unless people have been physically
                        present at the talks, a paragraph when <pb n="13" xml:id="d104-13" facs="d104-13"/>it is read cannot possibly reflect the anguish that went
                        into it, And I also recognize that Taiwan has special sensitivity to you and
                        therefore I can understand the intensity of your feelings. My motive in
                        raising these issues is to prevent what can become a very bitter debate in
                        America and to keep from happening what happened at the time of the
                        India-Pakistan crisis. A major department pursued a deliberate policy of
                        undermining our credibility. However, considering the fact that you did give
                        me the opportunity to take this document to the President myself, I believe
                        perhaps I should not persist in the proposal on Taiwan. I must tell you
                        frankly, the advantage to us of substituting the word “the” for “all” is so
                        out of proportion to the meaning that I simply want to mention it, but I can
                        see that I should not persist in it.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: I don't agree to that,
                        but don't want to debate with you at this moment. I don't want to waste time
                        now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, on the other
                        point, there I feel frankly your position is not so reasonable. Because we
                        have not in effect made a serious effort to correct your statements on your
                        version. We are not changing the sense of what we are saying.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Let me interrupt a moment.
                        The reason for the interruption is to make clear my position. That is to say
                        most frankly, unless on this point you are able to give us right away an
                        explicit wording, otherwise I fear very much.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we will give you an
                        explicit wording now.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Then let us put this
                        question aside.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will give you an
                        explicit wording this minute. On Korea we will say: “The United States will
                        maintain its close ties with and support for the Republic of Korea.” That is
                        all we will say here and then semicolon, “The United States will support
                        efforts …” This is negotiated. Next when we talk about Japan, “The U.S.
                        places the highest value on its friendly relations with Japan; it will
                        continue to strengthen the existing close bonds.”</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): And then South Asia?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And then the South Asia
                        clause?</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d104-14" facs="d104-14"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, let me read you.
                        “Consistent with the United Nations Security Council resolution of December
                        21, 1971, the United States favors the continuation of the ceasefire in the
                        South Asian subcontinent and the withdrawal of all military forces to within
                        their own territories, and to the ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmire; the
                        United States supports the right of the peoples of South Asia to shape their
                        own future in peace, free of military threat and without having the area
                        become the subject of great power rivalry,” Just stylistic, no substantive
                        change.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You wish to put it this way
                        in your statement?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: There is nothing very strong
                        here, any strong views here. That is, with the exception of mentioning the
                        December 21 resolution of the Security Council and thereby indirectly
                        mentioning India and Pakistan, you didn't mention India and Pakistan at all.
                        But there is no pressures about that. If you want to say that, we have no
                        strong views. You mentioned Korea, Japan and Vietnam, but what about South
                        Asia? You didn't mention the name of a country in South Asia. This makes it
                        seem that you have no interest in their status. But please don't attach too
                        much importance to our words; we never want to play any trick.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no, no, no. You
                        didn't make the point yesterday unfortunately.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: But you had no formulation
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know, it's our
                        formulation, but we are asking for your view. Do you think it would
                        straighten it if we said “withdrawal of all Indian and Pakistani military
                        forces"?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That is your decision. But
                        if you ask my views, I think it is better to mention them. Or you can
                        mention it this way, or that way, or not mention them at all.</p>
                    <p>BREAK—12:25 - 12:30 a.m.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: On India and Pakistan you
                        preliminarily said that would be the wording.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, you know our
                        policy anyway.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d104-15" facs="d104-15"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “The South Asian
                        subcontinent…” Maybe we should say “of a ceasefire between India and
                        Pakistan.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Once we have said
                        “between India and Pakistan” we can leave out “of all military forces,”
                        Don't you think?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Whatever you think. In
                        Chinese we favor more redundancy. If you decide it in this way it will
                        facilitate our work.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's decided.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: No reporting to our
                        superiors?</p>
                    <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's decided.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And then, what about our
                        points that neither will seek hegemony or neither should seek hegemony—there
                        is a question of mistaking interpretation ?</p>
                    <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, my only problem is
                        it just doesn't make any sense in English. It makes no difference because if
                        you are going to seek hegemony or we are going to seek hegemony, you won't
                        be able to wave a piece of paper and say we are doing something illegal.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: But here, frankly speaking
                        on this point, the policies of the two countries are different. Your view
                        toward your policy and our view toward your policy is different and
                        contrary-wise it might be said the same of our policy. Speaking most
                        frankly, certain policies which you had adopted in the past, you may not
                        have considered seeking hegemony, but we cannot guarantee it was not an
                        attempt to seek hegemony. Nor can we guarantee it in the future. But on the
                        other hand, that principle the United States could also apply to us. So what
                        is the impression we do not want to create. We do not want any person to
                        think we can guarantee on your behalf, or you can on ours in some sense,
                        that we did not exercise hegemony in the past and will not in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In English, let me just
                        say it means statement of intention by each side for itself that it will not
                        exercise hegemony.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: But as this is
                        something in common we think that whether it be in Chinese or in English,
                        the words “should” should be used.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d104-16" facs="d104-16"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> How about “intends.”
                        “Should” just doesn't make any sense in English. That's my problem with it.
                        It's almost meaningless that way.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: But of course this was
                        started out as a mistake in translation and if we had raised this point
                        early it might have been solved and you also expressed that you wouldn't
                        consider it a matter of great importance. So can we not compromise and use
                        the word “neither should?”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I am assuming in
                        the previous sentence my suggestion of yesterday has not been accepted to
                        strengthen the wording.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes, we made it very plain
                        we could not accept it. But even as it is in these sentences we did take in
                        some of your views. Now for instance in the fourth sentence we accept it
                        “with the other” in order to take into account the needs of the English
                        language. Actually, from our side our original thought was when you came
                        there was only one point of disagreement. That was our thought when you
                        first came.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When I first came
                        here?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: No, when the President first
                        came.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can't blame me for
                        having some difficulties with a proposition I have never heard.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I don't quite understand the
                        implication of what you said.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You said you thought we
                        only had differences about Taiwan when I came. I assume you mean when I came
                        with the President.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with you, but
                        this is not an issue we are raising.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: And I said I admit our
                        mistake.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know, but …</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: It was after another
                        re-checking with the Chinese that we discovered we made this mistake in
                        translation. Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                        himself told us “will” cannot be accepted; it should be “should” according
                        to the Chinese. Because we must treat each other on a basis of equality.
                        Chinese, too, should have a restraining effect, as should the English.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d104-17" facs="d104-17"/>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: The mistake was made in
                        the translation. We admit it. But it is not a change and our position is the
                        same. It is merely to change the interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This was originally our
                        sentence; we introduced this sentence.</p>
                    <p>VM Chaio: Our intention was “should” but I made the mistake in the
                        translation of the word “will.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The American illusion
                        is that disagreements arise because people don't understand each other. The
                        fact is disagreements arise because they understand each other very
                        well.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: That appears to be correct,
                        and also incorrect. I am a legalist. “Neither should seek hegemony in the
                        Asia-Pacific region, and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or
                        group of countries to establish hegemony.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You want to keep open
                        the option of accusing us of exercising hegemony.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: Exactly, and we give
                        you the same option on an equal basis. You cannot expect to say your way in
                        Indochina is anything against … . You cannot expect us to say nothing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, let's accept
                        this. All right. How should we proceed?</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: About the Taiwan
                        clause, then you withdraw these points? With regard to the clauses on Taiwan
                        and Japan—frankly speaking at the present moment we are not absolutely sure
                        of the precise implications. So we cannot say at the moment. So if this
                        wording is insisted on we cannot be sure what will be the result.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We each have our
                        difficulties. I don't see what purpose of yours is served by myself, who has
                        the major responsibility for this <pb n="18" xml:id="d104-18" facs="d104-18"/>being, being destroyed when I come back for statements that could be
                        modified. But in that case we will just have to wait till tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I think there is a
                        misunderstanding here. I just would like to say this: prior to the final
                        ratification by the leaders of our two countries, can it be that you and I
                        will both resolve with this reservation that it is not finalized until our
                        leaders do. So let us solve the remaining questions, just you and me. Then
                        after talking about the meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, we can say Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Foreign Minister Chi
                        Peng-fei also hld useful talks.</p>
                    <p>Then the question of the change of commitments, the wording will be as you
                        have handed over for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: And I, for the sake of
                        better understanding, would like to say, we understand your intention of not
                        saying “commitment.” The question is we are not certain about a point.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the other hand, it
                        does not refer to existing obligations.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “It will continue the
                        existing relationship.” Something in abstract terms instead of
                        relationship?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How about “foster?</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): “It will continue to foster the
                        existing close bonds.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: “Continue to maintain"?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I tell you why I like a
                        word other than “maintain.” We don't want this to be a synonym for treaty”
                        and don't want people to say “why did you say it here and not there?”
                        “Foster” is an active word; less than strengthen.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Something in general
                        terms.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “Foster” is not in
                        English a very strong word.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: ”… foster the Japanese
                        militarists.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “to promote"?</p>
                    <p>(VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName> suggested another word.)</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d104-19" facs="d104-19"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would prefer
                        “strengthen.” We have relations in the previous … .</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Your original word is
                        “honor.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but there we are
                        talking about a legal obligation—we are here not talking about a legal
                        obligation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: “Cherish"?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He's getting silly. “To
                        develop"?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: “To expand"?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: With better English I will
                        conquer you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have already
                        conquered me. I hope you are listening in on my telephones, because then you
                        will know what I am up against. I hope very much, not you personally, but …
                        .</p>
                    <p>“Will develop” is not a strong word. We have a great ability; no one who
                        hasn't sat through these meetings would believe what we can do with words.
                        You don't have to like this. This is our statement. There are a lot of
                        things in your statement we don't like.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Just telling you about our
                        feeling. How about “honor and obey.”</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: How about “reduce"?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: You must be kidding.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think you can explain
                        it on the grounds that we are using a slightly more active verb and a
                        slightly less active noun.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We will just tell you our
                        thinking and put that aside. Not to create new possible trouble, but still
                        to have to publish tomorrow. That's still our hope.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="d104-20" facs="d104-20"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So is it ours. So we
                        use “develop.”</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: We leave it for you to
                        … .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Take any one of
                        them?</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Except cherish?</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: Foster, develop … .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am slightly torn
                        because I think if we don't agree we can have another night session and
                        publish it the next morning. All right, lets leave it aside and let Mr.
                            <persName>Chang pick</persName> one of the three verbs. Shall we
                        continue while Mr. Chang reflects?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: At the beginning of that
                        paragraph, “the two sides agree that it is … .”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It just doesn't make
                        any sense otherwise—has no substantive meaning.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: At this stage, it is our
                        inclination if possible not to change it at all—keep it as is. A matter of
                        structure.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But every other
                        statement says . . It is now there without reference to anything. You said
                        you would consider it, and it doesn't make any …</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I am just thinking out loud
                        again on this matter. It is not very accurate, but we might consider putting
                        it at the end, after these four points. Then we might use wording like this
                        “both sides are of the view that it would be against the interests of the
                        peoples of the world, or for major countries to divide up spheres of
                        interest in the world.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that supposed to be
                        better English?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Just keep it as it is?</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: To divide up the world
                        into … .</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> He's terribly subtle;
                        you have a good point. That's a very good point. I know what he's trying to
                        say. ”… or for major countries to agree on spheres of interest among each
                        other.” He does have a good point. I would support you; you have a good
                        point.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): To carve out spheres of

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you say “carve out”
                        it becomes unilateral. His mind fascinates me. If he is willing to say “both
                        sides are of the view, “ I don't much care where it is placed. We can put it
                        at the end of the four points. It's more logical there. Logically, it just
                        doesn't fit here because we say with these principles in mind—what
                        principles?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Let us decide something
                        ourselves. It will be at the end of the four points. Do you think Mr.
                            <persName>Chang</persName> is being frivolous?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Before we get to
                        Taiwan. The trouble with him is he always knows what he's doing. He's not
                        frivolous; a nuisance, but he's never frivolous.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: How about “to divide up
                        areas of the world into spheres of influence,” We are not discussing a

                        world” doesn't help us much. We keep the original?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We keep the original
                        and we understand we are also opposed to dividing up areas. It's a very
                        subtle point and maybe something will occur to us by tomorrow morning. I
                        think we should get this typed up and run through it tomorrow morning just
                        to be absolutely sure.</p>

                        suggestion. At the end of page 7, every excluded field is going to scream it
                        is being left out so I suggest we say “they discussed exchanges in such
                        fields as …” so this is just demonstrative. We don't want this to be an

                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: At this end they discussed

                        change and that is literally the last one—where it says the leaders of China
                        … we want to say the Peoples Republic of China. In the rest of the document
                        we use China, but here… . Page one, “the leaders of the People's Republic of
                        China and the …” Leave out the middle names.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: All the middle names?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, mine too. If there
                        is a change I will check it tomorrow. One other slight suggestion … . Add to
                        “accompanied by” … “and other American officials.”</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, how should we
                        proceed, because I do want to discuss the press briefing with you before I
                        give it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We will do that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: When?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As soon as we get to
                        Shanghai?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: The most important things
                        will be finalized by the President and the Prime Minister. As to specific
                        wordings, we can see to it it is a very beautifully worded document.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, how shall we
                        do it?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Now this communique is fixed
                        between you and me, and now ve will hand it over to our President and our
                        Prime Minister and let us hop they can finalize it tomorrow morning. And for
                        the sake of an early completion of this work, if necessary may we meet once
                        again just for a shot time?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but it's going to
                        be an American press conference on Chinese soil. I want to be fair with you
                        and to make sure I don't say <pb n="23" xml:id="d104-23" facs="d104-23"/>anything that's embarrassing to you. And I want to tell you what I intend
                        to say in introducing it, what the certain questions will be and how I
                        intend to answer them.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Let us do two pieces of work
                        tomorrow morning. First to se if we can finalize this communique tomorrow
                        morning, and then when we have finalized it tomorrow morning the other work
                        will be much easier. And when it is finalized we will discuss how you tell
                        your press.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When is all this going
                        to happen? I don't feel that I must go to the industrial exhibition.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Surely we can delete
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will get this typed
                        tonight. You will be on the airplane?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Also then, or on the plane
                        tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. So they
                        can't do it on the plane. Must they do it?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, so we go straight
                        from the plane to a meeting place?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes, we can do it. It will
                        probably be very tight. Or early tomorrow morning to meet here.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your definition
                        of early? We will be in Shanghai, at 10:00. If we go immediately to whatever
                        meeting place you designate we can settle this in half an hour. I expect
                        that we will just read it through tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: You know our Chinese typing
                        is more difficult than yours. Of course what we want to be able to do is to
                        type out a complete copy in Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After we are finished,
                        you mean?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will agree, then get
                        a copy typed. While the copy is being typed, you and I discuss the press
                        conference.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="d104-24" facs="d104-24"/>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: See how much time we spend
                        on a single word like “foster” or “strengthen” or something like that. We
                        spent about an hour. Although I am a perfectionist I am quite against this
                        perfectionism. It is really not easy.</p>
                    <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you suggest?
                        What is the practical solution?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: As soon as we arrive in
                        Shanghai we will meet.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to meet to
                        discuss questions for the press conference in any event. We will have a text
                        and in our text we will put the American position first. And everything that
                        is published by the U.S. will have the American side first; everything that
                        is published by the Chinese will have the Chinese side first.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: About that, who is first,
                        only applies to these two paragraphs, nothing else.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh no, on Taiwan you go
                        first. It only applies to pages 2, 3, and 4.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Just these two
                        paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, it emphastically
                        does not include anything else. It begins from the top of our page 2 to the
                        top of page 5.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter (<persName>Chi</persName>): The Vice Minister emphasizes it has
                        to be agreed upon by our two leaders. Both sides consider this to be an
                        important document. And for our side, we are being very serious. What was
                        discussed and agreed upon by us yesterday was discussed and approved by our
                        leaders Of course, I am aware your system is different from ours, so please
                        don't think I had any other idea in mind when I expressed my views. Because
                        I really had that apprehension.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand this. At
                        the same time, if you can agree to this it will help so much in getting a
                        friend to put this to our people that having to spend another night is worth
                        it.</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: I agree to this working
                        method. Once we arrive in Shanghai we will meet.</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="d104-25" facs="d104-25"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Good, and you arrange
                        where we go and so forth.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: … . words, “cherish,”
                        “promote,”… .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's take one and get
                        it over with. “Develop.”</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang</persName>: Another word. How about
                        “preserve.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You prefer
                        “develop"?</p>
                    <p>VM <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: We prefer “develop.” You are
                        not agreeing to it … just …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Let us say “develop.” If
                        over the night you come up with something else we will still consider
                        it.</p>

                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> paid a call on the
                        Secretary just after he had arrived at the guest house, explaining upon
                        arrival that he wished to welcome the Secretary personally to Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>After discussing the merits of different types of tea, the Secretary told
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> that he hoped for the
                        opportunity to meet with the Foreign Minister in third countries. He
                        traveled often and would welcome a chance for contact whether it be at the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, in Canada, or any other mutually
                        convenient place. He also said that he would welcome an arrangement that
                        would enable him to get into direct telephone contact with the Foreign
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>The Premier asked the Foreign Minister whether he had made any progress on
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that he had not.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he marvelled at the Premier's grasp of detail.</p>
                    <p>The Premier replied that he also paid attention to broad issues as well.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that one could not be effective on broad issues
                        unless one had mastered the details. If you don't know the details you don't
                        know how things work.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked the Premier how he felt the trip had gone so far and
                        whether or not he had had a reaction from the people within the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> who had opposed it.</p>
                    <p>The Premier replied that he felt the trip had been beneficial. From his
                        channels he knew that there are still some that do not understand the
                        significance of the visit. He had made very careful efforts to explain the
                        significance of the trip before the President came and was continuing these
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Premier whether there had been wide TV and radio
                        coverage of the visit.</p>
                    <p>The Premier answered there had been news coverage all over the country. The
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> reads the world press very
                        carefully, the Premier continued. Two publications, a <pb n="3" xml:id="d105-03" facs="d105-03"/>restricted newspaper called Reference
                        News with a circulation of 5-6 million and a more tightly held daily
                        2-volume survey called Reference Materials carry daily excerpts from the
                        world press. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> is the most
                        careful reader of Reference Materials. It was he who spotted in Reference
                        Materials the 1967 Foreign Affairs article by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> which advocated closer ties with the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, and pointed out its significance to
                        us. Though he did not approve of all President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s policies, of course, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> voted for him in spirit in 1968.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that the President might need another such spiritual
                        vote in 1972.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to underscore the President's statement to
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> that controversy equals
                        news in the United States. There will be attacks on the visit and adverse
                        commentary, but these will neither reflect <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        policy nor affect it.</p>
                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said that he
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary told the Premier that Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName> will be visiting several
                        countries after the visit to explain American policy. The Secretary will be
                        briefing Ambassadors and appearing before Congress. It will be important to
                        tell America's allies and the elected representatives of the American people
                        that the United States stood up for its principles during its visit to
                        Peking.</p>
                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> commented that he had
                        heard that the Secretary had been very busy on the telephone the day after
                        the July 15 announcement. He said he understood that the Secretary would
                        have to discuss his policies with others. He reiterated that the PRO is
                        interested gradually in normalizing its relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Sunday, February 27, 1972—11:30 a.m. - 1:55 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: Guest House (Hotel), Shanghai</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Is there any new question your side would like to raise?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Just one really trivial
                        point which was suggested by one of my colleagues. Where you say, “the U.S.
                        stated that the peoples of Indochina …”, instead of “stated” say “stressed.”
                        That's all.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No more?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No more.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We too have a small change of wording, that is, concerning your
                        suggested wording for something about the talks between the Secretary of
                        State and the Foreign Minister. The word suggested by you yesterday was
                        “useful” talks.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao The word for useful in Chinese is yu li; that is the same as
                        “beneficial.” But in the immediately following paragraph we say the leaders
                        found it beneficial …”</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d106-02" facs="d106-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I see.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: So in order to avoid repetition, we would delete the word
                        “useful.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Could Mr.
                            <persName>Chang</persName> from his infinite vocabulary come up with a
                        word?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Another reason is that when we describe discussions between the
                        President and the Chairman we use “serious and frank” in describing the
                        attitude, and also in describing talks between the President and the Prime
                        Minister we use “extensive, earnest and frank.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. I am not
                        concerned. An adjective will do, but if we have it without an adjective it
                        just will sound critical in English. So I am not quarreling with you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, because to just follow “extensive, earnest and frank …”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In addition, we should
                        also say that Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William
                            Rogers</persName> and Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei held talks “in the
                        same spirit.” I have always wanted to put in a phrase, “although voices were
                        raised, it is not true that they came to blows.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: All right. No more.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I guess it's
                        rejected.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Now I will suggest that I would read out the Chinese, sentence by
                        sentence and …</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: The Vice Minister suggests this procedure. He reads out a
                        sentence of Chinese; I read it in English; and you check it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. The only
                        thing I request is a copy of it in Chinese—we have an interpreter
                        here—before we make it absolutely official.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch iao: Only when there is no question we will go on to the next
                        sentence.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d106-03" facs="d106-03"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What should we call it?
                        We have never said what we will call it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Do you have any suggestions?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Not an important matter. But I would think that it might be better
                        for you to give more thought to this because of your press.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We had tentatively
                        thought “Joint Communique”, but it doesn't make any difference.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We agree to “Joint Communique.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, and I will
                        check with our State Department experts whether there is some legal
                        significance to the word “communique” which I don't understand. And the date
                        is today?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Today.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Same date in Washington now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a slight
                        suggestion; could we drop the words “accompanying the President” because we
                        have already said “he visited.” It's obvious.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I accept that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a slight change
                        which is stylistic. After “the Chinese side stated”, could we add a colon to
                        make sure that the whole paragraph is what the Chinese side says?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, I agree. You have a comma after South Vietnam in your
                        paragraph on Vietnam. Can that be deleted?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I have one question. It was our impression that when the President
                        announced the proposals of January 25 he announced only on <pb n="4" xml:id="d106-04" facs="d106-04"/>behalf of the United States Government,
                        and the South Vietnamese Government expressed its support for that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, the formal proposal
                        was made at the plenary session, which was on the 27th, and the speech of
                        January 25 said it was done with the full concurrence and on behalf of the
                        South Vietnamese Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: But wasn't the original date of the proposal
                        then on January 27th?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will probably make
                        it the 27th. It's a good point. I think you are quite right—I think it was
                        formally submitted on the 27th. Let's say the 27th.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “to seek a relaxation of the tension.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we should drop
                        “the”—don't you think? (Ch'iao nods)</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: “The cease-fire line in Jammu and Kashmir"- we add to yours too.
                        And then also purely stylistic for our side—we add “to their own sides of
                        the cease-fire line.” How about having that in yours too?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “to their own
                        sides.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “And the withdrawal of all military forces to within their own
                        territories, and to their own sides of the cease-fire line in Jammu and
                        Kashmir.”</p>
                    <p>(There then followed a reading of the communique, including punctuation, to
                        confirm the final version.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now may I make a few
                        points, questions, first about the communique? This communique is going to
                        present us with major difficulties in the United States, which we will
                        attempt to meet with energy and in the spirit of our talks. You will have
                        formed your own judgments by now as to where the support for this present
                        China initiative comes from in the United States, and the problems that can
                        arise when it becomes a political issue. We have made this communique on the
                        basis that both sides should benefit and not that it was a victory for one,
                        and <pb n="5" xml:id="d106-05" facs="d106-05"/>the other was the loser. It
                        would make the realization of our common objective immeasurably more
                        difficult if Chinese domestic propaganda or Chinese foreign propaganda or
                        Chinese friends were to represent this as a major American defeat, or as any
                        American defeat.</p>
                    <p>(Ch'iao nods.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So I hope we will both
                        practice the spirit of equality in presenting this publicly.</p>
                    <p>(Ch'iao nods.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Secondly, it is
                        important for us that this communique in America not be presented entirely
                        as a Taiwan communique. And therefore, it is important that we do not
                        concern ourselves too much about press speculation in which every fine point
                        that Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> has so skillfully woven into this
                        communique may not be made.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: “It will be important that we …”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Not contradict every
                        speculation that the press may make. Let me give you an example. On the
                        issue of the renunciation of force, if I am asked or if we are asked, we
                        will say this communique speaks for itself. And we will not go into the
                        subtle elaborations of your colleague, Mr. Minister. It would help if you
                        did not explain all the sophisticated analyses in your propaganda. I am
                        giving this only as an example. Also, it would help if it could be avoided
                        that you give precisely the explanation of the meaning of “should” that you
                        gave yesterday. In other words, we are trying to set a direction with this
                        document. We are not going to be able to wave it at each other in the sense
                        of a binding obligation. And we should maintain the spirit that makes it
                        possible, especially over the next few months.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It is only a direction.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Because if we spend the
                        next few months arguing what it doesn't mean, then it will have defeated its
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: What we are doing is opening up a prospect.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d106-06" facs="d106-06"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can apply the same
                        principles to ourselves of course. We have an obligation not to embarrass
                        you just as we hope you will not embarrass us.</p>
                    <p>I want to give you our interpretation of our diplomatic contacts.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: There is no word “diplomatic.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> No, I mean the channels,
                        the means we will use to keep in contact; our understanding, no, our
                        interpretation. Our understanding is that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> will be the secret channel, and we
                        will pass to him or you to us all matters of substantive importance.
                        Secondly, you will notify us fairly soon of an open channel where the State
                        Department can pass messages back and forth about such issues as exchanges,
                        contacts and so forth. You can designate any capital you wish.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Last night I asked for instructions from Premier Chou En-lai on
                        this matter so we now agree to your first point, that is, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> as the secret channel.
                        As for the second point, which capital will serve as the open channel, we
                        will consider that further but hope you will too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Paris has the advantage
                        for us that the Ambassador who is there now and almost any successor will be
                        appointed by the White House, as opposed to coming from the bureaucracy, and
                        therefore will be controllable. So for us, Paris is very convenient.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Well, can we tentatively agree on Paris as an open channel, but
                        subject to further considerations?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And also the possibility of more capitals for such contacts?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: More than one would be
                        very confusing for us.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: All right, then, we will just keep Paris. Because, honestly
                        speaking, this word was put forward by you so we are not clear on what you
                        mean by various channels. But for one secret and one open, I suggest
                        Paris.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d106-07" facs="d106-07"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would suggest that
                        within the next two to three weeks you notify us through the secret channel,
                        and then we will make a very low-key announcement that we will be in touch
                        with each other through Paris. I am assuming the secret channel is open
                        now.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes. Actually, we have already used it, and so far as we are
                        concerned, we have been keeping it confidential very well.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we have also.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And will continue to keep it in strict confidence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One other matter. It is
                        conceivable that once the open channel is established, if something is put
                        into it that you consider substantive, just put it back into the secret
                        channel … give us the reply in the secret channel. My office has conducted
                        many secret negotiations and there has never been a leak.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I understand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. Now, for
                        your information, I have told you our position on Bangladesh, so there is no
                        sense repeating it. I think they will announce within the next days the
                        relief formula which I mentioned to you—33 and 1/3 percent. And again
                        nothing will be treated as official unless we tell you and we will tell you
                        first. The same about any specifics with respect to Soviet negotiations.</p>
                    <p>One other matter. As you know, I have been pressed by the Japanese to visit
                        Japan for many months. It may be unavoidable in the next six weeks to
                        two-months. If I go it will, however, not be an official visit, but I will
                        go there on the invitation of a private group. We simply wanted to let you
                        know. It is not fixed. If it should be fixed, I will let you know in time.
                        But I did not want to have been in Peking without letting you know the
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>Now, about the press conference this afternoon. First, let me make a general
                        point, though it will be a painful one, but we have to understand it. We
                        will, without any question, be asked whether our defense commitment to
                        Taiwan remains in force. And we will have to refer to the President's World
                        Report and say what is written there remains in force.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d106-08" facs="d106-08"/>
                    <p>Any attempt to avoid it would simply create an impossible situation, and the
                        Prime Minister, I believe, understands this. But I want you to know we will
                        do this in as low-key a way as we can. I am not asking you to approve it; I
                        am asking you to understand the necessity of it.</p>
                    <p>I want to review with you what I intend to do this afternoon. I will first
                        describe the process by which this communique was achieved. I will not bore
                        you with the details. The basic point that I will try to achieve with this
                        is to create a commitment by all the elements of our government to this
                        cOmmunique. And I will therefore claim a greater degree of participation for
                        the bureaucracy in the process than you may remember. The intention will be
                        good. Another purpose will be to move most of the discussions into this
                        period rather than to October, since we told everybody that my visit in
                        October was primarily technical.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, I will describe the substance of the communique, specifically, the
                        answer to the question of what does this communique mean. I will make two
                        points. One, that, of course, there is the text of the communique which
                        everybody can read, and secondly, there is the spirit of our discussions.
                        And that we are talking … that after this long interval it has been a very
                        delicate and difficult task for both of us, in which there are many
                        obstacles ahead and in which both sides have had to exercise great restraint
                        on many issues which are quite complex for them, but that it is in this
                        spirit that it should be considered, and not every single word in the
                        communique.</p>
                    <p>Now, I have had some questions written out of the kind that we expect to be
                        asked, and I want to tell you about them. For example, “were there any
                        secret deals?” “No.”</p>
                    <p>“Were there any topics discussed which are not mentioned in the communique?”
                        I will say “no.” I will say the discussions, of course, were somewhat more
                        detailed than in the communique. That will be all right, won't it?</p>
                    <p>(Ch'iao nods.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> 'What was I doing during
                        the sightseeing?” “I was working on the communique and other matters.”</p>
                    <p>“Did I ever meet the Prime Minister alone?” I will say: “Yes, briefly, to
                        arrange some technical matters.” Wherever possible I will try to tell the
                        truth. (laughter) Do you object?</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d106-09" facs="d106-09"/>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They will undoubtedly
                        ask did we mention the prisoners in North Vietnam? I will say “yes, it came
                        up in the general context of Vietnam. But the Chinese position has been
                        explained in the communique.”</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: How do you anticipate the correspondents will raise this
                        question:</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They will say 'Was it
                        mentioned?” They probably will also ask me about Downey. I will say we
                        recognize this is a matter of Chinese domestic jurisdiction, but we are of
                        course concerned about it. But it is not an international matter as
                        such.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, and I would hope that when you reply to that question you
                        will reply just in the way you put it now because that will facilitate how
                        we deal with this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can be sure.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We don't want to complicate this matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but I wanted to be
                        sure. It's an unusual thing to have an American press conference on Chinese
                        soil.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And the fact an American President has flown on a Chinese plane is
                        also unprecedented.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I similarly will not
                        give details. But if they bring up Andre Malraux's mention of economic aid I
                        think in fairness to you I should say no, you never brought it up or asked
                        for it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That's a fact.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a fact. I just
                        don't want to breach the confidence of the discussions without mentioning
                        it. If I am asked about anything concerning Chairman Mao, such as his
                        health, I will make no comment. Or you tell me what I should say.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: You can say you have all seen the television of that interview,
                        and he is in fine health.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d106-10" facs="d106-10"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He certainly was
                        vigorous. Can I say this?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: He was vigorous.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not saying it
                        isn't true, I am saying whether it is proper for me to comment on him at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes, you can say that. Proceeding from the facts you can say you
                        all saw him on the television and saw he is vigorous.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am delighted. It's no
                        problem at all. I just want to be correct. When I am asked, 'What do we mean
                        by normalization of relations?”, what do you think we mean?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We mean by “normalization,” the establishment of normal diplomatic
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and a gradual
                        movement in that direction.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: “Normalization” is aimed at the establishing of normal state
                        relations, and what we are suggesting now is a process toward that goal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: As its object.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: In our communique establishing diplomatic relations with Mexico
                        and Argentina we didn't use this, the word “establishment of diplomatic
                        relations”, but used the words “establishment of normal relations.”
                        Establishment of normal relations means establishment of diplomatic
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You don't use words
                        idly. I think I can handle the rest of this. Have you any questions?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: From my repeated many contacts with you it is my view that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has been very prudent
                        in dealing with these matters.</p>
                    <p>First of all, I would like to express my deep appreciation for your letting
                        us know about this in advance. The only question here is the question of the
                        so-called “Defense Treaty.” Of course, I cannot know exactly how you will
                        raise this question and how you will make your low-key reply in concrete
                        terms.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d106-11" facs="d106-11"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will answer it once.
                        I will say, “Gentlemen, we are here on the soil of a country with which we
                        have no diplomatic relations and for which this is the most sensitive issue.
                        Therefore do not keep asking this question. I will answer it once. We stated
                        in the World Report our position on this, and the statement in the World
                        Report remains intact. Then when the President goes back to Congress he will
                        have to answer it again.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Are you certain that this is what will happen?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is certain to
                        happen.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: And also a fact you describe. It is a fact in existence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I will not mention
                        that. I only mentioned this to you so I will not claim any discussion
                        between us on the subject. All this discussion about the press is between
                        us.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: We appreciate very much what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has said in telling this to us. We hold this in
                        the spirit of our discussions. Of course, you have a lot of difficulties.
                        You cannot stop the press from raising these questions. We can only express
                        the hope that you will be as prudent as possible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Better that the
                        question is asked and answered today. Because the longer it is not answered,
                        the more extreme the answer will have to be when it is raised. But it will
                        certainly be raised, so we will not get into that difficulty. But I will
                        answer it only once.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I only like to state that, first of all, we thank Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> very much for telling us about
                        this. I also would like to say we do believe you will be able to handle this
                        properly. We only hope you will avoid a situation where we would be forced
                        to make a reaction.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What would be such a
                        situation?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I cannot anticipate all the things which might happen, but from
                        what you have told us so far and if you proceed as you have said, we will
                        need no response.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d106-12" facs="d106-12"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is highly improbable
                        that I will go beyond this. In fact, I would say that flatly now if it were
                        not for various uncertainties and the fact I have had only three hours
                        sleep. But we both have interest to avoid a controversy, and I will go to
                        great lengths to avoid your difficulty. One way I could handle it, for
                        example, is not to wait for a question but just to state it and say I know
                        you are going to ask me this and rather than wait for your question … but
                        that may be a little too provocative.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Keep it flexible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's certain to
                        come.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: It might not be so good.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Sometimes you want to …</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I don't have to
                        answer the question they give me anyway. Whatever the question is I will
                        move it in the direction I gave you. All right, so we are finished. Now what
                        happens next?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Your date (for the communique) is the 27th,
                        but you say “visited until the 28th.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's date it the 28th.
                        Or we could say “visited the 21st to the 27th and plans to stay another
                        day.” Now I have one other point which is a question of indifference to me.
                        I promised Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName> some
                        information which would take about 15 minutes. When should we do it? It's up
                        to you.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: When do you plan your press conference?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would think,
                        5:00.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: That's too early, 5:00, because we still have the text in Chinese
                        to give to you.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d106-13" facs="d106-13"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem is they
                        have to go to your banquet, don't they? And they have to file their story.
                        So 5:00 is probably the latest they can do it.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: What we are concerned about is to be able to give him the Chinese
                        before. But we can go ahead, since we agreed on the English text even if you
                        check on the Chinese text. You won't release it right away, will you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, and then when both
                        our sides retype this communique we should like to recheck it, but that can
                        be done by the staff.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: You hand yours to us, and we hand ours to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do we know how to find
                        you?</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Oh, yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Just make sure we know
                        how to find you. I will have this typed. The question is, when can they
                        release it? I am assuming right after we are finished with the press
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: No problem with us. I believe there will be no question left, but
                        in the spirit of honesty I will get in touch with the Prime Minister as soon
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I with the
                        President. I will have <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName>
                        with me at the press conference for reasons which are obvious. I will do
                        most of the talking.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: Some of our correspondents will also attend.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly.</p>
                    <p>VM Ch'iao: I will not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You should.</p>

                    <p>A Gradual Approach</p>
                    <p>After pleasantries, the Foreign Minister opened by saying the President's
                        visit had been a good beginning for a gradual development of relationships
                        between the two governments. Now that the communique has been published,
                        more contacts will follow. Differences will continue, but we should exchange
                        views in an effort to find areas of agreement. We shall agree on those
                        things that are possible and leave to later the items on which we cannot
                        agree. Although we have agreed views as set forth in the communique,
                        implementation will be gradual. We will tackle it slowly. As far as
                        exchanges in people and materials on culture, sports, medicine and science
                        are concerned, we must go through certain formalities. The exchanges must be
                        carried out gradually. The same is true of trade.</p>
                    <p>Channels of Communication</p>
                    <p>We want to consider channels of communications further, the Foreign Minister
                        continued, and will let the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side know.
                        Though the communique mentions that we will stay in touch through different
                        channels, we still wish to study how and where implementation is to take
                        place.</p>
                    <p>At the moment it is difficult for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to
                        establish any permanent non-governmental institution in Peking. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> prefers to deal through a third country,
                        although we would like to consider further which one to use. As you know,
                        the Foreign Minister continued, the Prime Minister criticized me yesterday
                        for not having looked into the question of direct telephone communication
                        with you. I will look into it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister whether he had communication with
                        his Ambassador in New York.</p>
                    <p>Not around the clock, the Foreign Minister replied, only during certain times
                        of the day.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that although the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        could not be used as a permanent vehicle of contact without arousing
                        resentment, it might be useful under special circumstances. If the need

                        with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that he preferred to study this question. The PRO
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission is new and not very effective
                        yet.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the Foreign Minister had given thought to the
                        establishment of a non-governmental trade office such as those which had
                        been established with the Japanese. Two could perhaps be set up, one in New
                        York and one in Peking.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d107-03" facs="d107-03"/>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that the PRO had considered it, but does not think
                        the conditions are right. The question can be considered later.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that as trade develops, the question can be reviewed.</p>
                    <p>As contacts develop, we shall see, was the Foreign Minister's rejoinder.</p>
                    <p>Canton Fair</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister whether the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could publicize the fact that the PRO would invite several
                        American businessmen to the Canton Fair.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName> noted that
                        Seymour Topping had raised this point during his interview with Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>. The Premier said that we
                        would consider the application of several businessmen. The PRO is ready to
                        accept some applications, but the number is not great.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether a statement to that effect could be made when we
                        return to the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that some applications would be selectively
                        endorsed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that this would be most helpful.</p>
                    <p>Language Exchange</p>
                    <p>Director Chang said that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was
                        considering an exchange of interpreting and language teaching materials.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d107-04" facs="d107-04"/>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that he gathered the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        side felt that our interpreter had done a capable job, but that
                        linguistically at least he had not yet been “liberated.” Of course the
                        English language used in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had changed
                        too.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister confirmed that the Chinese side felt that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interpreting had been very competent but
                        agreed that language usage had changed. Time magazine, for instance, had
                        been very easy to follow twenty years ago but now it was very difficult.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was not sure that he could be of very much help
                        there.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side
                        had some materials ready they could be exchanged now, but the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> materials were not yet prepared. <persName corresp="#p_FCWJ1">Charles Freeman</persName>, the American interpreter,
                        noted that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> materials were not ready
                        either.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned that the State Department would probably expand its
                        course in Chinese at the Foreign Service Institute. Also, Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> added, the President's
                        trip would be an encouragement to our younger officers to study Chinese. The
                        Secretary suggested further that Chinese interest in English would probably
                        expand as a result. Language studies which are basic to international
                        communication represent a profitable field of cooperation which is to the
                        mutual advantage of both nations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Follow Up</p>
                    <p>The Secretary made it clear that <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall
                            Green</persName>, with the help of Alfred Jenkins, would be in charge of
                        planning and supervising the follow-up for the visit. They would work with
                        the White House staff, but now that the communique had been agreed upon, the
                        Secretary wanted to develop contacts in a normal way. He hoped that
                        Assistant Secretary Green would have the opportunity to get to know the
                        Chinese side well.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d107-05" facs="d107-05"/>
                    <p>The Secretary thanked the Chinese side deeply for their gracious hospitality.
                        The entire visit had been planned and carried out to perfection. The
                        treatment we had received at the banquet table and at every meal, the
                        Secretary continued, would be a challenge to our wives when we returned to
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Both sides have to recognize, he continued, that once we are 12,000 miles
                        apart again it will be difficult for misunderstandings not to arise. The
                        United States has misunderstandings with other nations with whom we have
                        instant communications and full diplomatic staffs. The Secretary pledged to
                        do all he could to avoid misunderstandings. Although both sides must move
                        slowly, it was very important to keep the momentum of the relationship
                        going. In view of all the publicity given the trip, it would be
                        disappointing if nothing concrete developed. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would do its part to move gradually. Nevertheless, it was
                        important that there be sufficient activity to provide evidence that the
                        relationship was moving forward. In this connection, the results of the
                        discussion just concluded on exchange of language materials will be welcomed
                        even though it has little political significance in itself.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">National Committee for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-China Relations</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reminded the
                        Foreign Minister that he had asked for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        recommendations on what private group might coordinate exchanges in sports,
                        medicine, science and culture. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        suggests merely as one possibility the National Committee for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-China Relations as an entirely private and
                        effective organization which is representative of a broad range of opinion
                        in the United States. The Committee has been involved in preparing for the
                        visit of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Table Tennis team. The
                        Secretary added that this was simply a suggestion. The government has not
                        mentioned the matter to the National Committee. If the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> preferred another group, that would be
                        fine.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d107-06" facs="d107-06"/>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName> pointed out
                        that when the Chinese Table Tennis team invited the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> team to China last year, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Table Tennis Association returned the invitation. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> team accepted, and this was the
                        understanding between the two organizations. Later, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Table Tennis Association told the Chinese
                        Table Tennis team that the National Committee would like to join in the
                        arrangements for the visit. But the Chinese team has not given an
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese team, Director Chang continued, believes it better for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Table Tennis team alone to present the
                        invitation. If others are involved in the invitation, other friendly
                        organizations will be unhappy. We have no objection, however, if the
                        American Table Tennis team asks other organizations to help them make
                        preparations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out to the Chinese side that we were talking about two
                        different things. We were not concerned about the table tennis visit in
                        particular. What we were interested in was finding a coordinating body in
                        which we both have confidence. Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> added that
                        individual organizations will, in some instances, at least, need a central
                        organization to help on the mechanics of visits: reception, hospitality,
                        funding, etc. Otherwise, the only recourse would be some kind of government
                        body. The Secretary added that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is
                        looking for a liaison group for people-to-people contact to whom other
                        groups in the United States can come for help. The Secretary concluded with
                        the hope that the Chinese would consider the National Committee and advise
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of the suitability of that
                        organization or any alternative for this purpose.</p>

                    <p>Delivered by <persName corresp="#p_RPW1">Peter Rodman</persName> to Miss
                        Shih, 3 March 1972</p>
                    <p>March 3, 1972</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. Government proposes to disclose on March 10 the location of the
                        public contact point with the People's Republic of China as agreed upon
                        during the President's visit. Without making a formal announcement the U.S.
                        side would talk along the following lines: The U.S. Government and the
                        government of the People's Republic of China have agreed that the contacts
                        mentioned in their February 28, 1972, Joint Communique will be maintained by
                        their Ambassadors in Paris, France.</p>
                    <p>2. The U.S. side believes it would be beneficial if the actual contacts could
                        begin soon in order to show some concrete results to the American
                        public.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviet Ambassador called on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on March 1, 1972, to obtain an account of the
                        President's trip to the People's Republic of China. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> talked in a most general way,
                        repeating what he said in his press conference in Shanghai about the
                        discussions on world affairs. In reply to a question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the People's Republic
                        of China expressed no objection to the relaxation of tensions between the
                        Soviet Union and the United States. When asked whether the People's Republic
                        of China felt threatened by the Soviet Union, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the matter did not
                        arise. The Soviet Ambassador inquired whether the U.S. was prepared to make
                        a joint appeal to the People's Republic to participate in talks on nuclear
                        disarmament. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied in
                        the negative.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d108-02" facs="d108-02"/>
                    <p>4. The President appreciates the invitation extended to Senators <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> to visit the People's Republic of China. At the same
                        time he has found an equally intense interest on the part of the leaders of
                        the House of Representatives—a co-equal branch of the Legislature. The
                        President would therefore be extremely grateful if the Prime Minister would
                        also entertain a request for Congressmen Hale Boggs, Majority Leader of the
                        House of Representatives, and Gerald Ford, Minority Leader, to visit the
                        People's Republic of China in the near future but subsequent to the visit of
                        Senators <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION</p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: Meeting Between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                            Hua</persName> and Cdr. <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">JONATHAN T.
                            HOWE</persName> in New York City, March 6, 1972 - 7:15-8:20 p.m.</p>
                    <p>During the meeting, which was conducted in a most cordial atmosphere, the
                        Chinese <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Ambassador raised four
                        subjects:</p>
                    <p>— The first concerned Chinese agreement to disclosure of the Paris channel on
                        March 10.</p>
                    <p>— The second concerned Chinese agreement to invite Congressmen Hale Boggs and
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald Ford</persName> to visit China. Their
                        visit would occur after that of Senators <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>
                        and invitations would be transmitted through the new Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>— The third concerned security of the Chinese <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission following the death of a member of their delegation
                        whom they believe was poisoned. They expressed the hope that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would ask the New York Police
                        Department to strengthen security measures for the Chinese Mission. This is
                        not so much in terms of numbers but in the type of security measures
                        provided in light of the poisoning incident. They also indicated that when a
                        written report from the medical examiner is received, they will ask the
                        police department to formally investigate the death. They expressed the hope
                        that the police department would do its utmost in the investigation to
                        determine the cause.</p>
                    <p>— The fourth matter concerned a problem associated with the purchase of a
                        house for their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission. They have found a
                        place, a Motor Inn near Lincoln Square on West 66th Street, and are close to
                        an agreement with the present owners on price. <pb n="2" xml:id="d110-02" facs="d110-02"/>They have been told it would take about two months
                        before they can move in after terms of purchase have been agreed upon. Their
                        lawyer has told them that this period could be shortened and as they are
                        most anxious to move as soon as possible, they wondered whether Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> could render
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>The following is a more detailed report on the meeting and these four
                        topics:</p>
                    <p>At about 4:00 p. m. the Chinese had called to request a meeting. At 7:15 p.m.
                        the Ambassador, accompanied by his interpreter Miss Shih, entered our
                        special meeting place in New York City. After social amenities and small
                        talk, the Ambassador indicated that our message of March 3 had been
                        transmitted to their government and they had received a reply. The
                        Ambassador indicated that he would leave a copy of the message from his
                        government, and then slowly read the note at Tab A concerning disclosure of
                        the Paris channel on March 10 and Chinese agreement to invite Congressmen
                        Boggs and Ford to visit the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. In answer
                        to a question concerning announcement of the invitation to the two
                        Congressmen, the Ambassador indicated that it was his assumption that there
                        would be no announcement of the invitations until they had been received in
                        the Paris channel. He referred to the fact that the visit of the two Senate
                        leaders had already been announced.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then raised two other concerns:</p>
                    <p>Security of Chinese Mission. In presenting his concerns about security, the
                        Ambassador referred to a prepared text. He began by stating that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on a number of
                        occasions had expressed concern about the security of the Chinese Mission in
                        New York. The Chinese appreciated this very much. There had been one
                        unfortunate incident which the Ambassador would like to mention. On the
                        night of February 6-7 a staff member, Wang Hsi Tsanh, died in his room on
                        the 14th floor of the Roosevelt Hotel. He was a young man, being only 26
                        years old.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then gave the following details concerning the death. On the
                        night of February 6 at 11:30 p.m. Mr. Wang went to his room which he lived
                        in by himself. At 9:00 a.m. on February 7 some of the Chinese personnel
                        knocked on his door. When there was no reply, they entered his room and
                        found him dead in his bed. They also found the blanket on the body and
                        everything else in the room in order.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d110-03" facs="d110-03"/>
                    <p>They immediately informed the New York Police Department as well as Mrs.
                        Loeb's Commission (apparently a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or N.Y.
                        group that helps take care of the missions). They also informed the lawyer
                        and doctors of the Mission. The police called an ambulance and the doctors
                        and lawyer soon arrived. After the examination by a doctor they ascertained
                        that Mr. Wang was dead. The Chinese then sent the body to the New York Chief
                        Medical Examiner for autopsy to determine the cause of the death.</p>
                    <p>Between 6:00 and 8:00 in the evening of February 7 the police sent people to
                        the Roosevelt Hotel to inspect the surroundings. After their inspection the
                        police expressed the opinion that it was not possible that the death was
                        caused by outside causes because they hadn't found any sign of “outsiders.”
                        The police took away what was left in a tea cup and also the pillow case
                        because it contained some blood spots and saliva.</p>
                    <p>On February 12 members of the Mission met Dr. Helpern and associates of the
                        Chief Medical Examiner's Office. According to Dr. Helpern, the autopsy did
                        not find any cause of death. The Chinese were informed that a toxicological
                        examination was being carried out.</p>
                    <p>On February 18 some members of the Chinese Mission also met Dr. Helpern
                        again. This time, according to chemical reports and toxicologic analysis,
                        they reported finding in the blood, liver, and in the tea a large amount of
                        nicotine, an amount large enough to cause death. The Chinese were told that
                        additional examinations would be needed of Mr. Wang's brain, stomach, and
                        urinary system. Dr. Helpern also told them that the tissues of the dead body
                        indicated no abnormal phenomenon and that Mr. Wang had not died of natural
                        diseases or physical causes but rather from chemicals, i.e. toxicosis.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that with regard to toxicosis, the medical examiners
                        estimated there were two possible causes:</p>
                    <p>— The deceased could have injected himself, but they had found no holes in
                        his body indicating injection.</p>
                    <p>— Another cause might be that it was done by “outsiders.”</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the Chinese had studied and analyzed the case and
                        ruled out the possibility of self-injection of nicotine or the possibility
                        of <pb n="4" xml:id="d110-04" facs="d110-04"/>Mr. Wang himself taking the
                        nicotine. He indicated that this was not possible because Mr. Wang seemed
                        very lively and happy. He was not gloomy, upset or depressed. In addition,
                        Mr. Wang seldom went out to shops or drugstores to buy things. He couldn't
                        speak English and therefore always went out with his friends. The
                        Ambassador, stated, “We think he might not know such a thing as nicotine.”
                        For this reason they had ruled out the possibility of suicide.</p>
                    <p>The other possibility left, the Ambassador continued, was that someone had
                        entered the room and put nicotine in the teacup and water Mr. Wang drank. He
                        stated that they had asked Dr. Helpern to give them a written report of the
                        chemical analysis so that they could inform the New York Police Department
                        of the investigation and find out the reason. They wanted to find out what
                        was behind all this and find out who was the murderer.</p>
                    <p>On February 25 some members of the Mission again contacted the Chief Medical
                        Examiner's Office and Dr. Helpern told them they had found nicotine in the
                        water of the thermos bottle that Mr. Wang had used but the nicotine in the
                        thermos was not as “obvious” (clarified as not as concentrated) as was the
                        nicotine in the tea cup. The medical examiners had also analyzed the stomach
                        of the deceased but had found no nicotine. It was explained that any
                        nicotine in the stomach had probably been rapidly absorbed. This, according
                        to the Ambassador, was the result of the investigation up to February
                        25.</p>
                    <p>For the present he stated we are still waiting for the report of the Chief
                        Medical Examiner's Office. When they have a written report, the Chinese will
                        formally ask the New York Police Department to carry out an investigation
                        and find out the cause. Since Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had on many occasions asked about the safety of
                        the Mission, they hoped that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would ask the New York Police Department to
                        strengthen security measures for the Chinese Mission. The Ambassador added
                        that when they have the written report, they will ask for an investigation.
                        They hope that the police department will do its best to investigate and
                        find the cause of the death. The Ambassador asked Commander Howe to convey
                        this to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>After expressing sympathy and indicating that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would do all that he could, Commander Howe asked
                        if they were also concerned about the delay in receiving the written report
                        of the Chief Medical <pb n="5" xml:id="d110-05" facs="d110-05"/>Examiner. In
                        reply the Ambassador stated that on February 25 Dr. Helpern had indicated
                        that the report would be ready within two weeks. He said the Chinese would
                        get in contact with Dr. Helpern at that time. He also remarked that
                        Ambassador Phillips and Mrs. Loeb had expressed sympathy after the incident
                        and that it had been greatly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>Location for Mission The Ambassador then, speaking without notes, indicated
                        that the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        had expressed an interest in China in rendering assistance in helping the
                        Chinese find a house. He stated that they had found a Motor Inn near Lincoln
                        Square on West 66th Street. During the negotiations thus far they had come
                        quite near in price but had not yet come to an agreement. They had entrusted
                        their lawyer, Mr. Popper (this is phonetically correct, the Chinese were not
                        certain of the exact spelling), to conduct the negotiations. They had also
                        received active assistance from Mrs. Loeb's office. She had become involved
                        because the Motor Inn has a mortgage for a long period—over a decade. After
                        talking to Mrs. Loeb and the Board of the insurance company, it was agreed
                        to receive payment now with $106,000 interest paid by the Chinese side. The
                        Chinese had agreed to this condition. At the present time the two sides are
                        negotiating on price and the lawyer representing the Chinese is negotiating
                        with the broker of the owners of the Inn. The Ambassador expressed the hope
                        that they would soon come to an agreement.</p>
                    <p>He then reiterated that when in China, both the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had expressed a desire to render
                        assistance and this was greatly appreciated. The main concern now, he
                        stated, was that after agreement was reached on price, it would take a long
                        time to move in. They had been told it would take about two months. Mr.
                        Popper had told the Chinese that the time period could be shortened and the
                        Chinese hoped this was so. Their hope is that as soon as possible after
                        agreement is reached they would be able to move in. The Ambassador then
                        said, “We wonder whether Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> can render assistance in connection with this?” He
                        added that because the Roosevelt Hotel is in one of the busiest areas of the
                        city, it was difficult for them to concentrate on their work. Commander Howe
                        replied that he would convey the message to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and he was sure that we would look into possible
                        ways to facilitate more rapid Chinese possession.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that this was all he had to convey but that he did wish
                        to send his warm greetings to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. Commander Howe reciprocated.</p>

                    <p>While eating a light snack, the Ambassador commented that the communique had
                        received extensive attention by the American people and by people
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>He noted in answer to a question that he didn't feel that more numbers of
                        police were needed or superficial protection but that measures should be
                        taken in other protective areas. He also commented that when they asked the
                        New York Police Department to conduct an investigation, we should all be
                        aware that it will probably cause an “uproar” in the press.</p>

                    <p>1. The Chinese side has no objection to the U.S. side disclosing the Paris
                        channel on March 10 along the lines envisaged by the U.S. side. The Chinese
                        Government will not make an announcement on this matter, but when asked, it
                        will reply in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chinese side agrees to invite Mr. Hale Boggs, majority leader of the
                        U.S. House of Representatives, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald
                            Ford</persName>, minority leader, to visit China. Their visit will be
                        arranged to take place after the visit of Mr. Michael Mansfield and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Hugh Scott</persName>. All the
                        abovementioned leaders of the Senate and the House will be received as
                        guests of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The letters of
                        invitation will be transmitted later through the Paris channel as one of the
                        earliest results of the functioning of that channel.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman,</p>
                    <p>Please accept my warm thanks, as well as those of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and all of the Americans who
                        accompanied us, for the gracious consideration with which we were received
                        in the People's Republic of China. We have come away from your country with
                        a far deeper appreciation of the beauties of its land, the qualities of its
                        people, and the views of its government.</p>
                    <p>I especially benefitted from, and I will always remember, our conversation on
                        the afternoon of my arrival in Peking. Your frank and wise observations, as
                        well as your warm welcome, set the framework for the entire week which did
                        so much to further the interests of our two great peoples. My conversations
                        with Premier Chou En-lai were marked by the same tone of candor; they
                        enabled both sides to clarify their views, articulate our differences; and
                        explore common ground.</p>
                    <p>World realities brought us together after a long separation. I believe these
                        realities will continue to shape our future. If, together, we maintain the
                        mutual candor and comprehension that marked our discussions during my visit,
                        we can move further down the road on which we have now embarked. There is no
                        more important goal for our two nations and for our two peoples.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Premier,</p>
                    <p>On behalf of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, the official
                        party, and all the other Americans who accompanied me on my visit to the
                        People's Republic of China, I would like to express my deep appreciation for
                        the generous courtesy and thoughtfulness of your government, your people,
                        and you personally. For all of us, the week in Peking, Hangchow and Shanghai
                        was a truly memorable and historic occasion. Please extend our gratitude and
                        thanks to the many Chinese officials who treated us with such efficiency and
                        hospitality.</p>
                    <p>The most significant and rewarding aspect of my visit was, of course, my
                        meetings with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and
                        yourself. I believe our discussions, and the joint communique which reflects
                        them, served as a model of candor and comprehensiveness for leaders of
                        nations who seek to bridge a wide gulf of isolation and differences. My
                        understanding of your country's views was greatly enriched, and I found our
                        discussions of the broader aspects of international affairs most rewarding.
                        I hope that our talks also served to define the purposes and direction of
                        American policy.</p>
                    <p>In your toast at the opening banquet you expressed the “hope that, through a
                        frank exchange of views between our two sides to gain a clearer notion of
                        our differences and make efforts to find common ground, a new start can be
                        made in the relations between our two countries.” This was my purpose in
                        travelling to your country. Together, I believe we have served that goal
                        and, in so doing, have advanced the interests not only of our two great
                        peoples but of all the peoples of the world.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d111-04" facs="d111-04"/>
                    <p>We both recognize that we have only marked a beginning. Before us lies the
                        challenge of developing what we have started. This process will require
                        mutual understanding and restraint as well as continuing candor. The United
                        States will approach this important task in that spirit.</p>

                    <p>In the fortnight since the conclusion of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit, the United States has
                        carried out incessant, large-scale bombings against the Democratic Republic
                        of Viet Nasa. On March 10, the U.S. Government further proclaimed the week
                        from March 26 to April 1 a so-called “national week of concern for prisoners
                        of war.” The Chinese Government cannot but express grave concern over all
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government would like to state frankly that the United States
                        will not be able to attain its goal by this line of action. If the U.S.
                        Government truly wants to bring about an early release of its prisoners of
                        war, it should accept the seven-point proposal and the two points of
                        elaboration put forward by Viet Nam and enter into earnest negotiations with
                        the Vietnamese side. Any attempt to exert pressure by war threats can only
                        arouse the people of the three countries of Indochina to even stronger
                        resistance. With the war continuing and the casualties of the three
                        Indochinese peoples increasing, how are the prisoners of war to be released?
                        The Chinese people, who share weal and woe with the people of the three
                        countries of Indochina, can only express their indignation and support the
                        three Indochinese peoples in their war of resistance through to the end.</p>
                    <p>We hope that the U.S. Government will give serious consideration to this
                        view.</p>

                    <p>Summary</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> called on Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> June 7 to report on the
                        status of the Wang case. In a meeting that lasted for more than an hour,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> covered all aspects
                        of the case, reporting that the investigation is at a standstill but that
                        the case is still open. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> emphasized the sincerity of the United States' concern
                        over the death of Mr. Wang and the thoroughness of our effort to resolve the
                        case. His presentation also reflected the investigators' disappointment over
                        the Chinese Mission's denial of access to, and fingerprinting of, individual
                        Chinese staffers. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>'s low-key response
                        stressed continuing Chinese concern that such an episode occurred so soon
                        after the Chinese delegation's arrival in New York. He noted that the
                        Chinese Mission had already explained their negative position on access to
                        the Mission's staff and asserted once more that the cause of the “murder”
                        lies outside of the Mission. <persName>Huang</persName> seemed to accept
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s report reflected the
                        good faith of the United States Government's effort but maintained a posture
                        that effectively leaves the burden completely on the United States to come
                        up with a solution.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d113-02" facs="d113-02"/>
                    <p>It appears that we have successfully passed through this stage of the case.
                        Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>'s reaction to the report, although
                        firm, was not contentious and did not imply any Chinese plans that would
                        exacerbate the situation. Before we can rule out further troublesome Chinese
                        action, we will have to see what further instructions Peking, following
                        receipt of Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>'s report, gives the Chinese
                        Mission here.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Report on Case</p>
                    <p>As anticipated reftel, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> called on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang
                            Hua</persName> on June 7th to discuss the Wang case. Counselor Hsing and
                        Mrs. Shih Yen-hua were present, as were <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> Advisers Joseph Glennon and <persName corresp="#p_THET1">Harry Thayer</persName>. The meeting lasted about one and one-quarter
                        hours.</p>
                    <p>After a brief exchange regarding the Ambassadors' plans to take leave this
                        summer (with Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> saying that he is “still
                        waiting to hear” about his own plans), Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> turned to the subject of the Wang
                        case. He said that he wanted to bring Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        up to date on a matter that has troubled the United States side, as it has
                        troubled the Chinese. He said that to insure clarity he would read from a
                        paper prepared in the United States Mission. He said he would be glad to
                        have Mrs. Shih (notetaker and interpreter) interrupt at any point to clarify
                        her notes.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>, reading from the
                        prepared notes, said that he very much regretted the death of Mr. Wang. This
                        has been a sad episode in what we hope has otherwise been a relatively
                        smooth move to New York. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said he appreciated Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName>'s courtesy in having his staff inform us of
                        the cremation of Mr. Wang's body last Friday and of the fact that the ashes
                        are being returned to Peking. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said he understood from Dr. Helpern that Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> was able to utilize the Medical Examiner's
                        assistance in the cremation and we are glad that the City Government was
                        able to be helpful,</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that he
                        personally has been kept fully informed regarding all developments in the
                        case of Mr. Wang and that the White House, as well as the State Department,
                        has also been kept abreast of all developments. <pb n="3" xml:id="d113-03" facs="d113-03"/>The United States Government has been extremely
                        concerned about Mr. Wang's death and, therefore, we have made every possible
                        effort to resolve the mystery. So far, however, we have been
                        unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that on Monday
                        (June 5th) he had a final meeting with the head of the New York City Police
                        investigation and his principal assistant, and with Dr. Halpern. Our
                        Government has also called in other agencies to assist in the investigation,
                        as Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> is aware, and they have cooperated
                        with the New York City Police, which has been the focal point for the
                        investigation. The investigation is continuing and the case will remain open
                        until it is solved.</p>
                    <p>At the Monday meeting, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said, he had gone over all aspects of the case once
                        again to satisfy himself personally that all available avenues of
                        investigation were being explored. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that he is satisfied that all avenues have been
                        explored and will continue to be explored: The police and other agencies
                        have exhaustively sought to find a likely source of nicotine, have
                        thoroughly investigated all hotel employees, have questioned persons in the
                        hotel area, checking all sources of information or leads as to how the
                        nicotine got to Mr. Wang's room. Other agencies have made investigations
                        elsewhere in the United States, as well as abroad.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that when there
                        had seemed to be a dead end to the investigation, Mr. Glennon had personally
                        encouraged the police to explore other possibilities—such as various ways of
                        using nicotine and sources for the substance—both here and abroad through
                        channels that are available to the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> noted that one
                        troubling aspect of the case has been the Flora Lewis article. Several
                        agencies have also investigated this article's origin and we believe we have
                        resolved this aspect of the case. The article's reference to the Chinese
                        Mission was based on a fabrication by an acquaintance of Miss Lewis. We have
                        checked out the acquaintance's story and have satisfied ourselves that he
                        had made up the story of the “plot” completely, and that the article indeed
                        was based on a total fabrication. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said he, himself, has found it hard to believe that the
                        appearance of such a <pb n="4" xml:id="d113-04" facs="d113-04"/>story only
                        five days before Mr. Wang's death was a mere coincidence but the facts now
                        force him to accept this. These facts were arrived at by several agencies of
                        both the New York and the Federal Governments.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that overall,
                        despite what he is satisfied has been our intensive investigative efforts,
                        we have not turned up any productive leads to a resolution of the case.
                        Intervention by the United States Mission and by Washington officials have
                        insured that the investigation has been even more thorough than normal.</p>
                    <p>Although the investigation has been thorough, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said he was obliged to add, however,
                        that the Police, in the meeting on Monday, had again expressed to him their
                        sincere regret, speaking as experienced professional investigators, that
                        they were unable to fingerprint and discuss the case with all the individual
                        members of the Chinese Mission.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that we fully
                        understand the Chinese reluctance to grant these Police requests. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that he and Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> had been frank with each other, but that he
                        regretted that they did not see eye to eye on this aspect of the case.
                        However, the experience of investigators here has been that details,
                        although often seemingly insignificant, turned up in the questioning of
                        innocent associates of a deceased person often are helpful. Such
                        questioning, although the Police, of course, cannot guarantee anything,
                        might have provided leads back into the American community for example and
                        this would have been of great help to the investigation and might have been
                        in our mutual interests.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d113-05" facs="d113-05"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that the only
                        way to sum up the situation is by saying that the case is at a standstill
                        but is not closed, and that the Police will continue their investigation.
                        Since the case is not resolved we would be grateful if Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> would give us the benefit of any information
                        that the Chinese side might acquire in the future and that might be useful
                        to our investigators. He said that we would also appreciate receiving any
                        word that the Chinese might have from Peking regarding the examination of
                        the body tissues that the Chinese Mission had shipped back for examination.
                        This matter had been particularly brought up in the Monday meeting. If there
                        were some information or some discovery made in Peking, this might be useful
                        in opening up new leads. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> told Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> that he is
                        grateful for the cooperation of the Chinese Mission in the handling of the
                        press and for informing us before the release of the Chinese press
                        statement. We have not had any recent inquiries and hope that this remains
                        the case. Finally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                        said that he regrets that we are unable to give the Chinese conclusive
                        answers regarding the case. He said, however, that he can assure Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> that every effort has been, and will continue
                        to be, made. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said
                        that he is sorry for Mr. Wang's family and sorry that we have not been able
                        to resolve the case. The foregoing remarks, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said, concluded his oral report. He
                        said he would be happy to discuss any aspect of the case.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>'s Reaction</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>, who reflected for a full minute before
                        speaking, said that he appreciated Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s summary report regarding Mr. Wang's death. He said
                        that “we are disappointed that so far you have not been able to resolve the
                        case. But of course we also take note of what you have said—that the case is
                        still open and that the United States side will make every effort to resolve
                        it. It remains our request that the United States side will continue to
                        investigate and to resolve the case, and that the United States side will
                        use every channel to do so.” Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>, turning
                        to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s remarks about
                        the refusal to permit fingerprinting and questioning of individual members
                        of the Chinese Mission, said simply: <pb n="6" xml:id="d113-06" facs="d113-06"/>”I have explained our position to you before. On this
                        question I have no further explanation to make.”</p>
                    <p>Referring to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s
                        request for any information on Peking's examination of Mr. Wang's tissues,
                        Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said that he would let Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> know if he receives any
                        information from Peking.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then asked Mr. Hsing if he had anything
                        to say. Mr. Hsing said he did not.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then resumed his comments, noting that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> had expressed the
                        United States' concern, and saying that “the Chinese Government also is very
                        much concerned because this happened in the Chinese Mission to the United
                        Nations and because it was caused by nicotine poisoning. This has caused us
                        great concern. It is an unusual case. Whether considered from the point of
                        view of the security of the Chinese Mission or from the point of view of the
                        responsibility of the United States Government towards other missions, it is
                        necessary for both of us to have the case resolved.</p>
                    <p>“We hope (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> continued) that we can
                        finally resolve this case. We hope that the United States side will continue
                        to exert every effort to resolve it. On this matter, we will not look into
                        the details of the United States' efforts, because that is the concern of
                        the United States side.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> confirmed that we
                        will continue to seek to resolve it, although there are no leads at this
                        time, It is in the interests of the United States Government, as well as
                        that of the Chinese Government. In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s indication that he would regret
                        that any such incident might be detrimental to relations between the two
                        countries or to the operations of the Chinese Mission, Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> said that this case is very peculiar and
                        “possibly very serious—more so than cases of other missions.” He asked if we
                        were aware of any other similar cases and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said we were unaware of any cases of
                        just this nature. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d113-07" facs="d113-07"/>continued by saying that it was
                        the nature of this case, not the individual involved that “implies a very
                        serious attempt to sabotage, to undermine the work of the Chinese Mission
                        and the relations between China and the United States. Since this is such an
                        unusual case, it should cause the United States to give serious attention to
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> replied that the
                        concern expressed by Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> about possible
                        political motives had caused us concern as well. He said that both the
                        Police and Dr. Helpern had concluded that if a person wanted to cause
                        friction between the two governments, he would not have used this kind of a
                        method to take an individual's life. The presence of nicotine in the body
                        would normally not have been detected. The theory of the Police and Dr.
                        Helpern is that if somebody had wanted to disrupt relations for political
                        purposes, nicotine would not have been used because it would have been known
                        that nicotine normally would not have been turned up in the autopsy or
                        chemical analysis. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                        said that he was “not prejudging” the matter but simply wanted to report
                        that the experts feel that nicotine was unlikely to have been chosen as a
                        method for a political murder. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        interjected that the points just made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> reflected “just one kind of
                        consideration.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> went
                        on to say that that was the only thing that Dr. Helpern and the Police said
                        on that point. He stressed again that we are not closing the door on the
                        political murder possibility. The experts' comments showed merely their
                        judgment “on methodology.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said that “most important is that in
                        the Chinese Mission in New York there was such an incident of poison death.”
                        Just as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> had
                        constantly expressed the concern felt by the United States side, the
                        incident itself will “most likely cause concern in various quarters. This
                        could be used to further create public opinion to effect the work of the
                        Chinese Mission here and this will also effect our relations with the United
                        States side. We believe, therefore, that it is also in the interests of the
                        United States side to investigate and resolve this very grave incident.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then invited Counselor Hsing to
                        comment. Hsing said that Dr. Helpern once told the Chinese side that <pb n="8" xml:id="d113-08" facs="d113-08"/>there had been such cases wherein
                        nicotine was used to end a man's life. When Dr. Helpern had reached his
                        preliminary conclusions on the cause of Mr. Wang's death, the Medical
                        Examiner had let Hsing see samples of nicotine (presumably those found in
                        fluids and tea leaves in Mr. Wang's room). Hsing said that, therefore, it is
                        “not totally impossible to detect nicotine as the cause of Mr. Wang's
                        death.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> noted again that a
                        murderer with political motivations would have wanted to have the cause of
                        death detected. Indeed, people have died before from nicotine and nicotine
                        can be traced but if the motivation for murder were political, which would
                        include a desire to have the death known to have been caused by murder, this
                        purpose might not have been achieved because nicotine ordinarily would
                        escape detection. Mr. Glennon added that he understood there had been one
                        case where nicotine had been used in a suicide. Hsing responded that the
                        sudden death of a member of the Chinese Mission, shortly after the Mission's
                        arrival in New York, presents a “serious question” which leads others to
                        raise questions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                        said that he wanted to reiterate that the United States Government shares
                        the Chinese concern: “there is no difference between us on this.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>, referring to Mr. Glennon's statement
                        about use of nicotine for suicide, said the Chinese side had also heard from
                        U.S. detectives about such incidents. He said that “we made it clear that we
                        ruled out the possibility of suicide; we completely ruled it out. We not
                        only knew Mr. Wang very well, but we also know other members of the Mission
                        very well.” Hsing added that the Chinese, in the course of the medical
                        examination and after the autopsy, had asked Dr. Helpern for further
                        analysis. Dr. Helpern also felt it to be unusual for such a young man to
                        have had such a sudden death. That is why Dr. Helpern continued his analysis
                        until he was able to conclude that nicotine was the cause, Hsing said.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said he was totally
                        in accord with the remarks made by the Chinese side. Dr. Helpern had told us
                        that he is “mystified,” as to the origin of the nicotine, and he wishes he
                        could have been of more help. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said again that he agreed with Mr. Hsing's comments.
                        Hsing said that “no matter what measures one takes to end a man's life, his
                        political purpose can be achieved. So, in other words, just because a
                        certain method is used, it cannot be said that the political <pb n="9" xml:id="d113-09" facs="d113-09"/>purpose could not be achieved.”
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said that he had
                        simply been conveying Dr. Helpern's judgment. He said that “I make no
                        conclusions because we have made no final judgment.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> that he had no more comments to make
                        about the case. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                        replied that he had made his report with regret but with satisfaction that
                        all available facts had been presented to the Chinese. He added that both
                        he, himself, in a personal capacity and the United States Government feel' a
                        desire to do everything possible and feel a deep responsibility regarding
                        the case. He said that he had nothing further to report at this time.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> concluded the discussion of Mr. Wang's
                        death by saying that his Mission would convey to his Government the facts
                        reported by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>, after a brief
                        exchange on plans to attend the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        meeting and on host country concerns about general security of foreign
                        missions in New York, asked if there had been any threats or any other
                        security matters about which the Chinese Mission was concerned. Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName>, seconded by Hsing, said that there were no
                        other such concerns; that “everything is very good.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>The meeting throughout was conducted in a low-key and serious manner. As in
                        previous meetings between the two Ambassadors, Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> did not use Mrs. Shih to interpret small
                        talk. On substance, however, Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>, as on
                        previous occasions, spoke in Chinese only, in a very low voice, directed to
                        Mrs. Shih. While listening carefully to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>'s remarks in English, Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> consistently waited to hear Mrs. Shih's
                        interpretation before showing any reaction whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese continued to maintain their forward position: insisting on the
                        likelihood of political murder, offering no assistance in proving this, and
                        refusing to consider further police access to <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Mission personnel. Nevertheless, they did not, either
                        directly or by implication, indicate suspicion <pb n="10" xml:id="d113-10" facs="d113-10"/>that the United States was not doing its best to resolve
                        the case. Doubtless, the investigators' original emphasis on the possibility
                        that Mr. Wang was taking nicotine for medicinal purposes and newspaper
                        statements that the police had suspended their investigation have led the
                        Chinese Mission to doubt the continuing vigor of the United States' effort.
                        However, the Chinese at this meeting in no way indicated that they harbor
                        such doubt. From this point of view, we believe that we have passed through
                        this stage of the case with less damage than we might have expected.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to monitor—and, where appropriate, stimulate—the Police
                        investigation, but we have no basis now for expecting that the case will be
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>It seems unlikely that Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> or his staff
                        will raise this case again with us in the immediate future unless Peking's
                        reaction to the report given by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> is stronger than that apparently felt personally by
                        Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>. We will have to be prepared,
                        nevertheless, to demonstrate to the Chinese, after the passage of a few
                        months, that the Police are continuing to do what they can to solve the
                        case.</p>
                    <p>It remains an open question as to whether or not the Chinese know more about
                        the origin of the nicotine ingested by Mr. Wang than they are telling us.
                        However, from the way they have handled the case, despite our earlier
                        concern that they were preparing to use the death against us in some
                        fashion, we now believe that this is unlikely.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston Lord</persName>, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff Member</p>
                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Tuesday, March 14, 4:40 - 6:00 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I am sorry we are late. I was caught
                        in traffic.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That often happens. I
                        missed you in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I watched television every day and saw
                        much of the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Many people saw more
                        details than I did.</p>
                    <p>I spent a lot of time with the man who headed your delegation here. I am
                        waiting to meet the first stupid Chinese. There has got to be one among 800
                        million.</p>
                    <p>Let me mention a few things to you. First, on the death of your official
                        here. We have taken a direct interest at the White House. We have talked to
                        the police department. I talked personally to Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>. I told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> first to keep it in White House
                        channels so as to see what the problem was. We have … our <pb n="2" xml:id="d114-02" facs="d114-02"/>concern was to get minimum publicity in
                        order not to give any crackpots any ideas.</p>
                    <p>Normally the protection of the Mission is the responsibility of the New York
                        Police; they have to pay for it from New York city funds. But we have told
                        them to take any additional measures that are necessary, and if it is a
                        question of money we will pay out of confidential funds. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> doesn't know this. I recommend that
                        you have a meeting anytime after today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>, the local <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> representative, and the local police representative. We
                        will keep a personal eye on it from my office, and if there is anything that
                        is lacking, will you let us know. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> has been instructed to develop a specific plan together
                        with you. We are going to have undercover people in the mission and we will
                        take other measures. If there is anything you can think of that is not being
                        done, and you will let us know, if it is humanly possible we will do it.</p>
                    <p>Do you have any special ideas now that I could take care of?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I agree with what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has just said, that we prevent as
                        far as possible publicity to prevent any uproar in the public, because it
                        would help the unveiling of the plot. I once briefed Mr. Phillips… .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On Saturday.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: He originally hoped to have a
                        discussion with us earlier, but I preferred to wait until today's meeting. I
                        told Ambassador Phillips that we have made a very careful study of the life
                        history of Mr. Wang Hsi-tsanh and the internal situation of our Mission, and
                        we have completely ruled out the possibility of suicide by Mr. Wang
                        Hsi-tsanh or any other internal reason related to it. It seems to be that it
                        is a deliberate murder.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But why him?</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d114-03" facs="d114-03"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It is aimed at creating a political
                        event. With regard to the security issue, I told Mr. Phillips that it is not
                        necessary to strengthen security measures just on the appropriate number of
                        policemen; it is necessary to strengthen other fields.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to get
                        undercover people in the kitchen and find other undercover people so we can
                        find who might have done this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I wonder if you have received the
                        report by Dr. Helpern, the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. We have
                        given the report to Mr. Phillips.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have not actually
                        seen the report, but I have seen the report of Mr. Phillips. There is no
                        question about what has happened.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As to what kind of security measures
                        to enforce, we leave that to you to decide.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Ambassador, first
                        of all we are embarrassed and outraged. Second, the White House will take a
                        personal interest in the matter. You can be sure that even though you are
                        dealing with others, we are fully involved. We will do everything humanly
                        possible to prevent a repetition.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That is all I want to say about this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Feel free to call me
                        any time, and if anything at all is needed, you can be sure that it will be
                        done. So you will call Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> tomorrow or set up a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>, and he will be prepared. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> doesn't
                        know about our meetings any longer. I will bring him in only if United
                        Nationè business is involved.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d114-04" facs="d114-04"/>
                    <p>The second point I want to mention is real estate.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: (smiles) Thank you for your
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand from my
                        sources that you have not made a definite offer.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yesterday our lawyer told us that he
                        had struck a final bargain on the Motor Inn on prices. They are now
                        preparing the final document.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. Here is the
                        problem, and I will be honest with you about the two months delay. My
                        friend, a member of the Rockefeller organization, tells me that your lawyer
                        is not experienced in real estate, but an old friend. Therefore, according
                        to my friend, it will take your lawyer a little longer than it would an
                        expert to get the matter completed. If you want to—this is entirely up to
                        you—we could find an expert in real estate law if your lawyer were willing.
                        Mr. Marshall thinks that it could save you between three to four weeks. It
                        is entirely up to you. It would speed it up a little, but, it will take four
                        weeks anyway to complete the formalities. My people think it would take
                        your, lawyer about eight weeks. You don't have to change lawyers; only your
                        lawyer would have to be willing to take an expert as an adviser.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: When we go back we will consider this
                        'question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is entirely up to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> Because according to our lawyer in a
                        day or two we can sign a contract.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But there…</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: And the owner of the Inn says that
                        within ten days they will be cleared out.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d114-05" facs="d114-05"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You could move in?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no problem
                        then. You may have a better lawyer than anyone recognizes.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked the local
                        intermediary who was serving refreshments to stay out of earshot during the
                        next portion of the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to report two
                        conversations to you that I had with the Soviet Ambassador which I think
                        will be of some interest to the Prime Minister and Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName> Chiengying. The Soviet Ambassador came
                        to see me on Thursday, March 9 and said that they had information from
                        Chinese sources that I had given, during the October visit to China, that I
                        had given to Chinese authorities information about the “dislocation”—I am
                        giving you his words—of Soviet forces on your border and the location of
                        Soviet missile installations on your border. He said that if this were true,
                        it would be taken with the greatest gravity in Moscow. I said to him that it
                        must have been Chinese sources from Taiwan, and made no other comment.</p>
                    <p>He came back the next day and said that they were Chinese sources from the
                        mainland who thought that matters were going too far. I said one, I never
                        discuss my conversations with him, and two, it was complete nonsense, and a
                        provocation. This is the position we will maintain. But I thought the Prime
                        Minister might want to know this. That's really all I need to say about it.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> nods)</p>
                    <p>I think this could be what we call a “fishing expedition. “ (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> smiles and explains the phrase to the
                        interpreter.) That is, he is simply trying to see what my reaction was.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d114-06" facs="d114-06"/>
                    <p>They are also spreading rumors to this effect about the July visit, but that
                        is on a low level. You can take a look at it - this is an internal memo.
                        (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> loans the Ambassador a
                        copy of the <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">John Scali</persName> memo to him -
                        attached at Tab A.) This man does not know anything about our relations he
                        is one of our public relations advisers. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> reads the memo slowly and carefully.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This sort of thing I
                        don't propose to pay any attention to. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> chuckles.) But the other point might be
                        worthy to be looked into in Peking. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        nods.) If they want to make any comment, it would be interesting.</p>
                    <p>While we are preparing for … we will announce this Thursday—we have already
                        talked to the Prime Minister but wanted you to know—that we will go to
                        Moscow on May 22. I have refused an invitation to go to Moscow prior to the
                        summit similar to the visit I made to Peking. So I am doing preparations in
                        Washington with the Soviet Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Now, as you know, we agreed in Peking that after the summit I would come to
                        Peking and talk to the Prime Minister in greater detail about it.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> nods.) I wanted to let you know our
                        present impression is that the Soviet strategy, is to conclude a very large
                        number of agreements with us. Every agreement that has been negotiated for
                        three years, every negotiation that has been going on for years, is suddenly
                        moving simultaneously. As the President told the Prime Minister, we will
                        conclude those agreements which we think are in our interest, and we will
                        conclude no agreement which is directed at the People's Republic.</p>
                    <p>For example, France has wanted to join the agreement on nuclear accidents
                        that we have concluded with the Soviet Union, and we have told France we
                        don't want this. If France wants to make an agreement, it should agree
                        separately with the Soviet Union, because <pb n="7" xml:id="d114-07" facs="d114-07"/>we don't want the situation where every country has
                        concluded an agreement except the People's Republic. You haven't asked us to
                        do this; I am just telling you.</p>
                    <p>(Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> speaks to the interpreter in Chinese,
                        but there is no translation.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have agreements
                        which we are now discussing with the Soviet Union. You are familiar with the
                        strategic arms negotiations, and there is no change in that situation. There
                        are the following bilateral discussions going on (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> again comments in Chinese with no
                        translation):</p>
                    <p>— A possible sale of some American grain in the Soviet Union, and an American
                        delegation headed by the Secretary of Agriculture will visit Moscow in
                        April.</p>
                    <p>— A settlement of lend lease debts; these talks will start within the next
                        two to three weeks.</p>
                    <p>— We will start talks about the possibility of creating a joint committee for
                        scientific exchange; similarly an agreement about pollution and the
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>— You know that we are negotiating an agreement on health matters.</p>
                    <p>— And there is a proposal to have an agreement on a joint space exercise, the
                        docking of which is called a space bus. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> demonstrates docking with his hands.)</p>
                    <p>— And finally a maritime discussion on the opening of ports. This is largely
                        technical on how much advance notice has to be given.</p>
                    <p>The basic problem is that all these are on the agenda, but they have suddenly
                        started moving simultaneously. The intent is very obvious. But I think you
                        understand our general purposes now, and there is no possibility of any
                        collusion on any political matters. Of course, we are prepared to make
                        agreements with you in any area that we make with the Soviet Union, but that
                        is up to you.</p>

                    <p>As for the President's itinerary in the Soviet Union, he will go to Moscow
                        and Leningrad and one other city not yet picked, but it will not be East of
                        the Urals. On the way home he will stop in Iran as you know Iran is a good
                        friend of Pakistan—to underline our concern for South Asia. But this has not
                        yet been announced.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to inform the Prime Minister also about a call on me by the Indian
                        Ambassador. I could spend my life explaining the Shanghai Communique.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) You should bring your
                        colleague back over here, and we will do it jointly. The first week after
                        Peking I couldn't get used to the change; I used to meet him from 10:00 to
                        3:00 in the morning. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>The Indian Ambassador asked me what the phrase “Asia-Pacific” meant in the
                        Communique and wanted to know whether… he thought it did not apply to India
                        and thought it meant that we might agree to Chinese hegemony over India. I
                        said that first, I was not a spokesman for Chinese policy, and second, that
                        the People's Republic had said that it did not consider itself a superpower
                        and rejects power politics of any kind. I said as far as the U.S. were
                        concerned, we rejected the hegemony of any outside country over the
                        subcontinent and of any country within the subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>I share these conversations only because it is conceivable to me that people
                        who do not particularly appreciate our relations may spread various
                        versions, and I wanted you to know directly whether we discussed your
                        affairs with the Indians and the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the President told the Prime Minister when he was in Peking that
                        after Indian troops were withdrawn we were considering recognizing
                        Bangladesh, and the Prime Minister asked us to be sure to let you know a
                        week ahead of time. Our present plan is, now that Indian troops have been
                        withdrawn, to recognize Bangladesh during the first week of April. But we
                        have not yet told the bureaucracy, so if your government wants to express a
                        view, we can still adjust our timing. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>

                    <p>These are the political things that I have to discuss with you. There are a
                        number of other things which really belong in the Paris Channel, but I just
                        wanted to mention to you.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and Senator <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> have written a letter to the Prime
                        Minister. This is a copy. (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> shows a copy of the <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>
                        letter to Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> at Tab B.) You can keep the
                        copy. We will send the original to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName>, and he will give it to your Ambassador in Paris on
                        Monday.</p>
                    <p>Now these are two leaders of the Senate, and they are terribly spoiled.
                        (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) They are not used to the bad
                        treatment the Executive Branch always gets—not by the Chinese but by the
                        press. This is to prepare you, and to give Peking a head start. They would
                        like to come for from two to three weeks, either starting April 16 or April
                        27. They haven't put that in there—I have forced them to write in a very
                        general way, but I am giving you this information. They would like to bring
                        their wives. Each would like to bring two staff men. The President's and my
                        recommendation is that if you permit one staff man, he can do less
                        mischief.</p>
                    <p>(At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> was called to
                        the phone for a couple of minutes. There was further discussion of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> trip.)</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How should we handle
                        this? Should we submit this letter to your Ambassador in Paris?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (Cuts off the bottom of
                        a memo from Clark MacGregor to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and hands over the remainder containing questions
                        on the <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> visit.) You have more of my papers
                        than some of my colleagues. (Laughter on both sides.) There has never been
                        reciprocity either. (MacGregor memo at Tab C)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: These are questions… .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They were put to me by
                        our Congressional liaison man. This is not an official communication to you.
                        They do not know that you have these questions.</p>
                    <p>I don't want to interfere in your affairs, but the easiest way to handle this
                        would be in response to their letter, you could volunteer some of this
                        information. In that manner; you would eliminate many questions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Ithink the original copy of the letter
                        should be handed over to our Ambassador in Paris, and the questions related
                        to it should be discussed by the two Ambassadors in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Should we do it in
                        Paris?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes, these can be discussed in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Unless there are some
                        questions you prefer not be put to you, because we can control it. I think
                        the questions here can all be discussed in Paris.</p>
                    <p>We appreciated the rapid reply to the request about the two House leaders. We
                        will submit a letter from them, say a week after the other one.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d114-11" facs="d114-11"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You mean after the letter of the
                        leaders of the Senate is delivered in Paris?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we will deliver
                        the House letter. They should not go at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Now we get a great many questions from people wanting to visit the People's
                        Republic, as I am sure you do. What should we do with them?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I think this question has been
                        discussed in Peking during your visit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Should these questions
                        be submitted in Paris directly or through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Ordinary people coming such as
                        business men, scholars, scientists, and others can supply their applications
                        through ordinary channels, that is the Chinese Embassy nearest them.
                        Generally that place is Ottawa.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They don't have to do
                        it in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Not necessarily. It is more convenient
                        to be nearer. I think during the discussions in Peking the Chinese side told
                        you that we are limited in equipment and documentation to receive American
                        guests, so that it must be done gradually.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We understand. We are
                        not recommending any particular number. We just want to know how to respond.
                        I have a nightclub singer who wants to perform in your country. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) And a comedy team.</p>
                    <p>Alright, we will do the following. Ordinary people we will tell to go to
                        Ottawa, and it is entirely up to you how to handle them. Maybe the
                        Ambassador should say this to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> on Monday when they meet, because nobody knows I am
                        seeing you. I will instruct him to ask the question.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d114-12" facs="d114-12"/>
                    <p>Especially important people we will raise through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> in Paris. If I ever want to mention
                        somebody, I would take the liberty of doing this with you. This will happen
                        very rarely.</p>
                    <p>I am being harassed about your tabletennis team. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) But I want you to know that having
                        seen your players, if they lose one game when they come here, I know that
                        you are being polite. But I won't tell anyone. We will raise that also in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>One gentleman who I know quite well and who would like to visit the People's
                        Republic is Joseph Alsop. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> nods.) I
                        know he is very well disposed toward the People's Republic. Of course, the
                        decision is up to you. He should apply in Ottawa also?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes, he could go to Ottawa or write to
                        Ottawa. If he wants to contact us first, he can do so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Whom should he
                        contact?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: The person in charge of these matters,
                        Mr. Kao.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I also want to say that
                        I read with embarrassment many stories about the President's visit. I hope
                        you know enough about the bureaucratic maneuvering to be able to identify
                        the sources. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> nods.) I hope you have
                        been able to see that anything coming from the White House has been pointing
                        to a high regard of the human and political qualities of the leaders with
                        whom we have had the privilege of speaking.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will report what you have said to
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and Vice Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh</persName>.</p>
                    <p>If you don't have anything more to say, I have … .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have something?</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d114-13" facs="d114-13"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes (laughs nervously and reads from a
                        piece of paper, attached at Tab D).</p>
                    <p>“In the fortnight since the conclusion of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit, the United States has
                        carried out increasingly large-scale bombings against Democratic Republic of
                        Vietnam. On March 10 the United States Government further proclaimed the
                        week from March 26 to April 2 as the so-called National Week of Concern for
                        Prisoners of War.</p>
                    <p>“The Chinese Government cannot but express great concern over this. The
                        Chinese Government would like to state frankly that the United States will
                        not be able to attain its goal by this line of action. If the United States
                        Government truly wants to bring about the early release of prisoners of war,
                        it should accept the seven points and the two-point elaboration put forward
                        by the Provisional Revolutionary Government and enter into earnest
                        negotiations with the other side.</p>
                    <p>“Any attempt to exert pressure by war threat can only arouse the peoples of
                        the three countries of Indochina to ever stronger resistance. With the war
                        continuing and the casualties in the three Indochina countries increasing,
                        how are the prisoners of war to be released? The Chinese people, who share
                        weal and woe with the Indochinese people, can only express indignation and
                        support the three Indochinese peoples' war of resistance to the end.</p>
                    <p>“It is hoped that the U.S. Government will give serious consideration to this
                        view.”</p>
                    <p>Upon instruction of the Chinese Government, I have transmitted this message
                        to the United States Government and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d114-14" facs="d114-14"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Have you a copy?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It is not an official copy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Only for our records.
                        We will not treat it as an official communication. We will destroy it after
                        we are through with it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: There may be some mistakes. (He handed
                        it over.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Don't worry about it.
                        Just a technical point. This communication will go only to the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>I want you to understand that we take any communication from the Chinese
                        Government extremely seriously, and I want to answer you frankly.</p>
                    <p>First, it is not true that we have engaged in large-scale bombing of North
                        Vietnam since leaving China. This is really for the information of the Prime
                        Minister. I don't want to get in an argument with him, but you are not
                        getting the correct information. We were accused last week by the North
                        Vietnamese of bombing from March 1-6. I investigated it. We had given no
                        authority, and there was no intensive bombing in there.</p>
                    <p>Secondly - again, I had no interest in raising the Vietnam issue with you,
                        but this is a frank exchange of opinions. Before we left for Peking, the
                        North Vietnamese Government proposed a meeting to us on March 15 in Paris.
                        We accepted this for March 20 for technical reasons. On March 1, they
                        accepted March 20—(correcting himself) on February 29 they accepted March
                        20. On March 7, after I had already made arrangements for a secret visit
                        which is rather complex for me, they cancelled it again and proposed a date
                        in April. It is a very peculiar procedure.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: April 1?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They proposed April
                        15.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d114-15" facs="d114-15"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: You mean negotiations or secret
                        talks?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Secret talks. But I
                        can't come the 15th, so I have to be delayed a week. It is a very peculiar
                        method of proceeding.</p>
                    <p>I would like the Prime Minister to know, as we have already said to him, that
                        we are prepared, we would like to talk to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
                        honestly and openly and in the spirit of justice. We are not seeking a
                        military victory, and we hope finally these negotiations will start.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime I want to assure the Prime Minister that we will not increase
                        our military operations over North Vietnam unless there is an offensive on
                        their part.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will convey your explanation. I have
                        also noted—this is outside the instructions of our Government—I have also
                        noted from the press there are four aircraft carriers of the U.S. which are
                        concentrated in nearby areas.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is only because of
                        our concern of an attack, an offensive by the Democratic Republic of
                        Vietnam. We will not be the first to take an offensive step.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I don't think it is necessary for me
                        to make further explanations, because the basic view of the Chinese side is
                        expressed in the communication.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your point
                        of view. I wanted to tell the Prime Minister. We are not engaged in
                        propaganda. What I tell you represents our real view, and I wanted the Prime
                        Minister to understand it. I know he doesn't agree with it.</p>
                    <p>Is that all?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have nothing more.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All of us have the
                        warmest recollections of our visit to Peking, and I am constantly being
                        accused of having been taken in by the Chinese, and it is a problem to me. I
                        have certain sentimental feelings about my trip.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d114-16" facs="d114-16"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: “Taken in?”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I mean “charmed.” All
                        of us have really friendly recollections and will work on this policy with
                        great seriousness.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Some Ambassador told me that they
                        studied our communique, and they published the support of their government
                        for the communique. I am referring to Yugloslavia. I think Romania is very
                        happy to.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Ambassador, it is
                        always a pleasure to see you. I may go on vacation some time during the next
                        three weeks for a week. I have not decided yet. I will let you know which
                        week. General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> is available.
                        Please feel free to get in touch with me at any time.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: In our last meeting with Mr. Howe I
                        expressed our thanks for the President's and your concern for the Chinese
                        Mission, as well as the concern you expressed in Peking on the question of a
                        house. I hope in the near future the problem will be solved. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.) Whether our lawyer is an expert or
                        not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am sure he is
                        capable.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: (in English) Whether he is capable of
                        settling in shortest possible time or not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We'll help, but if it
                        is 10 days, no one can be faster than that.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: But the matter of the first question,
                        the death of Mr. Wang by poisoning, we hope to make a serious investigation
                        and unveil the plot.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will make one. You
                        understand our system of government. It places the police here outside our
                        jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>But we will make the maximum effort that we can, and we use federal police to
                        assist the investigation. I will give it the personal attention of the White
                        House.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d114-17" facs="d114-17"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Thank you for your reception
                        today.</p>
                    <p>(There were then some closing pleasantries during which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and then Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> expressed their happiness at the prospects of
                        dealing with one another. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added that he had warm memories and associated
                        Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> with his first trip to China which was
                        quite an experience. The two Chinese then left for their Hotel.)</p>

                    <p>23 March 1972</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: 45th Meeting with the Chinese - Paris, 5 March 1972</p>
                    <p>1. On the evening of 4 March 1972, Tsao called me and said that the
                        Ambassador had learned that I was leaving shortly and insisted that I must
                        come to dinner on Sunday night—they could not allow me to leave without
                        dinner together. I agreed to do so.</p>
                    <p>2. On Sunday evening, the fifth of March, I went to the Chinese Embassy
                        Residence on Boulevard du Chateau in Neuilly—on foot, leaving the car at a
                        considerable distance. Met at the gate by Wei and at the door by Tsao, I was
                        taken into the Red Room, where the Ambassador waited. After a drink, we
                        repaired to a large dining room I had never seen before and sat down to
                        dinner. On the wall was a tapestry of “<persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> with the representatives of the ethnic minorities”
                        covering the entire wall. It must have been more than twenty feet across.
                        The Ambassador said that they had ordered it from a factory in Shanghai to
                        fit that wall.</p>
                    <p>3. We then started what turned out to be about a fourteencourse meal with
                        Chinese flower wine and French Chateau Haut Brion of an extremely old
                        vintage. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang Chen</persName> said,
                        “We could not let you go like this, even though we have completed our task
                        together. You have become old friend, and we wanted to have a meal together
                        before you left. We cannot, unfortunately, give you shark fin soup as that
                        takes a week to prepare and we did not have enough notice. Whatever happens
                        in the future, we at least successfully performed our mission and put our
                        chiefs in contact. The fact that we were both soldiers made it easier for us
                        to work together. Each understood what moved the other. Now you are going to
                        more important functions.”</p>
                    <p>4. I broke in to ask if he knew where I was going, and he grinned and said,
                        “Yes, I know where you are going.” He then drank a toast to me. <pb n="2" xml:id="d116-02" facs="d116-02"/>I drank one to him, who had always been
                        so helpful and understanding to me, especially during the early days of our
                        contacts when we knew little about one another. I said to him, “You know
                        that in my new job I will always serve my country faithfully, but I will
                        always remember the friendship you showed me and the importance of the
                        friendship between our two countries and peoples (another toast). He replied
                        that he would have thought less of me if I had not expressed the will to
                        serve my country faithfully.</p>
                    <p>5. The Ambassador then said that he felt a historic mission had been
                        accomplished—doors closed between our peoples for nearly a quarter of a
                        century had been opened; the President had had a good visit to Peking;
                        almost everyone seemed pleased except the Soviets and Americans who are
                            pro-<persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> or pro-Soviet.
                        I said that some pro-Soviet elements exist everywhere, even in China (he
                        grinned) but that the overwhelming mass of the American people are in
                        favor—even, as he had noted previously, Senator Goldwater and Governor
                        Reagan. He said he believed that the American press had by and large been
                        satisfied with the treatment that they had received in China. Eighty-seven
                        newsmen might seem like a small figure to us, but to them it was enormous
                        and without precedent. No Chief of State who had ever visited the People's
                        Republic had ever brought more than eight or ten pressmen with him. Besides,
                        the Americans, coming from a highly industrialized and technological
                        society, had requirements which were different from those of the average
                        visitor to the People's Republic.</p>
                    <p>6. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> asked me whether the Soviets had
                        commented to me about the President's visit to China. I said that none of
                        them had, which made me believe that they had had instructions not to do so.
                        All of them, however, had asked my officers or me what the President would
                        bring up when he went to Moscow. When I told them I did not know, they had
                        asked, “Will he bring up the Middle East?” I had replied cryptically that I
                        thought that depended on what the Soviets did. He laughed and said this must
                        have confused them.</p>
                    <p>7. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then said that he felt that the
                        negotiations had been completed successfully because so few people had known
                        about them. In his embassy only Tsao and Wei had known. I agreed, saying <pb n="3" xml:id="d116-03" facs="d116-03"/>that in our case only my
                        secretary had known. He wondered how many people in the French government
                        did—“because they listen to the telephones and watch us.” I said that I
                        thought that knowledge of the contacts was very closely held in the French
                        government. He agreed. At this point, a historic event occurred—I ate my
                        first 100-year egg.</p>
                    <p>8. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> then went back to the beginning of
                        our contacts, saying that I had shown good judgment in coming to his
                        residence early in the morning before he went to the chancery. I confessed
                        that I had watched the residence for several mornings before my first
                        contact, to see what time he drove to work, and that was why I had come at
                        the time at which I had. He repeated, “Good judgment.” He said that he
                        understood that after my departure further arrangements would be made to
                        ensure contact between the two governments but did not elaborate.</p>
                    <p>9. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said that, regardless of political
                        or ideological differences, we had become friends—they regarded me almost as
                        a member of the family—and he hoped that, either in China or the United
                        States, we would meet again as relations between our two countries
                        normalized. He noted that we had met forty-five times. As he rose from the
                        table, he raised his glass and toasted “our forty-sixth meeting, wherever it
                        may be.” He then said that I would always be welcome in China. The President
                        and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had taken
                        courageous action to reopen the door between our peoples, and he had told
                        Peking of the part I had played in this. He then presented me with a green
                        Chinese vase on a wooden stand, and I gave him a book of colored photographs
                        of the United States with text in French. This time he himself walked me to
                        the gate of the embassy residence, and we shook hands.</p>

                    <p>JUST HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR <persName>HUANG</persName>, WHICH
                        WAS EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY. I HAD NOT ANNOUNCED THE MEETING TO THE
                        PRESS, BUT THE CHINESE DID. AS THE AMBASSADOR SAW ME TO MY CAR, SEVERAL
                        PRESS MEMBERS WERE THERE AND QUESTIONED ME. I MERELY STATED WE HAD A
                        FRIENDLY CONTACT WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST OF MANY AND THAT WAS ALL. NOW WE
                        ARE BEING QUERIED BY THE PRESS, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE GREATLY INSTRUCTIONS

                    <p>THE AMBASSADOR IS PAYING ME A RETURN CALL AT 1100 THURSDAY. HE COULD POSSIBLY
                        ANNOUNCE SUCH A CALL, AND I WONDER IF YOU THINK IT WISE FOR ME TO ANNOUNCE

                        TO SEND YOU HIS WARMEST REGARDS. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY CORDIAL. HE HAD A
                        CHINESE WITH HIM WHO INTERPRETED THE CONVERSATIONS INTO FRENCH. ALSO PRESENT
                        WAS MR. TSAO, FIRST SECRETARY. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT FOR MAJOR MATTERS HE
                        WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME. FOR LESS IMPORTANT, ROUTINE THINGS, HE ASKED ME TO
                        DESIGNATE SOMEBODY HERE AT THE EMBASSY THAT COULD DEAL WITH MR. TSAO. I TOLD
                        HIM THAT AT PRESENT I HAD NOT CHOSEN ANYBODY FOR THIS ROLE, BUT AS HE
                        PRESSED THE POINT, I HAVE DESIGNATED ALLEN HOLMES, POLITICAL COUNSELOR, IN
                        WHOM I HAVE THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE AND WHO WILL SEND NO MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON
                        WITHOUT CLEARING IT WITH ME. HE WAS ALSO PLEASED BY MY ASSURANCES THAT ANY
                        MESSAGES FROM ME WOULD BE DIRECTLY TO YOU AND THE PRESIDENT, THEREBY
                        AVOIDING ANY LEAKS. HE OBVIOUSLY IS WELL INFORMED ABOUT JACK ANDERSON.</p>
                    <p>AS I MENTIONED IN MY OTHER CABLE, HE IS RETURNING MY CALL THURSDAY AT 1100. I
                        DID MENTION TO HIM THAT YOU ALL WERE EXTREMELY PLEASED BY THE WARM WELCOME
                        YOU RECEIVED IN CHINA, THE RESULT OF WHICH WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE NUMEROUS
                        REQUESTS FOR VISITS, WHICH HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD AND WHICH HE DID NOT PROTEST.
                        WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INSTRUCTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR MY THURSDAY MEETING.
                        HAVE SENT SECRETARY A SHORT MESSAGE MERELY STATING WE HAD HAD A FRIENDLY
                        DISCUSSION.</p>
                    <p>ON MY RETURN TO MY OFFICE WAS INFORMED THAT JAPANESE EMBASSY HERE IS MOST

                        <item>My April 3 Mission to New York</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Here is a brief rundown of this evening's mission to New York which, as I
                        phoned in to Al, was accomplished uneventfully.</p>
                    <p>At 8:30 p.m. I walked into the front entrance of the Chinese Mission from the
                        Amsterdam Avenue side, past a single unquestioning policeman. The lobby
                        contained eight to ten uncurious Chinese and an atmosphere of having just
                        moved in. Miss Shih greeted me at the door and immediately escorted me into
                        the elevator. We went to the second floor and proceeded to Room 204, a
                        little way down the hail to the left, a modest suite.</p>
                    <p>Miss Shih served me jasmine tea, and after two sips worth of small talk on
                        the weather and the Lincoln Center, I handed her an envelope with our
                        message inside it. She read it carefully, with serious countenance, for
                        about five minutes. She then impassively said that they would transmit it
                        immediately to their Government and let us know if they had any instructions
                        as a result of it. She had no questions or comment. She then poured me a
                        second cup of tea.</p>
                    <p>Then (as you instructed) I made an informal comment on a personal basis along
                        the following lines. I had been with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on all his trips and sat in on all his meetings,
                        and I knew personally that there was no policy he believed in more than
                        improving relations with the People's Republic of China. This was the spirit
                        in which we approached our relationship and one which we were prepared to
                        apply also to North Vietnam. And this was the framework of the message I had
                        just given her. It was also in this light that we had issued the
                        instructions concerning the Paracel Islands contained in the message.
                        Frankly speaking, I added, this had been a very difficult issue within our
                        Government.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d119-02" facs="d119-02"/>
                    <p>She nodded understanding and then resumed the small talk in a relaxed
                        fashion. For a few more minutes we discussed the varied scenery in the
                        United States which I hoped she would get to see and the impending visit of
                        the Chinese table tennis team. (I noted that they had managed to lose one
                        match in Canada which was very diplomatic, and quickly added that it was
                        friendship not competition that counted.)</p>
                    <p>When she started to pour me another cup of tea, I politely refused saying
                        that I had to leave in order to catch the last plane back to Washington. She
                        then escorted me down the elevator and out to the front door. We shook hands
                        at the entrance and I walked back toward Amsterdam Avenue.</p>
                    <p>A few miscellaneous comments: The street was quiet and relatively deserted,
                        with no one hanging around. There seems to be only one entrance, with the
                        garage right next to it, facing on the side of <persName corresp="#p_LGA1">Lincoln</persName> Center. Miss Shih was very friendly both before and
                        after we did our business. I was friendly without being effusive. When I
                        commented that there must be many empty rooms in the inn, she said that more
                        people were coming. When I said that I hoped this included families, she
                        said “not children.”</p>

                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: There was not too
                        much traffic tonight.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: There was not too much. It took about
                        twenty minutes to get here.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: We got in quickly
                        from the airport. Everything was going the other way.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: (Taking out a type-written note) There
                        are two things which we would like to notify General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. (Reading from note)</p>
                    <p>“From 1840 hours on March 18, 1972 to 0935 hours on March 20, 1972, one U.S.
                        warship, the George K. MacKenzie intruded into Chinese territorial waters
                        near Tung Island, 16°, 14', 6” north, 112°, 43', 48” east, off the Hsi Sha
                        Islands, Kwantung Province, China.</p>
                    <p>On March 19, one U.S. military aircraft further intruded into Chinese air
                        space on five successive occasions: 0738 to 0759 hours, 1500 to 1504 hours,
                        1510 to 1517 hours, 1546 to 1644 hours, and 1743 to 1802 hours.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d120-02" facs="d120-02"/>
                    <p>The Chinese Government has consistently in public warned the United States
                        against intrusion, on whatever grounds, into the territorial air space or
                        waters by U.S. aircraft or warships. Considering the fact that the above
                        intrusion occurred shortly after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to China, we are raising this matter privately
                        and asking the U.S. side to guard against similar occasions.”</p>
                    <p>(<persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> check with Miss Shih on the
                        island names and coordinates.)</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I was not aware of
                        this, and if these kinds of things happen, we are usually notified. In the
                        first place, it is against our policy to do that. We have been especially
                        careful during the period before and since the President's trip. All we can
                        do is investigate and find out what the circumstances were, and we will come
                        back to you with a detailed explanation about what this is about.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As stated in the verbal message, the
                        Chinese side wishes that the U.S. side will guard against such intrusions
                        into Chinese territorial waters and airspace.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I will, of course,
                        report this immediately to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and we will get the facts. I think the location
                        you mention is off the southern coast of China, an island off the southern
                        coast, and there have been some incidents of armed vessels moving from North
                        Vietnam down to South Vietnam. These are usually the subject of surveillance
                        which could have resulted in the penetration, which, of course, was not
                        authorized. I prefer to get the facts. These are generally the source of the
                        air activity; several attempts have been made in recent months to move
                        contraband into South Vietnam. We will get an answer as soon as we can. I
                        can assure you that penetrations of your territorial waters and air space
                        are not authorized.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As stated in the message, the Chinese
                        Government has consistently issued public warnings against such intrusion on
                        whatever grounds. Now we are raising the matter privately and ask the U.S.
                        side to assure against the occurrence of such incidents.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes, I
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: On the one hand we will wait for the
                        results you mentioned. On the other hand, the Chinese side has raised the
                        matter on the basis of facts and has asked the U.S. side to guard against
                        reoccurrences of such situations, because this would be harmful to the
                        Chinese situation.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d120-03" facs="d120-03"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Well, I think the
                        best way to proceed on this … assurances that are verbal mean nothing if
                        actions run counter to verbal assurances. I will have to have an
                        investigation made. We have no facts from which to talk on my side. Until I
                        get the facts I can do little but report the matter. I don't mean to
                        question that the event happened; a similar event occurred when I was in
                        China with respect to a drone aircraft. When I looked into the
                        circumstances—this didn't make it right—it was an accident. While that does
                        not excuse it, it puts the motives into the proper context.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have noted your statement. In
                        principle, I think the U.S. side must affirm, at least in principle, that
                        you will assure against the reoccurrence of such incidents. As to the
                        incidents themselves, we will wait until you have reported and made an
                        investigation.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I have already made
                        clear that if anything like this occurs, it is against our policy. Our
                        policy is very clear. I don't think anyone can categorically say that it
                        cannot occur and never occur, because they might. If they do occur, they are
                        unauthorized and may require disciplinary action or whatever is
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>I can assure you that there is no policy that permits intrusion into
                        territorial waters or air space.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As to the authority, what do you mean?
                        Authority from what quarter?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: There can be no
                        authority to do it. It would be contrary to policy. So there can be
                        noauthority, and if it happened, it either happened against orders or by
                        mistake.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Thank you for your clarification. That
                        is all I want to say.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Those are the two
                        items you wished to discuss today?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I think it would be
                        good to take this opportunity to raise two minor administrative things. I
                        understand you are moving shortly. Could you be sure to have Miss Shih call
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> and give the new telephone
                        number when you move?</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d120-04" facs="d120-04"/>
                    <p>Miss Shih: I have it with me. (She takes out a slip of paper and hands it to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> with the address and
                        telephone number of the <persName corresp="#p_LGA1">Lincoln</persName> Motor
                        Inn, the new Chinese Mission at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.) If
                        there is any change we will let you know. We will probably move early next
                        week.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We will probably move next Monday or
                        Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: You must be happy to do
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Miss Shih: You should ask for me. We will get a direct line later.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: The second point is
                        that I talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                        yesterday, and I understand that you had a discussion with him on security
                        arrangements. I want to emphasize that we stand ready fully, along with the
                        security people - both the local police and the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> - to help you; and to be sure that the new arrangements are
                        as secure as possible; and also to move to investigate as carefully as we
                        can the circumstances of the very unfortunate incident which occurred
                        earlier.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We appreciate very much your new
                        arrangements for security measures in our new home. And Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> has expressed concern about our
                        security. We believe that you will take the necessary measures according to
                        the need of the situation.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the unfortunate death of Mr. Wang, a staff member of the
                        Chinese Mission, by poison, I talked with Ambassador Phillips as well as
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> the other day. We
                        have raised the matter that we hope the U.S. side will make a serious
                        investigation and unveil the plot and have the culprits punished. This was
                        an incident of political murder. We also believe that the U.S. side will
                        give it serious consideration.</p>
                    <p>As to how to proceed with the investigation and what kind of people to take
                        part, we leave the matter to the U.S. side to decide. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> said he would like to have some
                        people sent to investigate the environment before we move. We are ready to
                        contact him tomorrow to make arrangements.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Very good. I am sure
                        the Ambassador knows we were outraged by the incident. We are going to make
                        every facility and technical skills that we have available to ensure that
                        such a thing can never happen again and hopefully trace out the source of
                        this crime.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d120-05" facs="d120-05"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We appreciate your attention to this
                        incident, and we hope that you will get to the bottom of this matter
                        quickly.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes. We hope so too.
                        Everyone is giving his fullest attention, and we think there may have to be
                        some discussion with you. Our people did not want to push nor to make
                        themselves a problem. We want to be sure to do everything tactfully and
                        carefully and in accordance with your wishes.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: As to how to pursue the investigation
                        and get to the bottom of the case - this is with respect to the U.S. side—we
                        will leave it entirely to you to decide.</p>
                    <p>Both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> and Ambassador
                        Phillips have expressed the desire that they don't want the news to leak out
                        so that the press makes big news in the papers and makes for big
                        speculation.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I think that is
                        important, but enough time has gone by so that I would like to tell
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> that if necessary to
                        interrogate your people or look at your facilities at the hotel and ask
                        questions about the habits and the whereabouts of the victim, that he feels
                        free to do it. I think sometimes it is a case of protocol and sensitivity.
                        It is like two men waiting at the door and no one goes through it. We want
                        to get to the bottom of the thing as quickly as possible. We think that is
                        the most important thing.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We understand the desire expressed by
                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> and Phillips to
                        avoid newspaper reports about the matter, and this is for the convenience of
                        the investigation and unveiling the plot. So we can agree to it. We will try
                        to do our best to prevent the news from getting to the papers. In my talks
                        with Ambassador Phillips I mentioned the above suggestions.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: That is very good,
                        and we are all pleased at this way of approaching the matter. It is
                        important that the kind of investigation that is necessary is completed
                        before you move to a new location and new facilities. There is a lot of
                        information on facilities and procedures that may no longer be evident to
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: About the on-the-spot investigation, I
                        will contact Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> as soon
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Excellent and I will
                        … We would like to be sure that our federal investigative assets are
                        included, so there is no limit of funds or resource skills of a technical
                        nature not being applied because of the local shortages of capability.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d120-06" facs="d120-06"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Well, we leave it to you to
                        decide.</p>
                    <p>Just now you mentioned enough time has passed, and I will explain the reason
                        for this,. As soon as we found Mr. Wang dead in his bed, we immediately
                        notified the policeman on duty, as well as Mrs. Loeb's office, and an
                        ambulance came to our hotel, and the policeman came to the spot.</p>
                    <p>That afternoon on the same day, some detectives were sent to make an
                        on-the-spot investigation. Afterwards we asked the Chief Medical Examiner's
                        Office of New York City to make an autopsy of the body in an attempt to find
                        the reason. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> corrects the interpreter
                        by saying “cause” instead of “reason.”)</p>
                    <p>The resulting autopsy failed to show the cause of death. Later, we asked them
                        to carry out a toxicological analysis. That took some time, and later the
                        Chief Medical Examiner of New York City - he got the preliminary results of
                        the toxicological analysis which was acute nicotine poisoning. So we asked
                        them to give us a written report of the conclusions of the analysis as soon
                        as possible. And that also took quite a lot of time, and we pressed them
                        quite a few times.</p>
                    <p>The next day, after we got the written report, we transmitted this to
                        Ambassador Phillips and affirmed that this was a political incident of
                        murder; we asked the U.S. side to make an investigation and unveil the plot
                        and have the culprits punished.</p>
                    <p>So some time had passed before we got the results of that, and this was acute
                        nicotine poisoning; and between the preliminary report and the written
                        report some time also passed, but we notified the police at the
                        beginning.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Oh yes, It is very
                        difficult because of the local jurisdictions, the local New York police. I
                        was aware that much time had passed before realizing they had foul play. Now
                        they must move for two purposes. One is to make every effort to find the
                        culprits. Then we must be sure as you move into the new location, be sure
                        that there is no possibility of repetition. So we have the two problems.</p>
                    <p>I have one other thing. I have learned that your ping pong team is coming. We
                        are very pleased and very honored that they are going to come. We want to be
                        very sure that their tour is made as comfortable and enjoyable for them as I
                        am sure it will be for our people to observe it. I am talking here too about
                        security. We want to be absolutely sure that as they travel, <pb n="7" xml:id="d120-07" facs="d120-07"/>there are no incidents that they are
                        not subject to incidents of any kind that would discomfort or embarrass
                        them, or us as your host. We hope to do as well for your team as you did for
                        our team when they visited your country.</p>
                    <p>To ensure this hospitality we think it would be very helpful … and we have
                        assigned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">Scali</persName>, who went to China
                        with me and with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> when
                        he was there. The President has asked him to watch over the project and to
                        give his personal attention to assure that this is a most successful
                        tour.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: The original plan was for the ping
                        pong team to leave Ottawa and arrive in the U.S. on April 10. And now the
                        plan has changed, and they will leave on April 12 because they will get some
                        rest there.</p>
                    <p>As to the members of the delegation, originally there were twenty men on the
                        ping pong team, and six correspondents and photographers, and later the team
                        was increased by two. We have already notified Mr. Steenhoven about
                        this.</p>
                    <p>As to what city the ping pong team will arrive at first, and as to their
                        itinerary, these are things that are still under discussion between us and
                        Mr. Steenhoven. The visit here will last two weeks, and then they will leave
                        for Mexico. This is one of the items in the exchange of sports between the
                        two sides agreed upon during the President's trip to China. As you do, we
                        also hope the visit will be a success.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I want to say, as I
                        told the Premier when we took newspapermen with us on our trip, these are
                        independent people as Mr. Steenhoven is and other organizations assisting.
                        We cannot control them with the same kind of precision as government
                        officials. Maybe at times they will be more difficult than we would like. If
                        there is some incident or misunderstanding that gives you a problem, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">Scali</persName> will be watching from behind
                        the scenes. But we want to make sure that nothing like this occurs. We want
                        you to alert us. Our principle is to do everything you want us to do and to
                        make the visit a success. The working out of the details sometimes is not as
                        smooth as you or we would like. With some patience we will get the job
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: When we have agreed upon the itinerary
                        with Mr. Steenhoven, we will let you know.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d120-08" facs="d120-08"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: That is fine. I just
                        want to let you know that we are pleased and will approach this with a most
                        positive attitude, as we did with some of the more troublesome details with
                        the newspapermen in China. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>
                        smiles.)</p>
                    <p>I hesitate to raise one last thing; Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be very made at me. He is in Acapulco
                        enjoying a vacation. He left me with a newspaperman who calls me every day
                        and is driving me crazy. And this is our friend, Mr. Alsop, who is so
                        anxious to go to China that he will not let me sleep. I would like to tell
                        him to go to Ottawa or write to Ottawa or something. I think he feels no one
                        understands his special problem.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Joseph Alsop?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes. (Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> smiles.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I can convey the desire of Mr. Alsop
                        to the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Anything to help my
                        sleep at night. (Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>I am pleased and happy to see the Ambassador again. I haven't had the
                        opportunity to thank you for the wonderful reception in China that was given
                        to me and my party and to tell you what a wonderful visit it was.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> We also were very pleased that your
                        visit was a comfortable and enjoyable one.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: It was wonderful.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I know Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> (looking toward Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>), your mother.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: She mentioned she met you and
                        was very pleased to do so. She thinks that we only met in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>(There was some more closing pleasantries as the Ambassador waited for his
                        car and then left.)</p>

                    <p>1. The Chinese side has noted the promise conveyed in the April 3, 1972
                        message from the U.S. side that U.S. ships and aircraft would no longer come
                        within 12 nautical miles of China's Hsi Hsa Islands. At the same time, the
                        Chinese side reiterates that the Hsi Hsa Islands are indisputably Chinese
                        territory, that the width of the Chinese territorial sea stipulated by her
                        is 12 nautical miles, and that it requires all quarters to show full respect
                        for this.</p>
                    <p>2. Regarding the second point of the April 3, 1972 message, the Chinese side
                        has the following comments:</p>
                    <p>The spirit with which the Chinese and U.S. sides have conducted relations
                        consists of frankness in the exchange of views without concealing the great
                        differences existing between them and an effort to seek common ground. The
                        Chinese side has always acted in this spirit. The U.S. message reproaching
                        against the Chinese side is unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side can be under no misapprehension concerning China's principled
                        stand on the question of Indochina. The U.S. side knows full well that the
                        Chinese side firmly supports the peoples of the three Indochina countries in
                        their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese
                        side is convinced that the Vietnamese <pb n="10" xml:id="d120-10" facs="d120-10"/>7 point proposal and the 2 points of elaboration have
                        provided a reasonable basis for a peaceful settlement, that any attempt by
                        the U.S. side to intensify the war and exert pressures can only give rise to
                        even stronger resistance by the Indochinese peoples, that the Chinese people
                        sharing weal and woe with the Indochinese peoples will certainly give them
                        strong support, and that the Chinese believe that such actions on the part
                        of the U.S. side can only exacerbate tension/and provide opportunities for
                        others to take advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these conditions one cannot but be surprised that the U.S.
                        side should express difficulty in understanding recent Chinese statements on
                        the Indochina issue. China realizes that the United States of America is in
                        a difficult position on the Indochina issue. However, the U.S. side must
                        understand that this situation was brought about entirely by the U.S.
                        itself. The concentration of U.S. naval and air forces for the wanton
                        bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the clamors about expanding
                        the war, the indefinite suspension of the Paris talks, etc. decidedly will
                        not help the U.S. gain its objective but can only make the U.S. even more
                        bogged down in an embarrassing position.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d120-11" facs="d120-11"/>
                    <p>The Chinese side wishes to call attention to the following passage in the
                        Shanghai Communique: ”… the two sides agreed that countries, regardless of
                        their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of
                        respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states,
                        non-aggression against other states, non-interference in the internal
                        affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful
                        coexistence.”</p>
                    <p>On the question of Indochina, it is the U.S. that has violated these
                        principles and harmed Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and not Vietnam,
                        Cambodia, and Laos that have harmed the U.S. If the U.S. takes its above
                        statement seriously and truly has a desire to effect a reasonable settlement
                        of the question of Indochina, then it should reexamine its own attitude.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese side reiterates that it attaches importance to the normalization
                        of Sino-U.S. relations and that it is firm in upholding its principles.</p>

                    <p>New York City</p>
                    <p>On a day when the New York Times had an 8-column, 2-line headline on the U.S.
                        bombing of the Haiphong area, I was received more warmly than on either of
                        my two previous visits—with three cups of Jasmine tea, plenty of smiles, and
                        35 minutes of very friendly small talk. This was the first time I had
                        received the tea treatment. My previous visits had been short and
                        perfunctory—opening pleasantries followed by closing pleasantries.</p>
                    <p>After the first cup of tea and about ten minutes of small talk, at a lull in
                        the conversation, I offered the note and invited her to read it if she
                        wished. She read it, put it back in the envelope, put it down on the
                        table—and poured another cup of tea and resumed the conversation with
                        uninterrupted cordiality.</p>
                    <p>The conversation covered such stirring subjects as the weather, her visit to
                        the Bronx Zoo, the pandas and their dependence on bamboo shoots, the variety
                        of cultural activity at Lincoln Center, her hometown (Shanghai), my hometown
                        (Boston) and its revolutionary past, the teaching of history in American and
                        Chinese secondary schools, pollution in the Great Lakes and the President's
                        Ottawa agreement, and so forth.</p>
                    <p>[Attachment]</p>

                    <p>The U.S. side wishes to bring up to date the negotiating record on Indochina
                        which it outlined to the Chinese side on April 12, 1972.</p>
                    <p>On April 15, 1972, the North Vietnamese informed the United States they they
                        were calling off the April 24, 1972 private meeting and made their
                        attendance at a future private meeting conditional on a resumption of the
                        public meetings on April 27, 1972.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes to emphasize the seriousness and urgency with which he
                        views this new development.</p>
                    <p>For the information of the Chinese side, the United States side is proposing
                        to the North Vietnamese the following compromise: The United States is
                        prepared to state that it will agree to resumption of the plenary sessions
                        on April 27, 1972 if the North Vietnamese attend the private meeting agreed
                        upon for April 24, 1972. The United States would be willing to announce
                        publicly its agreement to a plenary session on April 27, 1972 as soon as the
                        North Vietnamese indicate that they will attend the private meeting on April
                        24, 1972.</p>
                    <p>The cavalier behavior of the North Vietnamese whereby for the third time they
                        have cancelled an agreed upon private meeting after planning arrangements
                        have been completed, is inconsistent with the dignity of the U.S. This has
                        forced the President to take certain limited retaliatory measures. A
                        continuation of the North Vietnamese effort to impose a military solution on
                        the U.S. must have very serious consequences.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d121-03" facs="d121-03"/>
                    <p>The President wants to reiterate that his fundamental objective remains a
                        rapid end to the war on a basis just for both sides. His strong preference
                        is for a negotiated solution and it is not by his choice that a resurgence
                        of the conflict takes place.</p>

                    <p>Miss Shih apologized for the inconvenience of the hour, once when I arrived
                        and a second time as I left, and the Ambassador did so as well upon greeting
                        me. Neither offered any explanation and I did not ask.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> welcomed me
                        cordially upstairs, and we sat down for the first of three cups of jasmine
                        tea. Miss Shih promised me green tea next time. After an exchange of other
                        pleasantries, the Ambassador said he had a message for me to deliver to Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He explained that it
                        concerned an intrusion by a U.S. military aircraft over Hainan on April 16,
                        that the details were in the note, and that besides the note he had no other
                        message to convey. He handed over the note [attached] and I said I would
                        deliver it to my Government.</p>
                    <p>He asked a few questions about the mechanics of my getting to New York,
                        whether I had a place to stay, and how I would be getting back. All of this
                        seemed a way of fishing around for when I would be conveying their message
                        back to Washington. Therefore, when I indicated I would be returning in the
                        morning. I also mentioned that I would nevertheless be able to convey the
                        message to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>We then indulged in very friendly small talk for the remainder of the
                        meeting, over the second and third cups of tea. The Ambassador hoped the tea
                        wasn't so strong that it prevented me from sleeping. I said that <pb n="2" xml:id="d122-02" facs="d122-02"/>at that hour I probably would have no
                        trouble getting to sleep. They laughed.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked about my background, and then about the study of
                        government and international relations at Harvard. He asked if I knew of any
                        good books on world history in the postwar period. I said I was not aware of
                        many, partly because not many scholars these days attempt so ambitious a
                        project, but I mentioned Fontaine's History of the Cold War (which I had not
                        read) and explained who Fontaine was. He said he had heard of a book by
                        Hart. I thought he was referring to Liddell-Hart's History of the Second
                        World War. The Ambassador said yes, that's the one. I hadn't read that one
                        either, but I explained who Liddell-Hart was. The Ambassador mentioned
                        Toynbee, and we talked about historians and philosophers I had studied under
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (Thucydides,
                        Machiavelli, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Spengler, Toynbee, etc.) The
                        Ambassador asked if I had read Lenin's Imperialism - The Highest Stage of
                        Capitalism I said yes. He said he had found it a “useful analysis” of
                        historical development. I did not comment.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador pointed out that the history of China is usually divided into
                        the pre-modern and modern periods at around the 1850's, because that was the
                        beginning of the imperialist depredations. He said he realized that American
                        history didn't really have a pre-modern period.</p>
                    <p>Miss Shih then mentioned to the Ambassador that I was from Boston. The
                        Ambassador said he had heard of the Boston Tea Party, and I explained the
                        circumstances of that. It couldn't have been Chinese tea that they threw
                        overboard, I added, because Chinese tea is too good to throw out. The
                        Ambassador laughed. Whether it was Chinese or Indian tea, he said, it was
                        British imperialism they were protesting against. I said yes, but in any
                        case Chinese tea was too good to dump overboard.</p>
                    <p>We finished a few more cups of it, chatted about the ping-pong team tour (I
                        made the mistake of asking how the matches had come out) and its call on the
                        President, and other great events. We shook hands, and I was escorted
                        downstairs and to the door by Miss Shih.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d122-03" facs="d122-03"/>
                    <p>[Attachment]</p>
                    <p>At 0406 hours, April 16, 1972 (Peking time), one U.S. military aircraft
                        intruded into the airspace west of Changkan County, Hainan Island,
                        Kwangtung, China (point of intrusion: 108°30' E. 19°33' N.), penetrating up
                        to ten kilometers into China. The aircraft was very obviously one of the
                        U.S. planes that bombed Haiphong on the same day. The Chinese Government
                        lodges a protest with the U.S. side against this intrusion, and demands that
                        the U.S. side prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.</p>

                        left personally with the President when they saw him earlier this week
                        concerning their China trip:</p>

                    <p>— Tab E - a short piece by Senator <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>, apparently given to Roscoe Drummond</p>
                    <p>There is nothing in these materials that is particularly sensitive or
                        startling. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">John Holdridge</persName> is staffing
                        this package for the President, but you may wish to leaf through it in
                        advance.</p>
                    <p>A few quick impressions from a fast reading:</p>
                    <p>— Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s report, which is
                        a genuine effort to be thoughtful, basically confirms the Senator's prior
                        perspective of China, as well as his great concern over our Indochina policy
                        and its possible impact on U.S./<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>— Senator <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>'s report is very thin
                        gruel. One interesting fact is Chou receptivity to the Senator's inquiry on
                        Senator <pb n="2" xml:id="d123-02" facs="d123-02"/> Magnuson and some
                        members of the Commerce Committee visiting China to discuss trade and
                        commerce. Also <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s generally
                        positive attitude on exchanges in general.</p>
                    <p>— The reception for the Senators and their party was very cordial and very
                        efficient. This was reconfirmed to me by a debriefing of the trip that I got
                        from Ken Calloway, our contact in State who was personally tremendously
                        impressed by <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s China.</p>
                    <p>— The conversations with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName> did not reach great
                        philosophic heights. The bulk of the time was spent on Indochina, with the
                        Chinese repeating familiar positions and the Senators displaying their own
                        divergent views.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> specifically ruled out
                        discussions on Taiwan, on the grounds of his confidential exchanges with the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>— I don't see anything in the attached that bears out <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s emphasis in the Senate yesterday
                        that no further progress in U.S./<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        relations is possible until Indochina is settled. The current situation
                        since the President's speech may be a new factor, but in the context of the
                        Senator's discussions in China in April, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> line seems to be similar to the one we have always heard,
                        i.e. that Indochina is the “most urgent” issue for reducing tensions in the
                        Far East.</p>

                    <p>April 19, 1972</p>
                    <p>The Vice-Minister opened by saying that contacts between the two peoples has
                        increased since President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                        visit. American businessmen (30) will be attending Canton Trade Fair and the
                        pandas have arrived in Washington and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has received the Chinese ping pong team and
                        understands that they were well received in U.S. cities. The Vice-Minister
                        is very glad to see these visits occurring and feels a frank exchange of
                        views despite differences in two systems is most beneficial. Both leaders
                            (<persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>) desire to exchange views on Asia and the world as
                        well as visit various Chinese cities. The Vice-Minister welcomes the
                        opportunity to have a frank discussion of views. 20 years of
                        non-communication has brought many changes in the world that need
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - We have been apart too
                        long - China cannot be ignored - China has many problems and the sooner we
                        arrive at communication between the two countries the better both countries
                        will be. Hope the Chinese understand the system of Democratic majority in

                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Following President's visit
                        there was almost a miracle. There has existed for 22 years a feeling among
                        the American people for better relations with China, though politicians of
                        both parties were not fully aware of the peoples' desire - the high regard
                        for both peoples was there all the time. Both parties endorse President's
                        visit and visit of the two leaders we would like to say that we laid the
                        groundwork for other visits and exchanges, i.e., House Members, governors,
                        mayors, cultural and athletic. Meetings such as this must not be squandered
                        with small talk but must be meaningful and frank discussions.</p>

                        exist but believe differences need not obstruct our coming together. We

                        parties, this is natural, we respect your differences between parties—how

                        can give views of their two parties. In our party we cannot say we agree on
                        specific issues but we are all in agreement on direction.
                            <persName>Frank</persName> exchange of views is not to cover up but to
                        discuss differences openly - debate of differences will be helpful - natural
                        to have differences. I understand President has just indicated a desire to
                        come to China in the spring - you are lucky because you are seeing China in
                        the spring before your President.</p>

                        where they now exist. Due in part to vacuum created after great war, U.S.
                        overextended, too far, too wide, too thinly. Bring about gradual withdrawal,
                        facing up to recognition that U.S. has limited number of people and limited
                        resources. Purpose is to make possible more people in all parts of the world
                        to be dependent on themselves and less on others. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to take in all the world.
                        (Mentioned <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.) It means in Asia that the
                        U.S. is basically a Pacific power and not an Asian power - our interest is
                        off the mainland of Asia, not in Asia. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine cannot be put in action overnight you must
                        recognize we are facing up to political realities and economic realities ot
                        today. Keep in mind we have much to learn compared to China - we are still
                        in swaddling clothes - you have had much time, you have made great
                        contributions. We will develop policies in accord with today, not yesterday.

                        with <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> that what is
                        contemplated but not active is an extension. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and I disagree with numbers of withdrawal in
                        Europe. Desire never again to be involved in Asia. Our wish to avoid through
                        American power or presence so that Asian countries will not call upon us to
                        get involved. American public will more quickly approve gradual withdrawal.
                        We speak of trends of withdrawal—your view is our commitment should be
                        complete. Is that a fair statement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Believe exchange
                        should be frank - we would like to be frank. I would like to enlarge my
                        comments on the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. It is
                        nearly 27 years since end of World War II and as for our view since 2nd
                        World War U.S. has been reaching its hands out too far. And in those 27
                        years both Administrations in America have put forth various doctrines to
                        cope with these situations. Preceding from personal experience - shortly
                        after World War II I met Dulles and at that time it was the Truman Doctrine
                        during Korean War and then Eisenhower put forth his doctrine and then in the
                        60's the <persName>Kennedy</persName> Administration also had a strategy to
                        go any place to meet any challenge. After that <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        and during that Administration there was an expansion of war in Viet-Nam.
                        This question is of great concern to China. Then came <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration. I would also like to
                        say frankly our attitude has been consistent in listening to their words but
                        watching their deeds. Would not want to dwell on past matters—although no
                        opportunity to have friendly exchanges—many times we met as enemies. For
                        instance, Korea - 1st Geneva Conference - 2nd Geneva Conference—during “54”
                        Geneva Conference American representative refused to shake hands with
                        Premier. While this belongs in the past, it is in our memory. From what the
                        two Senators just said you have common feeling that world has changed <pb n="7" xml:id="d123-07" facs="d123-07"/>and old policies cannot meet
                        these changes. Should be said that we have noted and attached great
                        importance that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has courage to
                        face the fact that old policies cannot meet today's problems. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also expressed desire to improve
                        relations with China. This admittance of a changed world reflects desire to
                        have better relations with China and have found common points in this sense.
                        As for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, Scott asked
                        whether we wished speedy and complete withdrawal from this area - of course,
                        that is true - one point of difference between two Senators - once military
                        presence is withdrawn from area that area becomes a vacuum—not so. For
                        instance China - I have discussed with Harriman before in Geneva - he took
                        part in Yalta Conference—what we are having now is not diplomatic but
                        friendly—China partly in sphere of influence of U.S. and partly in sphere of
                        influence of U.S.S.R. but more closely to U.S. But later on could also be
                        said the U.S. had to loosen hold on China and what was the result - we both
                        can see China did not become a vacuum. There are two super-powers—U.S. and
                        Russia—China belongs to neither. That is one example and therefore we do not
                        agree to the idea that once American presence is withdrawn that area becomes
                        a vacuum - that when one super-power leaves the other one must enter. Our
                        philosophies different, therefore there is no need to debate at great
                        length. We also take analysis when we discuss <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. Another question not ready to debate at
                        great length, American involvement in Viet-Nam. Should be ended and we see
                        unfortunately that this has not happened - am not prepared to debate at
                        length - to ease tensions in Far East basic issue is Viet-Nam and the rest
                        of Indo-China. Also in Shanghai Communique crucial question is Taiwan that
                        obstructs normal relationship but Viet-Nam is still overriding and without
                        settlement there can be no normalization of relationship. We believe there
                        has been change since <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> took
                        office - big change. It is not to say that we agree that the present way the
                        U.S. is handling Viet-Nam government is the way to bring results - I am not
                        prepared to deal at great length because of differences between two
                        Senators. As for aspect of Nixon Doctrine fixing first objective and then
                        gradual approach to that objective - we cannot say there is not merit to
                        that approach. Question <pb n="8" xml:id="d123-08" facs="d123-08"/>of Taiwan
                        not settled - only found some common points of view on this issue - and if
                        on basis of these common points able to reach solution we Chinese are
                        patient and able to wait a while. General view of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is analytical, not one
                        monolithic piece.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Don't intend to engage in
                        debate or make public statement here - will confine to my own country. _You
                        mentioned many doctrines - Truman Doctrine separate from Eisenhower
                        Doctrine—any blame both parties responsible. During Truman became involved
                        in Viet-Nam before “54” Accord. Continued under Eisenhower - maintained
                        military advisor group in Viet-Nam. Continued under
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> and 16,000 troops at time of assassination
                        - still advisors. <persName>Kennedy</persName> statement, “Be prepared to
                        meet any challenge at any time at any place” was spoken in defense of U.S.
                        and not foreign adventures. Under <persName>Johnson</persName> increased to
                        548,000 in Viet-Nam. Under <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        reduced to 85,000 today. As we all know build-up in air and sea power
                        because of increased activity. Deed of reduction fits into desires of
                        President.</p>

                        withdraw completely from this area - no actual interest in Asian mainland -
                        must maintain peace in Pacific - not alone but hopefully with China and
                        Japan - all have common responsibility. I dislike the word “super-power” -
                        any sovereign nation is a power - completely surprised by your reference to

                        for views although we differ, appreciate opportunity to exchange views. This
                        is our first meeting and we do not know each other very well. Just as
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> said, not engage in small
                        talk but discuss major issues - that is spirit of discussions - have great
                        respect for both Senators and will not try and impose our views on you or
                        your views on us. Am surprised by some of your views but glad to have them.
                        Will meet again tomorrow same time.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Discussion yesterday
                        very useful - I propose we proceed as follows - like to ask two Senators to
                        give views on international situation - particularly Viet-Nam, Korea and
                        Taiwan. This is frank discussion of views and will reassure we will not take
                        advantage of discussions and not use anything said for propaganda
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Agree - place to express
                        our views is at home.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Repeats request as to <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> view as to what is the right attitude to

                        men, concern for <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s and our intention to
                        withdraw all forces if peace can be had at the table.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Opposed to war there - my
                        belief that war will not end on the battlefield but through talks at Paris.
                        The sooner the better. I desire neutralization of all of Indo-China with
                        observance of both Geneva Accords and some sort of external guarantee of
                        future peace - we have no business in that part of the world and we ought to
                        get out.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Since neutralization
                        is common view of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, does
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> have any further view on
                        Laos and Cambodia?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Enlarge talks at Paris -
                        Sihanouk should represent his country and King Sri Savang Vatthana to
                        represent Laos.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - No personal objection to
                        enlargement of talks at Paris - Laos and Cambodia should have representation
                        from competing groups so that all will be bound.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - As to international
                        guarantees, we had experience with 1954 agreement what could be more solemn
                        - U.S. made a statement it would not disturb the agreement, U.S. later took
                        action. It is because of that we are still studying that question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - U.S. was not a
                        signatory.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Of course that could
                        involve historical facts I must respectfully disagree with you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Most respectfully but what
                        is China's attitude on neutralization?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Concept very general
                        with different meaning we have not opposed concept of neutrality. You may
                        have noticed our two positions (1) all forces should be withdrawn - (2) all
                        questions should be settled within countries by their own peoples and should
                        be free to choose their own system. As to presence in three countries,
                        exclude big country interference and countries following big countries and
                        before this matter is settled is premature to discuss neutralization. And if
                        you ask our position no matter the “54” Accord or “62” Accords, our position
                        has been consistent adherence to these agreements. And it will continue -
                        what the Chinese say counts and they abide by agreements which they
                        sign.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Renews question of peace in
                        Korea - leading steps by U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> toward
                        substitution of peace agreement for armistice, thus facilitating withdrawal
                        of U.S. forces.</p>
                    <p>Chiao Kuan-liua - Reviews history including Chinese volunteers vs. U.S.
                        forces. If situation in Korea were to develop into situation present in
                        Europe then China need not have withdrawn forces. But we withdrew
                        voluntarily in 1958 but your troops have remained until <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> took office and withdrew some troops.
                        Here opinions of our two sides disagree - you regard U.S. presence as
                        preserving peace. We believe the presence obstructs chances of peace and
                        increases tension - therefore we believe that from whatever point you look
                        at it the U.S. should withdraw from Korea, as essential to a peace treaty
                        and the coming together of North and South Korea and the reunification of
                        that country. We have noted <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                            Nixon</persName> statements as to gradual reduction of troops - all have
                        noted in Sino-U.S. Communique - U.S. expressed hope that contacts between
                        two sides should be increased and U.S. has encouraged this. To put it in a
                        nutshell - the withdrawal of that military presence is the one issue we
                        agree upon - nations of the East have long history of unification - if
                        objective is to allow states to exist for long period in state of division
                        we believe that is not possible-2 Chinas - 2 Koreas - 2 Viet-Nams. Erroneous
                        and impossible to <pb n="4" xml:id="d124-04" facs="d124-04"/>continue such a
                        policy. How can a few decades of division affect the long history of
                        unification? If these countries can be left to themselves without foreign
                        intervention, they will effect peaceful unification of their countries - if
                        we thought no hope we would not have advocated peaceful solutions within the
                        countries without foreign intervention.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - No disagreement with your
                        analysis - these countries will have to decide own destinies without outside
                        interference, near or far.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Speaks of very quick reversal
                        of U.S. policy and U.S. sentiment - reversing decade of policy in Viet-Nam -
                        2 decades in Korea and as to China - with only very small percentage of
                        dissension - U.S. opinion. This change is too great not to be well
                        understood.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Question of Korea,
                        Viet-Nam and China are different from East and West Germany. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> may be right that East &amp; West
                        Germany may take longer to settle very happy to note that majority in both
                        U.S. parties have expressed support of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s policies and to note also the developments which
                        have followed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> attitude toward Japan has surprised me - why do you place
                        so much emphasis on Japan as a hindrance to better relations in the Pacific
                        and why you give Japan such emphasis in view of the fact that Japan has
                        become close to greatest trading nation and is now less militarily oriented
                        than in past years?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - First, you are a
                        strong country far from Japan. We are its close neighbor. Japan has in the
                        past committed aggression against both of us, but deeper and greater against
                        us. Impossible for this not to influence us. But we have never taken
                        attitude of revenge against country or people of Japan. About 1955 Japan
                        held an exhibition in Peking. In front of the hall they ran up the flag of
                        Japan. Our officials thought that was normal but popular reaction was very
                        strong they were still sensitive to Japanese aggression since 1890 in spite
                        of this our government worked to persuade our people to differentiate
                        between Japanese people and their government.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d124-05" facs="d124-05"/>
                    <p>Japanese people most apologetic about Japanese aggression - we stress no need
                        for this. In the future we look forward to equality in all our relations -
                        why then do we have concern - you have great influence over Japan and Japan
                        is embarking on a great course of war preparation (<persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> notes underlined my notes say
                        military). Lessons to be drawn from World Wars I &amp; II if revenge is
                        followed both countries will suffer and could be counter-productive and
                        offensive to people. We believe present Japanese government policy is not
                        defense but expansion and aggression - not happy to point out that in the
                        joint communique between <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Japan stated that they
                        regarded Taiwan closely related to the defense of Japan (Nov.1969). Obvious
                        that Japan's view is to control Taiwan, Korea and other Asia nations. Our
                        view is a lesson of history that economic outward expansion inevitably leads
                        to military outward expansion during World War II the spearhead was directed
                        first against China and when strong enough against the U.S. We remember that
                        lesson and we believe we should be vigilant.</p>

                        - have met Japanese leaders in all four parties and have found reluctance to
                        increase military budget much beyond 1% of their <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Surely Japan is aware how
                        much stronger China is today - and non-aggressive.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao Kuan-Hua</persName> - Reason in that
                        argument - but it must not be forgotten that when Japan attacked U.S. you
                        were strong - like to add that although no relations with present government
                        exist, volume of trade and meetings with Japanese people is quite great.
                        Bulk of China visitors are Japanese - have been happy to have this exchange.
                        Propose we break off here.</p>

                    <p>Premier - Do not want to overtire you. Let's set limit for 10:30 p.m. and
                        resume later if we do not finish. What way could tension in Far East be
                        reduced?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Settlement of war in
                        Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>Premier - War in Indo-China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Correct way to put it -
                        other steps in due time will be taken - question of Taiwan for China to
                        settle. Japan - apprehension understandable - but maybe not as bad. Korea -
                        U.S. not Asian power but Pacific power - Pacific power in Pacific, not on
                        mainland. Equality of all nations and all peoples in the area. Viet-Nam -
                        neutralization. Korea - reunification. Japan-U.S. &amp; <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> - getting together to guarantee
                        neutralization of Indo-China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - With belief that solution
                        will be pacific and may take a while - the reunification of China without
                        U.S. presence, including Taiwan, can occur after the end of Viet-Nam
                        conflict both <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and I want
                        end. It should be brought to end immediately. Question of POW is of
                        emotional concern to Americans but must Americans want U.S. out totally,
                        air, ground and sea. Should occur at the peace table under mutual
                        conditions. People of Viet-Nam should choose freely their government - my
                        view cannot be resolved without settling <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>
                        question. U.S. people agreed to total withdrawal but not without conditions.
                        In Korea - we have withdrawn 1/3 of our forces - total withdrawal should be
                        accomplished with an armistice. Realize your disillusionment with Geneva
                        Accord - maybe a new accord with new nations and those who did not sign
                        before - U.S. has always looked west with depth of concern that at times has
                        been low temperature, but always concerned - Europe is like peaks and
                        valleys - sometimes we have been involved - sometimes not. In the west we
                        are riding a wave toward agreement - the finest time that I have seen in my
                        71 years but we must do it together.</p>

                    <p>Premier - It seems then that both Senators agree that to relax tensions the
                        primary question is Viet-Nam. To be more precise Indo-China and the
                        withdrawal of foreign troops. Do you think the escalation by bombing North
                        Viet-Nam can bring this about?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - I made a statement in
                        Honolulu that it would prolong the war - both sides should stop acting like
                        little boys with chips on shoulders and sit down at Paris table (repeats
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> secret talks.) It
                        appears to me we place too much emphasis on pride - we have lost in this war
                        - through April 1st a total of 302,802 wounded - 45,000 dead, 10,123 dead
                        from non-combat—total 55,802 dead, 358,622 total casualties. It includes
                        147,631 South Vietnamese dead and Allied forces 4,876 dead and the other
                        side 805,395 casualties—this war in some fashion must be brought to an end -
                        not on battlefield - must be by negotiation. Nobody wins a war anymore - I
                        think the talks should be expanded to include Laos and Cambodia - I do not
                        believe bombing is the way to shorten it but to lengthen it. As Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> has pointed out the
                        stumbling block is the <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss> question.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> did make a proposal
                        some months ago that if agreement could be reached for a time certain if all
                            <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s were released, he would be willing
                        to consider a proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Radio Hanoi reports that
                        renewed bombing has unified North Viet-Nam. It has also in my view unified
                        America - I support the President's position. What other course is open to
                        the U.S. pending withdrawal of our remaining forces? Expand talks - there is
                        open invasion (from North) now. First time since Sparta moved against Athens
                        that a country has moved its entire forces out of its country to invade
                        another. The bombing has now been temporarily suspended but if I were Hanoi
                        I would offer to release all <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s - this
                        would have vast effect on public opinion and the President would be aware of
                        it. Do not agree that bombing prolongs war - we may be entering last
                        phase.</p>
                    <p>(<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> asks for list of <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> &amp; <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - U.S. thinks may be as high as
                        1,600, but Hanoi admits to 400 to 500.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Sorry to interrupt but heard from unofficial sources that President
                        has temporarily suspended bombing but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> in testimony said it was not correct.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> &amp; <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Not aware of such testimony.</p>
                    <p>Premier - I heard that in the past the Senate has expressed opinion that a
                        final date for withdrawal could be reached if all <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s were released on final date.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Passed Senate twice - a
                        date certain depending upon release of prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Premier - By American Armed Forces - do you include Air Force and Navy?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Yes - all in Viet-Nam. No
                        forces in Laos or Cambodia except advisors.</p>
                    <p>Premier - I have heard that Sen. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> had urged the talks in Paris be expanded to
                        include Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Yes, plus King Sri Savang
                        of Laos.</p>
                    <p>Premier - As far as betrayal by <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>
                        government, we regard him as not the true representative, whereas you deal
                        with him as the government. Here we can only differ - we feel that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> speaks not only for persons
                        outside Cambodia but for the large forces in Cambodia. Originally, mostly
                        peasants but now large groups of city dwellers are leaving to support
                        national forces of liberation in the country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - About half of Cambodia now
                        so occupied - but in Laos, where U.S. forces left North Viet-Nam ignored
                        “62” agreement and increased from 15,000 to 70,000 - am I correct?</p>
                    <p>Premier - Of course,you speak from your information but I would like to call
                        your attention to the facts: China was a signatory to the “62” agreement -
                        at the time the issue was never solved that within the area of the Pathet
                        Lao there was a group of bandit meos who stubbornly and obstinately refused
                        to move from the area assisted by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
                        then and now, with Thai troops being furnished and supported by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was not involved at time of “62” agreement <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> came later after N. Viet-Nam did not live
                        up to agreement to withdraw troops.</p>

                    <p>Premier - This causes us to go back to agreements of 1954 we can go into that
                        later - did <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> meddle in affair to install

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - No, as far as I can
                        determine, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had no part.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - If they had anything to do
                        with it, Sen. Symington would have unearthed it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - When <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> came into office he reduced forces in
                        Viet-Nam from 549,000 to 85,000 and is continuing. I expect him to continue
                        down to 69,000 May 1st— he will make another announcement prior to May 1st.
                        It is my belief, it is his intention to announce further troop withdrawals -
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has reversed trend from in
                        to out.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Shall we go? I affirm one point - we have noticed that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has indeed made these withdrawals,
                        only that in itself is not enough. Essential issue we must end the war - we
                        must find a way out. We three are in charge of the talks - we are pledged
                        not to interfere in the sovereignty of these countries. We can, of course,
                        give our suggestions to them. The same that the two Senators can offer
                        advice but final action is up to the government. We truly are waiting.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - For what?</p>
                    <p>Premier - For the end of the war in Viet-Nam.</p>

                    <p>Premier - I hear you preferred “Red Detachment of Women” to “White-Haired
                        Girl.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - I have seen only
                        “White-Haired Girl”. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> and I
                        liked it and hope that the Premier will send the Shanghai bailet to the U.S.
                        (referring to Premier's suggestion at his dinner that he might send them if
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> liked them.)</p>
                    <p>Premier - We have heard today from Paris that the two House leaders will
                        visit China June 26th after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> returns from Moscow.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Recognizing your policy of
                        non-intervention in internal affairs of other nations, but is any agreement
                        possible with Hanoi for release of <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s and
                            <gloss target="#t_MIA1">MIA</gloss>s on same day of final U.S.
                        withdrawal with no other conditions or quibbles?</p>
                    <p>Premier - I have already said we cannot say anything on behalf of third party
                        (cites 4th clause 2nd part of Shanghai Communique) - cannot give definite
                        reply - can explain bit on two points of Madame Binh 7-point proposal. (1)
                        U.S. set final date for complete withdrawal all U.S. forces from Indo-China
                        and as gradually withdrawn, gradual release of all <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s - at final day of withdrawal, all <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s released. (2) U.S. withdraw support of <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> government and establishment of a
                        government of national concord. If any U.S. forces remain, war will continue
                        these conditions are firm and we support them. We are friends of the
                        Indo-Chinese people—we continue to assist them - we do not interfere - we
                        offer advice. On April 16th I said to Charge d'Affaires of Provisional
                        government of South Viet-Nam (Viet Cong) that bombing should cease and Paris
                        talks should resume - they and North Viet-Nam also suggested talks resume on
                        April 27th even if bombing not stopped - was rejected by U.S. We are most
                        disappointed by turn of events. We can only continue to support North
                        Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Do you think it would help
                        to enlarge talks to include Laos and Cambodia?</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d126-02" facs="d126-02"/>
                    <p>Premier - Time is not now - Viet-Nam is not resolved - how can we expand
                        talks? Britain has written Russia to expand Geneva Conference - Russia has
                        not replied - I think you know why we are signatories, too.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Premier has said what could
                        be more fair than that the bombings cease. I would suggest the invasion also
                        stop, that would be fair - then a cease-fire could result.</p>
                    <p>Premier - What do you mean by invasion?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Presence in South Viet-Nam of
                        almost all armed forces of North Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Ask if in your opinion invasion from air is not invasion? Would it
                        by your definition not be an invasion to shell from sea? Only shelling by
                        land to sea by your definition our opinion the invasion began with 1964
                        incident - deem all the various bombings to be invasion and aggression -
                        invasion of U.S. troops in Cambodia also aggression. As for 9th route battle
                        last year, that was a more massive intrusion. If the question is to be
                        solved - stop all war in Indo-China. If we are not to discuss responsibility
                        and just ending the war, then we could go less into history and more into
                        what can be done (reverts to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and
                        also to 2 Geneva Accords) - not a single Chinese soldier in North Viet-Nam -
                        not a single base in North Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - If we differ on terminology,
                        let us call both of them invasions then, but let us talk about cease-fire
                        and stop killing—what is wrong with that?</p>
                    <p>Premier - The question of cease-fire is a complicated one and brings us back
                        to negotiations. When we discuss negotiations we discuss assistance to the
                        Thieu government - and if that continues the war will not end. The U.S.
                        turndown of peace talks on April 27th was very disappointing - the war will
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - I was disappointed by U.S.
                        reaction - I think talks should resume.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d126-03" facs="d126-03"/>
                    <p>Premier - So we shall wait and see because this is already the 22nd. You may
                        have noticed that only after our meeting of April 16th, we published an
                        editorial on April 18th and have said nothing else since.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - We are aware of your
                        restraint in that regard. What does Premier think of chances of
                        neutralization of all Indo-China?</p>
                    <p>Premier - Madame Binh has included this point in 7-point proposal and we
                        support it. Even after U.S. massive bombardment we did not respond with
                        soldiers as we did in Korea - not even in Cambodia, even though a part of
                        their government is in Cambodia and a part in Peking Sihanouk has issued
                        more than 30 appeals to his compatriots - although some of his views are not
                        the same as ours, we do not change one word of his statements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Are there any ways by
                        which our two countries could bring about a peace settlement in Korea?</p>
                    <p>Premier - The relations here between our two countries are different from
                        other issues. That is, during 1954 conference a meeting was convened to find
                        a settlement - our efforts failed there - that was Dulles policy. During
                        1958 we withdrew our volunteers from Korea - at present the two sides meet
                        once a week at the 38th parallel - in the north. The North Korean
                        representative is principal but in the south the U.S. is principal and South
                        Korean deputy - to bring about relaxation of tension Premier Kim Il Sung has
                        proposed peace steps, beginning with Red Cross help in bringing about
                        reunion of families.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Advances hope for
                        journalistic exchanges (ASNE letter) cultural, athletic, political,
                        scientific, and medical. Members of Congress generally after political
                        conventions - all on a reciprocal basis to be much more meaningful.</p>
                    <p>Premier - This also covered in Shanghai Communique. Cites effective contacts
                        between Embassies in Paris - U.S. would send important members of
                        government, when necessary, for important discussions - after visit of
                        Senate and House leaders <pb n="4" xml:id="d126-04" facs="d126-04"/>the
                        Congressmen of both houses will be able to come - should both parties come
                        together or separately - we feel they should come together since this is an
                        election year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - I fully agree and we are
                        amazed at your understanding of the psychology of American politicians in an
                        election year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - I agree - I would like to
                        come alone sometime and spend more time.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Next year, yes, and Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>, too.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Yes, Mr. Premier, after we
                        have shown our own discretion in the way we handle this visit, of course
                        with 535 members, not all will be wise.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Of course not - one does not expect any overwhelming agreement even
                        within a political party, or within the Communist Party, or for that matter,
                        even within so-called Socialist Parties—we liked <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s Kansas speech - he put forward some new ideas, as
                        did Prime Minister Heath in his latest speech - we do not fully agree with
                        either speaker in describing China as a great power - we can potentially,
                        with proper use of our resources, become a strong country but we do not want
                        to become a super-power or exert hegemony over another region, nor should
                        any other power.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - I agree - would hope a
                        degree of mutuality to work toward betterment of mankind. Is a nuisance to
                        be a superpower.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - And elements of guilt, I'm
                        afraid.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Good if all had that awareness.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Cites conversation with Alf
                        Landon. “<persName>Hugh</persName>, now you're on the right track.”</p>
                    <p>Premier - As for exchanges in the scientific field, they are now beginning.
                        Also sports now beginning and cultural field such as your Philadelphia
                        Orchestra or Pittsburg Symphony. As <pb n="5" xml:id="d126-05" facs="d126-05"/>to journalists, somewhat more difficult - we are
                        considering establishment of journalists abroad - perhaps they should: come
                        by name and not agency - and they need not be sympathetic to us, if not that
                        is good, too. As to ASNE, which you discussed, Chou Pei-yuan will look at
                        the correspondence which I have not seen and it would be good to have them.

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Of mutual interest to both
                        our countries is Japan. The 1969 Nixon-Sato communique does refer to Taiwan
                        as “of interest” to Japan, but that was '69. Our country not interested in
                        any expanded Japan or a return to the old Japan. Would you discuss your
                        relations with Japan and your views regarding the future of the three
                        countries in the Pacific area?</p>
                    <p>Premier - Of course we must look at changes within a country. It was after
                        “69” communique and drawing up of 4th defensive plan for Japan we saw
                        military expansion to keep pace with economic expansion. Since liberation,
                        contacts between our two peoples has never ceased - we also see that it
                        would not be easy to lead Japanese people on road to militarism, since first
                        victims would be Japanese people. So we are pointing out the dangers at the
                        very beginning. Many facts and public opinion can show this trend - many
                        films advocating revival of militarism and in suicide of Okiro.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - He belonged to a tiny
                        group.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Yes, but he could shake the country for a time. We see a reversion
                        to concept of Emperor as supreme power when we point this out to our
                        Japanese friends they agree-not only members of opposition but also of
                        ruling party. Does this obstruct us from improving relations no difficulty
                        on our side—Japan the problem—Japan government and Taiwan government are too
                        close.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - But Shanghai Communique
                        recognized only one China.</p>
                    <p>Premier - That's precisely it - Japan government felt passed over - perhaps
                        your visit, too, “passed over Japan” (a pun relating to our flying across
                        Okinawa). <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s Cabinet about to be
                        reshuffled and we hope for more open-minded views. If U.S. and China can
                        improve relations, why not China and Japan? On basis of 5 principles of
                        peaceful co-existence.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Relates visit of <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName>-Muskie delegation to Japan in January
                        1970 - Japanese fears that China and U.S. will have less trouble improving
                        relations than will Japan and China. A sentiment found in all four
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Seems to me that perhaps because of their previous aggressions
                        against China over half a century they lack self-confidence. During past 22
                        years major visitors to China have been Japanese - greatest amount of trade
                        is with Japanese - all three parties of opposition have visited China and
                        have urged restoration of diplomatic relations. So many former Prime
                        Ministers and Foreign Ministers have come that I joke with them, “You come
                        only after you are out of office. Why didn't you have the courage to come
                        earlier?” There is Foreign Minister of “another country” that is most
                        opposed to improved relations between Japan and China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - A neighbor?</p>
                    <p>Premier - A neighbor who has placed a million men along our borders -
                        frontiers and territory are historical matters but historical matters that
                        must be solved - that is why when <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> came here in 1969 we signed a statement that these
                        problems should not be allowed to increase tensions. In spite of unequal and
                        imposed treaties on China, we assert no territorial claims because at times
                        of treaties neither Russian nor Chinese people were in control of their
                        governments. We said we could go to old maps to solve disputes in spirit of
                        mutual negotiations and mutual understandings. Our other border questions
                        have all been settled on that basis Burma, Mongolia and others - so we
                        propose conclusion of a provisional agreement conducive to settlement of the
                        border question - three points—(1) maintain status quo of border; (2) avoid
                        armed <pb n="7" xml:id="d126-07" facs="d126-07"/>conflict, and (3) disengage
                        military forces in disputed areas. Then negotiations could proceed on Vice
                        Ministerial level at Peking. They have met and are continuing but still
                        agreements on provisional agreement have not yet been made - and at same
                        time Soviet is putting 8 divisions (300,000 men) along borders of Mongolia -
                        what threat do we pose to Mongolia? At <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName> posed the question - Malek
                        wouldn't answer, so the Mongolian delegate felt compelled to state that
                        troops were there under a treaty - but we can wait. We waited through 16
                        years of negotiations with you until President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> came here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Sen. Magnuson asked us to
                        raise question regarding trade. Many persons interested in trade and would
                        like Premier's reaction.</p>
                    <p>Premier - We have already invited 30 U.S. businessmen and we will await
                        results of these visits.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Mentioned Magnuson and
                        Inouye - can they visit China?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Also Cotton and Pearson.</p>
                    <p>Premier - If friends from Senate Commerce Committee would like to come, will
                        you draw up a joint list when you get back so that we can consider their
                        request - both for economic and comprehensive discussion. You could contact
                        our Institute of Foreign Affairs or the Embassy in Paris. I am interested in
                        what both of you have told us of them - would like to turn now to Cambodia.
                        Since head of State in Cambodia is in Korea (<persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>) I regret that it is not advisable for you
                            (<persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>) to meet with the Prime
                        Minister of Cambodia in the absence of the head of State. They believe
                            (<persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>) that coup by Lan Nol
                        was staged with foreign support believe present war against Lan Nol is a
                        just war and that foreign forces that aid Lan Nol are committing
                        aggression—U.S.-Viet-Nam-Thai. In the past, when S. Vietnamese were wounded
                        in Cambodia, they were allowed time to recover. But now the war has merged
                        the three countries into one battlefield - this can be seen from fact that
                        puppet forces go in and out, U.S. troops have been there, air and <pb n="8" xml:id="d126-08" facs="d126-08"/>naval forces have been used. So they
                        think it a matter of course for the North Vietnamese troops to come to their
                        assistance at this time. Once the war ends, all troops from any foreign
                        countries should withdraw leaving integrity and original borders maintained.
                        I am convinced, and believe, that this view of Prince Sihanouk is
                        correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - I have the highest respect
                        for him - he knows it - the U.S. Government knows it - I understand
                        Cambodian protocol - the message from you as to his position will be
                        conveyed to the U.S. Government. I don't think Lan Nol represents the
                        Cambodian people - I think <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>
                        does.</p>
                    <p>Premier - The position of Sihanouk is not to recognize the Lan Nol
                        government.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> will have to decide the future of
                        his own country.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Very unfortunate that the U.S., U.S.S.R. and Britain also recognize
                        Lan Nol, although we do not. This emotionally insults <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - Would like to conclude on
                        subject of U.N. but one question of central point of difference: Taiwan.
                        What are your feelings as to a timetable of withdrawal and how do you expect
                        to reclaim Taiwan? It is a difficult question but must be faced.</p>
                    <p>Premier - No question - we also discussed that with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. And on this point I can only stand
                        by our agreement that we should not discuss any issue we talked about - I
                        can only say two sentences: (1) In any case, Taiwan will eventually return
                        to the embrace of its motherland, and (2) in any case, the U.S. will finally
                        withdraw all its troops from Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - 8,000 of 10,000 troops
                        tied into Viet-Nam—in many cases, fleet in Taiwan Straits does not include
                        U.S. vessels - at other times, two U.S. destroyers. Both Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> have always said there is only one China—<persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> also said Tibet was a part
                        of China, also the rectification of the McMahon line with India.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d126-09" facs="d126-09"/>
                    <p>Premier - Something else I would like to point out - with regard to
                        relaxation of tensions, the key issue is still the war in Indo-China—all
                        other issues—Japan-Taiwan-Korea would be easy to resolve if war was
                        ended.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - All questions regarding
                        prisoners in China raised and referred to Mr. Chiao request consideration of
                        their cases and assurances as to their health.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - This is also my earnest
                        request.</p>
                    <p>Premier - I agree to conveyance to our Institute of Foreign Affairs. These
                        matters must be dealt with separately Downey's term has been cut to a
                        remainder of 5 years - his Mother is quite old and would like to see him -
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> mentioned it. We're
                        considering it—other two pilots a different matter. Journalist (Salzberger)
                        easier - we'll try. When you go back to report to your President, is your
                        duty and you must report to the Senate - I hope you will not make it
                        official - I would hope that you would stress informal nature of discussions
                        and that you would make clear that these were not diplomatic
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Yes, informal, but would like
                        to report anecdotes and general nature of our talks and topics.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Yes, to add color, would hope you would not print report.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> - We may have to print - and
                        we'd like to - it could only lead to better understanding and relationships
                        between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Premier - But we hope not to involve other countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> &amp; <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> - Express great thanks for inviting
                        us and for being so frank.</p>
                    <p>Premier - Although there is a question of Taiwan, and India occupies 90,000
                        square kilometers of Chinese territory, we are not an aggressive country and
                        I'm glad both Senators noted that. We want to build up our own country - our
                        country is big enough, our land is vast enough, our people are many <pb n="10" xml:id="d126-10" facs="d126-10"/>so we have enough to do in our
                        own country. I recommend you read Neville Maxwell's book, “India's China
                        War”—very fair book. I want to thank you for the warm welcome given in your
                        country to our table tennis team and please convey the friendship of the

                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the meeting was to give the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> an initial report of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s discussions in Moscow from April 20-24, as Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had promised the
                        Ambassador at their meeting on April 18. This meeting was also an occasion
                        to reply to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> note of April 18 which
                        complained of a new intrusion into <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        territorial waters near Hainan Island.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: There was not much
                        traffic in the city today.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We came here at a very fast speed.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I have something for
                        the Ambassador and I understand you have something for us. Why don't you
                        begin and give us what you have. I'll be prepared to discuss at some length
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have a very short message, so why
                        don't we go first.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is very disappointed that he
                        could not come here, but the President is giving a speech tonight and going
                        to Florida, and he has to go with him. But he hopes to see you next week and
                        give a more detailed report, but I can give you quite a bit this
                        evening.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d127-02" facs="d127-02"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: He is very busy. We admire his energy.
                        [laughter] My message is as follows [reads from note:] “The Chinese side has
                        learned the content of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s talk of April 18 and thanks him for the information
                        he has made available to the Chinese side. With regard to the time of Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to China in
                        June, we would prefer June 21-25 as the tentative date.”</p>
                    <p>That is all.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Very good. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wanted me to give you a
                        preliminary and prompt, very prompt, report on his recent visit to
                        Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> is also working on the
                        President's speech, so I brought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RPW1">Rodman</persName> along, who sat in on the meetings, all the meetings,
                        in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Good.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> hopes to visit with you here,
                        perhaps at the end of next week. This difficulty we had this week leads me
                        to ask whether or not if something ever develops of an emergency nature and
                        needed a meeting between you and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, would you perhaps be willing to travel sometimes
                        to Washington - (we could provide transportation, etc.), if perhaps it was
                        impossible for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to leave
                        the President?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I will have to get instructions from
                        my Government on this point.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: We would do this in
                        case of an emergency, if we needed a meeting promptly but for some reason
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> couldn't come. We would
                        provide secure means for you to come, and so forth—if this is convenient for
                        you.</p>
                    <p>As for the first order of business, I would like to reply to your message for
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> of April 18. You recall
                        we said we would look into the incident of the intrusion over Hainan
                        Island,</p>
                    <p>We have confirmed that there was an intrusion by a U.S. radio relay aircraft
                        which inadvertently approached Hainan at the time you indicated. At the time
                        of the incident, our radar picked up this fact as the aircraft was
                        approaching 12 miles from the territorial boundary and we ordered it away
                        immediately. We have forcefully reiterated our orders that U.S. aircraft
                        must stay outside of Chinese territorial limits. We regret this <pb n="3" xml:id="d127-03" facs="d127-03"/>accidental intrusion, and we are doing
                        our very best to prevent any recurrence in the future.</p>
                    <p>Now, if I may, I would like to talk in some detail of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to Moscow and some of the
                        occurrences there.</p>
                    <p>You will recall, as he told you last time, he had been invited there to
                        review preparations for the U.S.-Soviet Summit as well as the overall
                        international situation. Despite our position and policy of turning down
                        such invitations, on this occasion the President approved the visit because
                        of the international situation, which had become somewhat more tense. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked me to emphasize
                        that the general principles that we have outlined to Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-ial</persName> remained in full force during
                        this visit. Nothing was discussed or agreed upon in any way which could harm
                        the interests of the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>The main emphasis was on preparations for the Summit and on bilateral
                        matters. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> outlined our
                        position on Vietnam as he has outlined it to your Government.</p>
                    <p>First, on the Summit, the agenda for the May meeting was discussed, covering
                        the topics which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has
                        outlined to you earlier. Progress was made on certain items. One very
                        definite impression was that the Soviet leaders are very anxious that the
                        Summit go on and that it include as many bilateral agreements as can be
                        negotiated. For our part, we intend to go forward with the Summit, assuming
                        the international situation does not deteriorate between now and the
                        scheduled date. We will ourselves conclude whatever bilateral agreements we
                        determine to be in our national interest during this meeting.</p>
                    <p>This information is very sensitive. We would hope you would confine it to
                        yourself and Premier Chou and his closest advisers. There were significant
                        discussions on strategic arms limitation, what we call <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>. You recall that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned there were two
                        remaining issues in the formal negotiations: (1) anti-ballistic missile
                        limitation, and (2) the question of a freeze on submarine-launched missiles.
                        Regarding <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, it was a question of the
                        number of sites for each side, and on <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s, it was a question of whether there should be a freeze on
                        submarinelaunched missiles.</p>
                    <p>[Miss Shih and the Ambassador then talked back and forth about the
                        translation of some of the terms. The word “sites” (in English) was heard.
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d127-04" facs="d127-04"/>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> volunteered the spelling of it and
                        offered to be of help if Miss Shih didn't get it all clearly.]</p>
                    <p>On both these questions, there was significant progress, and we believe a
                        sound <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> agreement is possible and could
                        be concluded by or during the May trip. There are many details yet to be
                        worked out, but it could be easily completed by the Summit.</p>
                    <p>I wish to emphasize again how sensitive this is. Because our own bureaucracy
                        knows nothing of this either.</p>
                    <p>There were also generally inconclusive discussions on European issues. The
                        local election in West Germany, the defection of a member of the ruling
                        coalition, and the vote which comes tomorrow [the confidence vote in the
                        Bundestag] were all discussed. It is obvious that the Soviets are concerned
                        that these events in West Germany could jeopardize ratification of the
                        Treaties and with them the overall Soviet policy in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets also expressed great interest in increased trade, with better
                        long-term credit arrangements with the U.S. Government. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed interest in this and
                        support for this, providing that the international climate was conducive to
                        these kinds of events.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of other bilateral issues, which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned to you in his last
                        meeting, specifically space cooperation, cooperation on problems of the
                        environment. Certainly there is a great prospect of progress in both these
                        areas, and we would forsee the creation of joint commissions to carry
                        forward the work in these areas.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there was some preliminary drafting of the joint communique for the
                        visit. There was not enough time to finish everything.</p>
                    <p>On Vietnam, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had some
                        very lengthy discussions with Soviet leaders. He presented the Presidents
                        position to them—which he has also outlined to you. This presentation
                        included the following major points:</p>
                    <p>— The President is determined to bring the conflict to an honorable
                        conclusion, hopefully by negotiations but if that is not possible by a very
                        resolute pursuit of his unilateral course. This will be done at whatever the
                        risk to other U.S. policies. [The Ambassador was impassive but somber
                        through all of this.]</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d127-05" facs="d127-05"/>
                    <p>— The U.S. side did not seek an escalation to the fighting. Our every effort
                        has been just to the contrary—to wind down the war, end our involvement, and
                        seek a negotiated settlement.</p>
                    <p>— On the other hand, North Vietnam's response to these efforts was to refuse
                        to negotiate, and ultimately to launch a massive attack across the
                        Demilitarized Zone and elsewhere in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>— For our part, we have met this offensive with certain actions. We shall
                        maintain this response—and perhaps other responses—until the North
                        Vietnamese offensive is halted.</p>
                    <p>— Despite the continuation of the enemy's offensive, or Hanoi's offensive, we
                        are resuming the plenary sessions of the Paris Conference this Thursday,
                        because the North Vietnamese have been so insistent, and we are willing to
                        hear what they have to say. We will not on this occasion just listen to the
                        sterile propaganda which has characterized past plenary sessions. As far as
                        we are concerned, the first order of business is the discussion of measures
                        designed to stop the North Vietnamese invasion. This in turn would enable us
                        to deescalate our operations. Then we could both get on to the business of
                        negotiating a settlement.</p>
                    <p>— Specifically, our position is that North Vietnam must withdraw those
                        divisions which it sent into South Vietnam since March 30, They should
                        return to the situation as it existed then and restore the 1968
                        understandings. Then there should be a genuine negotiation for a peace
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>— The President remains ready to be generous in the terms for a negotiated
                        settlement. The U.S. proposals are not made on a take-it-or-leave-it
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>We seek a settlement fair to both sides, and therefore one that will last.
                        But the President will not negotiate at the point of a gun. He will not
                        allow North Vietnam to try to embarrass us. He views their offensive as a
                        challenge not just to South Vietnam but to the institution of the American
                        Presidency and to the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>You will recall in discussions with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that he pointed out we had been going back and
                        forth with Hanoi on the scheduling of private meetings. Our willingness to
                        go to Thursday's Plenary on the 27th of <pb n="6" xml:id="d127-06" facs="d127-06"/>April was on the condition that a private meeting
                        between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> would take place no
                        later than May 2. Now, the North Vietnamese have accepted this, and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will travel secretly to
                        Paris on May 2. At that meeting, we will press for an end of the invasion, a
                        return to the March 30 position, and for a reestablishment of the 1968
                        understanding with respect to the DMZ. If the North Vietnamese will not talk
                        seriously at that private meeting, they certainly will not talk seriously at
                        the Plenary session. Thus if the May 2 meeting does not show real progress,
                        we will draw the appropriate conclusions, and act on them - at the
                        conference table, and on the battlefield.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added to me before I
                        left that it was very interesting to note that the Soviet side did not share
                        our view of who was responsible for the North Vietnamese offensive.</p>
                    <p>That in general is what was covered at the meetings, and it remains to be
                        seen what will come from those discussions.</p>
                    <p>Now, if I may, I would like to comment on one or two other topics.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Please.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: First, on the whole,
                        we were very pleased with the visit of your table-tennis team, and on the
                        whole they received a very warm welcome from the American people. The
                        President asked me to convey to you that he was especially pleased to have
                        the opportunity to meet them, and he was impressed with their demeanor and
                        appearance in the White House. I know there must have been some things that
                        didn't go as well as we both liked, but on the whole, it was a very
                        successful visit.</p>
                    <p>We will keep you informed as we move towards the Soviet Summit. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> very much looks forward to giving
                        his personal report to the Premier on his visit in June. I will be back
                        shortly with confirmation on the dates. We would like again to recall that
                        we would still adhere to the general principle that we are prepared to
                        conclude with the People's Republic of China similar agreements to any that
                        we might work out with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I think that concludes all the business of the day, Mr. Ambassador,</p>
                    <p>If you have anything I can bring back to Dr, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, I will see him before he goes with the President
                        to Florida tonight.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d127-07" facs="d127-07"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have nothing more to discuss with
                        you and I have no other messages to convey. I will promptly report to
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> what you have said
                        just now. I will also appreciate thanking Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for the ping-pong team's visit here.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I hope spring in New
                        York … the weather will be more suitable—much like the weather in
                        Hangchow—and that you are comfortable in your new quarters.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Thank you very much. Our new quarters
                        are very comfortable. It is much quieter than the Roosevelt. [laughter]</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: When the weather is
                        good, the Ambassador should take a trip up the Hudson, it is very
                        beautiful,</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: We are very pleased to live in our new
                        quarters. Because now we can change the food to suit our taste.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: You have your own
                        kitchen now! I wish events would permit me to visit you for dinner, because
                        I have never had better food than in China.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Maybe next time when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> goes to China you can go with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: No, when he goes, I
                        have to stay.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Ah. Well, thank you, General.</p>
                    <p>[The meeting was formally ended, and their car was summoned. The conversation
                        started up again, however.]</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: There will be a no-confidence vote
                        tomorrow in Germany.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: They will not vote
                        no-confidence, but there will be a vote on the question of no
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: What will happen?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: It may affect his
                        ability to deliver on the German-Soviet Treaties,</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: What will the differences of the votes
                        be?</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d127-08" facs="d127-08"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: It is hard to
                        speculate. One or two votes will decide. There have been shifts in loyalties
                        in the coalition.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: It appears that the Soviet Union and
                        other European countries are very concerned about it.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes. The cause of the
                        vote is economic policies, but the real cause is much more fundamental.</p>
                    <p>Is your trip here from your new quarters shorter than from the Hotel?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Longer.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: We will rush back
                        tonight and the President will give a speech at 10 o'clock on television.
                        Then we send Henry to Florida to get some sun.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: There was an article by James Reston
                        today.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes! I don't know
                        that that will make Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> too
                        popular.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: James Reston has a very high appraisal
                        of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: We consider James
                        Reston the guardian angel of our opposition party. There are some
                        Republicans who say that if you have him for a friend, you need no enemies.

                    <p>When I arrived at 8:45 p.m., Miss Shih explained that the Ambassador could
                        not make it back from his dinner and reception until 9:00 p.m. It was not
                        completely under his control, she said (apparently he was a principal
                        guest), and she apologized. She invited me to sit down for some tea. It was
                        jasmine. She apologized for that too, since, as she recalled it, the
                        Ambassador had promised me green tea this time.</p>
                    <p>I explained that I was carrying a letter from the President to Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> [attached] which we
                        wanted to deliver in advance of the President's speech at 9:00 p.m. I handed
                        over the letter to her, and agreed to wait for the Ambassador. She did not
                        read it. We chatted pleasantly about where she had learned English (in
                        Peking) and about the difference between British and American accents.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Huang Hua</persName> arrived a little
                        before 9:00 p.m. I told him I had a letter and that we had wanted to deliver
                        it before the President's speech.</p>
                    <p>He sat down to read it and offered me a second cup of tea in the meantime. He
                        read it slowly, almost laboriously, with a somber expression on his face.
                        When he finished, he put it back in the envelopes and said he would see that
                        it was conveyed to the Prime Minister. He asked if I had any additional
                        message to convey, and I said I did not.</p>
                    <p>He then brought up the fact that on an earlier occasion we had asked him
                        whether it would be possible for him to go to Washington to meet with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in case Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be unable to come to New
                        York.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d128-02" facs="d128-02"/>
                    <p>“At present,” the Ambassador said,”It is not convenient for us to go to
                        Washington. We understand that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is very busy with his work. In case he is busy and
                        cannot come here, he can send someone he trusts to convey the message.” This
                        was not quite responsive to our proposal, which referred to emergencies when
                        a meeting would be necessary. But I said simply that I would report it to
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>It was my impression that his reply was simply carrying out prior
                        instructions, that it was the reason why Miss Shih had encouraged me to wait
                        for him, and that it was not induced by the content of the President's
                        letter.</p>
                    <p>There was additional pleasant small talk while we finished our tea. The
                        pandas came up again, and he also asked how I was getting back. He asked,
                        interestingly, how long Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        had been back from Paris. I explained that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had been in Paris on Tuesday, May 2. He asked when
                        the President was speaking, and I said 9:00 o'clock. (It was already about
                        9:10.)</p>
                    <p>He offered me a third cup of tea. I thanked him, but politely declined
                        because (as I had explained earlier) I had to catch the 10:00 plane. After
                        handshakes and smiles all around, Miss Shih accompanied me downstairs.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am sorry we are late.
                        There was good deal of traffic. I read about the Ambassador in cables all
                        the time. I have brought along a red folder with me in your honor.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to see the Ambassador to tell him about our plans for the next few
                        weeks, for the information of the Chinese Government. It now appears that
                        the President's visit to Moscow is going forward, and in the spirit of
                        previous exchanges I wanted to keep you informed about the present stage of
                        these discussions.</p>
                    <p>First, a technical matter, I will be gone from May 20 to June 2. In my
                        absence General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> will have
                        full authority to receive messages and you should get in touch with him. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> will be with me.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: (To Mrs. Shih) You can call
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> at the same extension
                        numbers I gave you for me.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>) has been in China twice with us.</p>
                    <p>I have told you before that we understand the Soviet intention at this Summit
                        meeting is to have the maximum number of agreements with us, and therefore
                        they have delayed a number of negotiations so that they can be announced in
                        Moscow. I have prepared a paper which lists the agreements <pb n="2" xml:id="d129-02" facs="d129-02"/>that are likely to be concluded and the
                        major content of these agreements. Perhaps rather than reading it to you, it
                        would be simpler if I gave it to you. (He hands over a memorandum, attached
                        at Tab A) This is for … this is, of course, very confidential. (The
                        Ambassador and Mrs. Shih skimmed it quickly.)</p>
                    <p>These are the major provisions of the agreements. They can change slightly,
                        but this is how it now looks.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Soviet Union has proposed to us two other agreements which
                        we are in the process of discussing and on which we therefore cannot give
                        you the outline, but I can summarize them for you.</p>
                    <p>They would like us to state some common principles affecting the United
                        States and the Soviet Union, somewhat similar to the principles which we
                        signed affecting the People's Republic and the United States. These are
                        still in the process of being discussed, but I want to summarize them for
                        the Prime Minister. (He then reads from the document attached at Tab B.)</p>
                    <p>The first affirms the principle of peaceful coexistence.</p>
                    <p>The second deals with the need to exercise restraint on bilateral relations
                        and to conduct negotiations on the basis of reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>The third will deal with the responsibility of both countries to prevent
                        conflicts and tensions in the world generally and will state that no country
                        should be subject to external influence or outside pressures.</p>
                    <p>The fourth will deal with the desirability of placing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations on a firmer juridical basis.</p>
                    <p>The fifth will express the need, the desire of continuing the exchange of
                        views at all levels.</p>
                    <p>The sixth will affirm the interests of both sides to continue efforts to
                        limiting armaments.</p>
                    <p>This is assuming we can find correct formulations, and I would rather deal
                        with your Vice Foreign Minister. Also Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> is a
                        master in English. He knows it better than we do. (The Chinese side then
                        indicated that they thought there was some confusion between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName> and Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>.)
                        I mean the Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> who just now was promoted. In
                        fact, I don't know <pb n="3" xml:id="d129-03" facs="d129-03"/>whether it is
                        appropriate but let me convey my best wishes to my friends from previous
                        visits about their promotions which I read in the newspapers.</p>
                    <p>The seventh, eight, ninth, and tenth points will deal with these agreements
                        that are announced here.</p>
                    <p>The eleventh, which we are insisting on very much, renounces any special
                        rights for either side and says that neither recognizes special claims for
                        the other. And it also stipulates that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations are not directed against any other country.</p>
                    <p>The twelfth point states that nothing agreed to here affects previous
                        understandings, agreements or obligations.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, I want to point out that the People's Republic is the only
                        government we have informed of these matters. We have not informed any of
                        our allies.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Soviet Union has proposed to us that we sign an agreement
                        that we have renounced the use of nuclear weapons against each other. We
                        have responded that we cannot consider an agreement that implies the right
                        to use nuclear weapons against other countries. And this will probably prove
                        to be an insoluble problem. At any rate, if we do anything with respect to
                        nuclear weapons, it will be a general formulation applying to all countries
                        and not just the Soviet Union, a general attitude toward nuclear weapons
                        rather than specific obligations.</p>
                    <p>The other subjects that are likely to be discussed concern European matters,
                        specifically mutual force reductions, and the Soviet proposal of a European
                        Security Conference.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly the issue of Indochina will be raised. On Indochina we will take
                        the position which you know. It will be exactly as we told you.</p>
                    <p>Now we want to reaffirm the enormous importance we place in our relationship
                        with the People's Republic. We will not knowingly sign agreements directed
                        against your interests. And we are prepared to sign any agreement with you
                        that we have signed or will sign with the Soviet Union, adapted of course to
                        our special conditions. Also, if the People's Republic expressed any concern
                        with respect to any aspect, that would be taken with extreme seriousness by
                        us. There should be no reluctance on your part to do that.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d129-04" facs="d129-04"/>
                    <p>One other matter, with respect to Indochina, which we simply want to inform
                        you of. We have had proposals from various sources to resume plenary
                        sessions. We see no sense in plenary sessions unless there is some prospect
                        for a useful discussion. We have therefore proposed a private meeting next
                        Sunday in Paris to see whether any basis exists for making rapid progress.
                        And we are prepared to be forthcoming and flexible.</p>
                    <p>We understand your reluctance to become involved in this issue, but we wanted
                        to express one general view. We have no interest in humiliating North
                        Vietnam. If North Vietnam—I have often felt—dealt with us with 30 percent of
                        the wisdom of your Prime Minister, we would settle matters very quickly. The
                        basis of our discussions last July and afterwards were that we managed to
                        make a distinction between what could be done immediately and what has to be
                        left to history. If the Democratic Republic of Vietnam could ever bring
                        itself to make that distinction we could settle this matter very quickly,
                        and I believe satisfactorily to all sides.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to make one other comment which rose out of a statement I read in
                        the newspaper today which may not be accurately reported, in which your
                        Prime Minister seemed to think that our recent actions in Vietnam were not
                        consistent with the Shanghai communique, and that there was some concern
                        about whether we really keep our promises.</p>
                    <p>We feel that in our relationship with the People's Republic we have been very
                        meticulous to keep every promise we have made, whether it is formal or
                        informal, and my presence here is an indication of that. We have told you on
                        at least six occasions since our visit to Peking that if military measures
                        were used against us, we would have to respond strongly. Out of respect for
                        the Prime Minister, we took no actions in March while the offensive was
                        being prepared. And we were given no choice by an offensive that was
                        continuing even while we were attempting to start negotiations.</p>
                    <p>But we have stated our point of view often, and I simply want to reiterate
                        that every promise that we have made to the People's Republic will be kept
                        strictly, both in letter and in the spirit of our understanding.</p>
                    <p>I have only two more matters if the Ambassador can be patient with me. First
                        is to tell you that Senators <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_SHD2">Scott</persName> returned from China with
                        all the enthusiasm that other visitors have shown. And they speak of their
                        visit now with the slight nostalgia that we all feel that have been exposed
                        to Chinese hospitality. They have submitted a very positive report to the
                        President.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d129-05" facs="d129-05"/>
                    <p>The other point I wanted to mention, since I will be gone for two weeks, I
                        will contact you, of course, immediately upon our return from the Soviet
                        Union to speak to you; it will be around June 3.</p>
                    <p>But as you know, we had a tentative plan for me to visit the People's
                        Republic on June 21. And I wanted to suggest that we might announce that
                        around June 13. There is a text which we are proposing, but the new
                        assistant minister (Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>) will no doubt have a
                        much more eloquent version. (He hands over the text at Tab C.) There is no
                        need for you to reply now. (The Ambassador and Mrs. Shih read the text.) We
                        propose to make this announcement on June 13 at 11 o'clock in the
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>Miss Shih: Washington time?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. We can do it at 4
                        in the afternoon if that is better for you. That would be about five days
                        before I leave.</p>
                    <p>Mrs Shih: What is the time difference between Washington and Peking?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Twelve hours. You can
                        pick any time between 11 and 4, or you can do it earlier in the day.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: That is all?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One other matter. You
                        remember that I was planning twice already to go to Japan on a private
                        visit. (Ambassador Huang chuckles.) I am now planning to go around June 5
                        for three days. But it is an unofficial visit and it has the same purpose
                        that I have already described to you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Doctor, you have mentioned just now
                        the situation in Vietnam. I think you have noticed the statement issued by
                        the Government of the People's Republic of China recently.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: In the view of the Chinese Government,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s announcement on May
                        8 involving the recent actions was not aimed at ending the war but
                        escalating the war. In its statement the Chinese Government has expressed
                        its views very clearly. No matter what form the war may assume, whether
                        ground forces or air forces or naval forces, whether fought by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government troops or the puppet troops, no
                        matter what happens, the Chinese Government will support the Vietnamese
                        people in their resistance against the aggression of the United States and
                        for <pb n="6" xml:id="d129-06" facs="d129-06"/>national salvation, to final
                        victory. This stand of the Chinese Government is firm and unshakeable.</p>
                    <p>Another matter is about the telephone call made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> to me (Mrs. Shih) about the incident in
                        which two Chinese ships were attacked near the Hon Ngu Island on May 6, 7
                        and 8th. That caused some injuries among the Chinese crew and Vietnamese
                        workers aboard the ships and also caused damage among the ships. Your side
                        has promised to make an investigation regarding the incident and, depending
                        upon that, make an apology and compensation. I wonder what the result is of
                        your investigation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The primary result up
                        to now, which I just received before I came here, is as follows: First, no
                        attacks on Chinese ships are ever authorized under any circumstances, and
                        our airplanes are prohibited from approaching your territorial limits. Our
                        investigation has shown that there were attacks on North Vietnamese small
                        ships that were taking cargo from your ship and bringing it ashore. We can
                        therefore - while we have no certain knowledge - it was very plausible that
                        your ships were accidentally hit. Moreover, our experience is that you never
                        protest frivolously. And we therefore consider it very likely and
                        practically certain that what you say is correct.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, on behalf of the President, I would like to express our regret for
                        this action. As for the question of compensation, we are in principle
                        willing to do this, but we must discuss it with our legal people as to how
                        to go about it.</p>
                    <p>With respect to your first point, we have always respected your principled
                        stand. We only wonder whether some service could not be rendered to your
                        heroic ally by giving them a somewhat longer vision. What possible interest
                        could we have to have a permanent position in Southeast Asia? And any
                        thoughtful observer must come to the conclusion - I can assure you that what
                        we are trying to arrange is an honorable withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>We are not the country trying to seek a permanent position in Southeast Asia.
                        Nor are we the country which has any intention of threatening the People's
                        Republic of China. But we do not believe it is in anybody's interests to
                        have this solution forced by military means. We will approach <pb n="7" xml:id="d129-07" facs="d129-07"/>negotiations with an attitude of
                        goodwill. But we recognize the big gulf of suspicion that separates us - not
                        you and us, but us and the Vietnamese. I can only repeat that we seek no
                        permanent bases, no permanent position in this area, Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Doctor, you probably know the history
                        of the war in Indochina, and we know the history very well. The present
                        military situation in the war developed by the U. S. in its aggression has
                        been created by the acts of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> itself.
                        There is an old Chinese saying: “Those who tie the ring, should undo
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>In our view this is not a very complicated question. It is very simple, as
                        stated in the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>But I won't argue with you on this question. And I will surely report, convey
                        the message you have just said to Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName>, the information you have made available to Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                    <p>As to the date and timing of your visit to China, the announcement of your
                        visit to China after your visit to the Soviet Union, when I have
                        instructions, I will let you know.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Perhaps you can let me
                        know the proposed time for the arrival of the airplane crew, etc., the usual
                        technical information.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes. Sure.</p>
                    <p>About the incident concerning the two Chinese ships that were attacked near
                        Hon Ngu Island off of the shore of Vietnam. We have made a very solid
                        investigation and there is no doubt about it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We accept your facts.
                        If you will give some estimates on the damage, I will take appropriate
                        action. And we have given the strictest orders that we hope will prevent a
                        repetition.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> : I will let you know after making some
                        inquiries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Or you can do it
                        through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I have no more to say.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d129-08" facs="d129-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is always a pleasure
                        to see you, Mr. Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: I am not quite clear about the points
                        11 and 12 that you mentioned just now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the principles?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Point 11 renounces any
                        special rights or advantages which may be claimed. We have inserted this,
                        for your information, because we do not recognize the Brezhnev Doctrine, and
                        it affirms that all states, the relations of all states must be based on the
                        principle of sovereign equality and that nothing in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations can be construed by either party as
                        directed against a third country.</p>
                    <p>The 12th point. This is the point we are insisting on, and formulating it is
                        a little bit complex. The 12th point is a positive formulation of the 11th.
                        It says nothing agreed on can affect any obligation with respect to other
                        countries or understandings with respect to other countries earlier assumed
                        by the two parties. In other words, it does not supersede any other
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>: What would be the example for point 11
                        in specific instances?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In specific instances,
                        in point 11, we interpret it to mean that the Brezhnev Doctrine is no longer
                        valid, that is a claim by the Soviet Union that it has a special right to
                        intervene in certain parts of the world. That is our intention.</p>
                    <p>I will see you as soon as I get back. Of course, in Peking we will have full
                        discussions with the Prime Minister and anyone he may, designate, but I
                        won't wait for that. I will see you first.</p>
                    <p>(The formal meeting then adjourned. There was some small talk while the
                        Chinese were waiting for their car. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> commented that the Chinese ping-pong team had made
                        a good impression. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> asked when
                        the pool at the Chinese Mission would be open, and Mrs. Shih <pb n="9" xml:id="d129-09" facs="d129-09"/>said this would be in June. Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> confirmed that it was unheated and outdoors.
                        He said that their new quarters were much more convenient and more
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he did not
                        know whether personal feelings were allowed in his job, but he had developed
                        them toward the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>He noted that the Ambassador had said that it was not convenient now for him
                        to come to Washington. Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> said that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> could send Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> or someone else, if
                        necessary. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that at
                        some point maybe the Ambassador could come up to Camp
                            <persName>David</persName> which was secluded and serviced by a military
                        airport.</p>
                    <p>(The car then arrived and the Chinese departed.)</p>

                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d129-10" facs="d129-10"/>
                    <p>Strategic Arms Limitation: An agreement in this field has been under
                        negotiation since 1969. It is now expected that it will be completed in two
                        parts: the first will be a treaty limiting <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, the second an interim agreement freezing certain
                        strategic offensive systems.</p>
                    <p>As regards <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, each side would be limited
                        to two deployment areas, one around its capital city, the other in an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> field. The Soviet Union already has in
                        place an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense of the Moscow area and
                        the United States is constructing an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        defense in its <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> field at Grand Forks,
                        Montana. There would also be radar limits to ensure that neither side could
                        establish the radar base for subsequent deployment of a territorial <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense. There will also be other
                        provisions limiting activities in the strategic defensive field, all of
                        which are designed to hold the two sides to only two permitted deployments.
                        Verification will be by the national means of each side.</p>
                    <p>The offensive agreement will place ceilings on <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and submarine-based strategic launchers. Each side would
                        be held to its present number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s,
                        operational or under construction, and to submarines and launchers presently
                        operational and under construction. Old <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s could be converted into submarines and submarine-based
                        launchers. This arrangement would have a five-year duration, during which a
                        more permanent offensive limitation would be negotiated.</p>
                    <p>In the interim five-year agreement there would be no qualitative limitations,
                        and replacement and modernization would be permitted, provided the agreed
                        ceilings are not exceeded. Verification would be by the national means of
                        each side.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that negotiations for a more definitive offensive limitation
                        agreement would take place, beginning in the near future.</p>
                    <p>Space Cooperation: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably agree to enhance
                        cooperation in outer space by utilizing the capabilities of both countries
                        for joint projects of mutual benefit. The National Aeronautical and Space
                        Agency and the Soviet Academy of Sciences would oversee implementation of
                        the agreement. Under the agreement the rendezvous and docking systems of
                        American and Soviet spacecraft would be made compatible so <pb n="11" xml:id="d129-11" facs="d129-11"/>as to provide for joint missions and
                        rescue operations. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would agree to a joint, manned space
                        flight in 1975 using Apollo type and Soyuz-type spacecraft. The two
                        spacecraft would rendezvous and dock in space, and the cosmonauts and
                        astronauts would visit the respective spacecraft.</p>
                    <p>Environmental Agreement: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably agree to establish closer
                        and longerterm cooperation between interested organizations in the
                        environmental field. A new <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Joint Committee on Cooperation in the
                        Field of Environmental Protection is being established to approve bilateral
                        measures and programs of cooperation and make recommendations to the two
                        Governments. Each country would designate a principal coordinator—on the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side this would be the Chairman of the
                        Council on Environment. This cooperation would be aimed at solving the most
                        important aspects of the problems of the environment, including work in the
                        following fields: air pollution; water pollution; environmental pollution
                        associated with agricultural production; enhancement of the urban
                        environment (this includes noise pollution); preservation of nature and
                        organization of preserves; marine pollution; biological and genetic
                        consequences of environmental pollution; influence of environmental changes
                        on climate; earthquake prediction; arctic and subarctic ecological systems;
                        and legal and administrative measures for protecting environmental
                        quality.</p>
                    <p>Health Agreement: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are undertaking to develop and deepen
                        mutual cooperation in the field of medical science and public health. They
                        will probably agree to do so through the Joint Committee for Health
                        Cooperation which was established by the February 11, 1972 exchange of
                        letters between Ministers of Health. As agreed in that exchange of letters,
                        initial research efforts would be focused on cancer, heart diseases and the
                        environmental health sciences.</p>
                    <p>Science and Technology Agreement: A <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
                        Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation will probably be
                        established to identify, explore and set up appropriate joint programs. The
                        President's Science Adviser would chair the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side and negotiate the detailed arrangements for the
                        establishment of the new commission. Cooperation in these fields could
                        include the following: the exchange of scientists, specialists, and
                        scientific and technical information and documentation; joint development
                        and implementation of programs and projects in the fields of basic and <pb n="12" xml:id="d129-12" facs="d129-12"/>applied sciences; joint
                        research, development and testing and the exchange of research results and
                        experience between scientific and research institutes and organizations;
                        organization of joint courses, conferences and symposia; rendering of
                        appropriate help on both sides in establishing contacts and arrangements
                        between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> firms and Soviet enterprises where
                        a mutual interest develops.</p>
                    <p>Maritime Agreement: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and USSR may agree
                        to understandings on maritime and related matters which should facilitate an
                        expansion of commerce between the two countries. The understandings would
                        include provisions relating to port access, entry and treatment of ships of
                        one country in the ports of the other, and equal participation in cargo
                        carriage.</p>
                    <p>Incidents at Sea Agreement: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may agree to understandings designed to
                        prevent incidents at sea between units of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet Navies operating on the high seas. Provisions of
                        the understandings would deal with such issues as observation of the letter
                        and spirit of the international rules of the road; avoidance of specified
                        types of harassment and simulated attacks; measures to be taken so as not to
                        hinder maneuvers such as carrier operations; general distances to be
                        observed in aircraft-to-aircraft approaches and aircraft-to-ship approaches.
                        The Defense Ministers would sign an agreement for the two countries.</p>
                    <p>Joint Commercial Commission: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably agree to establish a Joint
                        Commercial Commission to translate bilateral commercial objectives agreed to
                        during the President's visit into specific agreements and actions. The
                        Commission would negotiate a bilateral trade agreement, work to resolve

                    <p>BASIC PRINCIPLES OF <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-SOVIET RELATIONS</p>
                    <p>It is expected that a document containing certain principles which would
                        guide <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations will be agreed and
                        published.</p>
                    <p>In addition to a preamble, there will be twelve points.</p>
                    <p>The first will say that in the nuclear age, there is no alternative to
                        conducting relations on the basis of peaceful co-existence and that
                        ideological and political differences are not obstacles to normal
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>The second will deal with the need to prevent dangerous exacerbations in
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, to exercise
                        restraint and to conduct negotiations on the basis of reciprocity. It will
                        also state that each side should recognize the security interests of the
                        other, based on the principle of equality and the renunciation of the threat
                        or use of force.</p>
                    <p>The third will deal with the responsibility of both countries to do what they
                        can to prevent conflicts and tensions in the world generally. It will state
                        that no country should be subject to external interference.</p>
                    <p>The fourth will deal with the desirability of placing US-Soviet relations on
                        a firmer juridical basis.</p>
                    <p>The fifth will express readiness to continue the practice of exchanging
                        views, including at the highest level.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d129-14" facs="d129-14"/>
                    <p>The sixth will affirm the intention of both sides to continue efforts toward
                        limiting armaments, in accordance with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Charter.</p>
                    <p>The seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth deal with improvement of various kinds
                        of concrete bilateral relations and cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The eleventh renounces any special rights or advantages for the two sides and
                        states that claims by any other country on this score would not be
                        recognized. It affirms the sovereign equality of all states. It also
                        stipulates that the development of US-Soviet relations is not directed
                        against third countries and their interests.</p>
                    <p>The twelfth point states that the principles agreed upon do not affect any
                        obligations with respect to other countries earlier assumed by the two
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>The principles thus cover the bilateral relationship of the United States and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and express certain objectives and
                        yardsticks concerning their respective conduct in international affairs.</p>

                    <p>In the joint communique issued in Shanghai in February 1972 at the conclusion
                        of President Nixonts visit, the United States and the People's Republic of
                        China agreed to stay in contact through various channels. The two sides
                        stated that this would include tithe sending of a senior U.S. representative
                        to Peking from time to time for concrete consultations to further the
                        normalization of relations between the two countries and continue to
                        exchange views on issues of common interest.”</p>
                    <p>Accordingly Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>,
                        Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, will visit the
                        People's Republic of China from June 21 to June 25, 1972 for discussions

                    </list>
                    <p>Following are brief highlights of my 45-minute session this morning with
                        Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>, which I already relayed to Dick
                        Kennedy.</p>
                    <p>Your trip to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>After I had finished my presentation on the Moscow summit, Ambassador
                            <persName>Huang</persName> read the following message from a typed
                        note:</p>
                    <p>“We agree to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit
                        from June 21 to June 25, but there is another important visit to China
                        beginning June 24 which cannot be put off. In order to avoid the two
                        meetings affecting each other we suggest that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> put his visit two days forward,
                        to 19-23 June, and we hope he will agree to it.</p>
                    <p>As to the time of the announcement we have agreed to your proposal that the
                        trip be announced June 13 at 11:00 a.m. Washington time, 11:00 p.m. Peking
                        time.</p>
                    <p>As to the content of the announcement, we suggest that it would be better to
                        be shorter, so we now make a proposal for your views.”</p>
                    <p>He handed over the text at Tab A. Our suggested text is at Tab B. In addition
                        to date change and shortening of the reference to the Shanghai communique,
                        the major change in the Chinese text is to say that you will talk with
                        “Chinese leaders” without mentioning specifically Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> as we did in our text, (Note:
                        Last October's announcement did not mention <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, but rather “talks with the Chinese Government.”) I
                        told the Ambassador that I would relay this information to you and that we
                        would respond as soon as possible concerning the date and the text of the
                        announcement. As for the day of the announcement, I pointed out <pb n="2" xml:id="d130-02" facs="d130-02"/>that I had told Mrs. Shih the previous
                        day that we now preferred June 14. I said that I would check this with you
                        again in the context of the changed dates that they were proposing.</p>
                    <p>Moscow Summit</p>
                    <p>I read my talking points to Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName> who
                        listened with impassive interest. The only question he asked was whether the
                        U.S. and the Soviet Union were prepared to discuss further the problem of
                        chemical weapons. I replied that, as the communique stated, we were prepared
                        to do so, in the multilateral forum.</p>
                    <p>Miscellaneous</p>
                    <p>I noted that your Japan trip was being announced today and that it was a
                        couple of days later than you had indicated to him. I also said that we were
                        pleased that arrangements were going forward smoothly on the Boggs/Ford trip
                        to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>; and I briefly explained and
                        handed over Joe Alsop's letter to you (Tab C).</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador and Mrs. Shih were very cordial throughout. He had no other
                        questions or subjects to raise. I started to leave on two occasions but he
                        beckoned me to stay for more tea.</p>
                    <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
                    <p>That I phone Mrs. Shih with information on your <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> trip.</p>
                    <p>1. New dates</p>

                    <p>Following are the brief highlights of my 25-minute meeting in New York today
                        with Ambassador <persName>Huang</persName>, covering two subjects, a <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> protest note on intrusion into its airspace
                        and the passing of information on your upcoming trip to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Protest</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador had requested this meeting sometime this afternoon or evening
                        with me or whomever you designated. I thus let him make the first move and
                        without elaboration he handed over the note attached at Tab A, suggesting
                        that I read it. After doing so slowly, I made the comments that you had
                        approved on a contingency basis for the previous meeting: I would report
                        this immediately to you; we would make an immediate investigation; this
                        would be either an accident or in violation of strict orders to stay clear
                        of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> airspace; the U.S. would have no
                        interest in violating <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> airspace. The
                        Ambassador's manner was pro forma, and the only comment that he made was
                        that he hoped we would have a response the next time we met. I said that we
                        would look into the matter immediately and give them a response as soon as
                        possible. (Note: The Chinese protest is mild, with the only interesting
                        aspect being the comment that “this intrusion was obviously not
                        inadvertent.”)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>After a brief pause the Ambassador then asked me whether we had answers to
                        the proposed new dates for your visit and the revised text of the
                        announcement. I pulled out our message, attached at Tab B, and gave him the
                        highlights before handing it over: We accepted the June 19-23 dates; we had
                        minor editorial changes in their proposed text; and we would like to make
                        the announcement at noon Washington time on June 14.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Ambassador's request, I pointed out the precise changes in
                        the text of the announcement which seemed to give him no problem. I said
                        that, of course, in the Chinese announcement the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> could come before the US. He then asked me if June 13 would
                        be inconvenient for announcing the trip. I replied that it would be, and
                        that we very much hoped to announce it on June 14. He then said that noon
                        Washington time would be midnight Peking time and that this was inconvenient
                        for them. I replied that I thought we might be able to agree to 11:00
                        o'clock, that I would check immediately upon my return to Washington, and
                        that I would call them right back. (Note As soon as I returned, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> told me that 11:00
                        o'clock was satisfactory and I relayed this to Mrs. Shih at 8:00 p.m.
                        today.)</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then read through our entire message, and I pointed out that
                        the technical information regarding the aircraft, etc. was similar to
                        previous trips. I added that it would not be possible for you to arrive in
                        Shanghai before 1700 on June 19.</p>
                    <p>We then engaged in about 10 minutes of small talk, during which the
                        Ambassador and Mrs. Shih were extremely friendly and made me stay for an
                        extra cup of tea.</p>

                    <p>At 11:24-11:28 hours on June 4, 1972 (Peking time), a group of four U.S.
                        military planes intruded into China's airspace over Pinghsiang area, Kwangsi
                        Province from the direction of Viet Nam and penetrated 20 kilometers in
                        width and 30 kilometers in depth. This intrusion was obviously not
                        inadvertent. Against this, the Chinese side lodges a protest with the U.S.
                        side and demands that the U.S. side take effective measures to stop the
                        recurrence of similar intrusions.</p>
                    <p>[Tab B]</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side accepts the revised dates proposed by the Chinese side for Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to the People's
                        Republic of China, i.e. June 19-23, 1972. It would like to make the joint
                        public announcement of this visit on June 14, 1972 at noon Washington time.
                        The U.S. side finds generally satisfactory the announcement handed over by
                        the Chinese side on June 3, 1972 but suggests some minor editorial changes
                        which are reflected in the attached text. The U.S. side would appreciate an
                        early response to the proposed text and date for the joint announcement.</p>
                    <p>Schedule and Party</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> plans to arrive in
                        Shanghai from either Guam or Anchorage, Alaska at approximately 17:00 local
                        time on June 19, 1972. He plans to depart from Peking at approximately 9:00
                        local time on June 23, 1972. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s party would include <persName corresp="#p_JAS1">Alfred le S. Jenkins</persName> from the State Department, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">John H. Holdridge</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston Lord</persName>, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Jonathan T. Howe</persName>, and either Richard H.
                        Solomon or Richard T. Campbell from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s staff. In addition, there would be three secret
                        service personnel and two secretaries. The final composition of the party
                        and their passport numbers, as well as the names and passport numbers of the
                        aircraft crew, will be provided in the very near future.</p>
                    <p>Aircraft</p>
                    <p>The party will travel in a Presidential Boeing 707 aircraft (aircraft tail
                        number 86972, call sign <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> 86972) similar
                        to that used on trips in October, January and February. Fuel and other
                        aircraft services needed will be the same as those provided during Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s October visit. It is
                        again desired that the aircraft be utilized for communications with
                        Washington. Therefore, it is requested that an external power source (115
                        volts, 400 cycles, 3 phase alternating current) and transportation for
                        couriers from the aircraft to the location of the party again be made
                        available around-the-clock. As before the aircraft would plan to communicate
                        on the following frequencies while in Peking:</p>
                    <p>Voice frequencies: 13215 kilos primary, 9015 kilos secondary, Upper sideband
                        voice</p>
                    <p>Teletype frequencies: 8047 kilos primary, 6995 kilos secondary.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the United States-People's Republic of China Joint
                        Communique of February 1972, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry

                        23, 1972, for concrete consultations with Chinese leaders to further the
                        normalization of relations between the People's Republic of China and the
                        United States and continue to exchange views on issues of common

                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>The conversation began in a cordial atmosphere of relaxed conversation in
                        which noncontroversial issues were discussed. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> had gotten to know Ambassador Ch'en
                        fairly well in the technical meetings and banquets during the October 1971
                        trip when the Ambassador represented the Ministry of Information in
                        discussing press plans for the President's trip.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Ch'en asked when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be returning from Japan and noted that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was certainly having a
                        busy schedule. He commented that it must be difficult to adjust to all the
                        time zone changes. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName>
                        replied that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> certainly
                        had a most demanding travelling schedule, but that he was a man of
                        tremendous capacity and endurance and was looking forward to returning to
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Ambassador Ch'en asked if <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston Lord</persName> was also in Japan and noted
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> and Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>
                        would be returning to China. Tea was served and the Ambassador asked if
                        Commander Howe liked it. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> indicated that he did and that the Chinese has most
                        generously given some to those who visited in October and February. The
                        Ambassador indicated that if Commander Howe ever wanted any there was always
                        plenty available at the Delegation. He also commented that there would be
                        many more travels to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>On a more serious note, Ambassador Ch'en stated that the reason for asking
                        someone to come up that day was because U.S. military planes had repeatedly
                        intruded into Chinese air space. Using type written notes he pointed out
                        that there had been a violation on June 4 which had been mentioned to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>. The Chinese had protested
                        the intrusion and had asked the U.S. side to take effective measures to
                        prevent recurrences. Subsequently, there were three <pb n="2" xml:id="d132-02" facs="d132-02"/>intrusions on the 9th of June. The
                        first had occurred in Kwangsi Province with the planes coming from the
                        direction of North Vietnam. The first two planes had intruded between 11:25
                        and 11:28 Peking time. The intrusions had occurred over many areas of
                        Kwangsi Province. He paused and asked if Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> knew the place and pointed out that
                        it was northeast of an important pass. He commented that the penetration had
                        been eight kilometers in depth.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the second incident he alleged that four planes had intruded
                        over the same area during the times 11:30 and 11:33 hours and penetrated in
                        an area 12 kilometers in width to three kilometers in depth. The third
                        violation occurred when the same batch of aircraft intruded over another
                        area northeast of Haiphong, near the border of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. This had occurred between 11:30 and 11:37 hours and the
                        planes had penetrated 30 kilometers in width and ten kilometers in depth. He
                        stated that the Chinese side was lodging a protest against the repeated
                        intrusions of U.S. planes while carrying out wanton bombing raids against
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and that they strongly demanded that
                        the U.S. side take effective measures to stop the recurrences of similar
                        intrusions.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Commander Howe stated that the U.S. side had taken the allegations
                        of June 4 most seriously and was conducting a very thorough investigation
                        with great earnestness. The U.S. side hoped to have the results of this
                        investigation within the next day or two. He then stated that if these
                        reports were confirmed they would be a violation of the procedures and
                        precautions which the U.S. side had established to guard against inadvertent
                        intrusions. The U.S. side would investigate these allegations with similar
                        earnestness and thoroughness.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador responded that he took note of the fact that the U.S. side was
                        conducting an investigation and that it was not U.S. policy to violate the
                        border. He asked that the U.S. side take serious measures to prevent
                        recurrences. On June 4 there had been an intrusion; five days later there
                        were now four intrusions. He reiterated the “strong demand” that the U.S.
                        side take measures to prevent a recurrence, and handed Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> a note which contained most of the
                        points made orally (Tab A). Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> read the note and indicated that the U.S. side took
                        these charges with the utmost seriousness and they would be investigated
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then indicated that his business was completed. Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> remarked that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> had told him a report had
                        been received <pb n="3" xml:id="d132-03" facs="d132-03"/>from Stockholm
                        where the Environmental Conference was being held, indicating that the
                        Chinese representatives had made a strong statement with regard to U.S.
                        policy. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> noted that
                        the response by the U.S. representative there would be non-polemic and
                        reasonable and would be measured and calm in tone. Ambassador Ch'en
                        commented that it was necessary for the Chinese delegation to express views
                        with regard to the bombing and mining of North Vietnam at this conference.
                        He supposed the U.S. delegation would make a response and wondered if it had
                        done so. Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> repeated
                        that he thought some mild statement would be made but indicated he did not
                        know when this would occur.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned to lighter subjects concerning the U.S. and
                        China and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s forthcoming
                        trip. Of interest was the very clear indication that the Chinese were
                        looking forward to the visit. They referred to arrangements for the “honored
                        guests” on several occasions. Commander Howe noted that we hoped to have in
                        the next day or two a complete list of the party, including aircraft crew
                        and passport numbers, and to provide certain other technical
                        information.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the serious discussion of the aircraft intrusions, the atmosphere
                        was very warm and friendly. The Chinese were obviously looking forward to
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s trip. Ambassador
                        Ch'en apologized for asking Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> to come to New York on a Saturday and hoped that it had
                        not been too difficult a trip. Commander Howe explained that his office,
                        like that of the Chinese, worked seven days a week and that it was nice to
                        get out in the sunshine and always a pleasure to see them. Indicative of the
                        courteous and pleasant atmosphere, Ambassador Ch'en offered a car to take
                        Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> to the airport but
                        this was politely declined.</p>

                    <p>Following the U.S. military planes' intrusion of China's airspace over
                        Pinghsiang area, Kwangsi Province on June 4, U.S. military planes again
                        intruded into China's Kwangsi Province from the direction of Viet Nam three
                        times in succession on June 9:</p>
                    <p>The first batch of two planes intruded into the airspace over Ningming area
                        at 11:25 - 11:28 hours (Peking time, the same hereafter) and penetrated 20
                        kilometers in width and 8 kilometers in depth; the second batch of four
                        planes intruded into the airspace over Ningming area at 11:32 - 11:33 hours
                        and penetrated 12 kilometers in width and 3 kilometers in depth; the same
                        batch of planes intruded into the airspace over Tunghsing area at 11:37 -
                        11:39 hours and penetrated 30 kilometers in width and 10 kilometers in
                        depth. The Chinese side once again lodges a protest with the U.S. side
                        against the repeated intrusions into China's airspace by U.S. military
                        planes while they are carrying out wanton bombing raids against the
                        Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and strongly demands that the U.S. side
                        immediately take effective measures to stop the recurrence of similar
                        intrusions.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>After serving tea and brief amenities, Ambassador Ch'en indicated that the
                        reason for asking Commander Howe to come up was the same as on the previous
                        day. U.S. aircraft had intruded again into Chinese air space and each time
                        it was more serious. The Ambassador, using prepared talking points, then
                        presented the latest Chinese note (Tab A).</p>
                    <p>In presenting the protest, the Ambassador said that on June 4 and 9 U.S.
                        military aircraft had on many occasions intruded into the air space of
                        Kwangsi Province. He said that the Chinese side had lodged protests with the
                        U.S. side on these occasions. They had also asked the U.S. side to take
                        effective measures to stop a recurrence of U.S. aircraft intruding into
                        Chinese air space. Messages had been delivered through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> and Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> on the last two occasions.</p>
                    <p>He then said that yesterday, June 10, from 056 to 058 hours, two sorties of
                        U.S. military aircraft had again intruded into Chinese air space. The second
                        sortie of U.S. military aircraft had even dropped bombs on the Pinghsiang
                        area of Kwangshi Province. Prior to that incident, on June 9, U.S. military
                        aircraft bombed around a Chinese merchant ship near Hon La Island of the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam at 2112 hours. The name of the ship was
                        HONGQI 150. Bomb splinters had seriously menaced Chinese personnel
                        there.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador continued that while carrying out repeated bombing of the
                        northern part of Vietnam the U.S. side has been pressing up toward China. In
                        addition to intrusions into Chinese air space, U.S. planes had bombed
                        civilian structures and Chinese merchant ships, menacing Chinese people.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d133-02" facs="d133-02"/>
                    <p>Against this the Chinese side lodged a strong protest to the U.S. side. The
                        U.S. side should understand that the Chinese side to date had exercised
                        restraint. This restraint could not possibly be unlimited. If the U.S. side
                        still failed to take effective measures it would inevitably affect measures
                        for normalization of the relations between the U.S. and China. This was the
                        message the Chinese side wished to convey to the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then handed a note to Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> (Tab A). After reading the note, Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> first clarified that the merchant
                        ship in the second paragraph of the note was the same merchant ship referred
                        to in the first paragraph and then responded by making the following
                        points:</p>
                    <p>— On the previous day when Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> returned to Washington the proper persons on the U.S.
                        side, including Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, had
                        been informed of the Chinese note and an immediate and intensive
                        investigation was instigated on an urgent basis into the allegations
                        contained in the note. Naturally it took some time for the instigation of
                        this investigation to have an effect but the U.S. side was investigating not
                        only the actual incidents referred to in the note but the entire system of
                        procedures used to guard against inadvertent violations of Chinese air
                        space. In light of these new and serious allegations the U.S. side would
                        intensify its investigation and would have a response within 48 hours.</p>
                    <p>— The U.S. side regretted any damage that might have occurred to a Chinese
                        ship or Chinese personnel. As had been stressed on the previous day, it was
                        certainly not the intention of the U.S. side to violate Chinese air space or
                        cause damage to Chinese people or property. The U.S. side views the
                        situation with the utmost seriousness and will certainly investigate these
                        allegations thoroughly on a most urgent basis.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador replied that the question was that U.S. military aircraft had
                        repeatedly violated Chinese air space and now had dropped bombs on civilian
                        structures and a merchant ship. This time it was more serious. They
                        earnestly hoped the U.S. would take effective measures to prevent a
                        recurrence so as not to affect the normalizing of relations between the two
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> indicated that he
                        recognized that these developments were much more serious although the U.S.
                        side also viewed the charges of intrusions into <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> air space with great seriousness. He specifically regretted
                        that there had been a report of damage to civilian structures and wanted to
                        reiterate <pb n="3" xml:id="d133-03" facs="d133-03"/>that such an occurrence
                        would be a grave violation of established practices and procedures. He
                        reiterated that these measures were being intensively reviewed and that
                        these new allegations would also be taken into account. The Ambassador could
                        expect a response within 48 hours.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> then asked the
                        Ambassador a question to clarify the time of the intrusions referred to in
                        the note, pointing out that the note indicated they had occurred shortly
                        after noon Washington time on June 9. This would be only a short period
                        after the incidents referred to in the note given to Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> on the previous day; the incidents
                        referred to in the latest note would have occurred before the U.S. side had
                        been made aware of the other allegations of intrusions on June 9. In any
                        case, the U.S. side would examine all of these allegations in the intensive
                        investigation which had begun. The Ambassador agreed that the incidents had
                        occurred close to 1:00 p.m. Washington time on June 9 since there was now a
                        12 hour time difference between Washington and Peking. The Ambassador stated
                        that he hoped the U.S. side would really take measures to stop recurrences
                        and then indicated that that was all he wished to say on that subject.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned to a more cordial conversation on
                        noncontroversial subjects such as differences and similarities in geography
                        and the American reaction to the Pandas. During this exchange the Ambassador
                        referred to the fact that Commander Howe would visit more of China and see
                        many other places that he had not yet seen in China as relations normalized.
                        During the discussion of geography, the Ambassador noted that the Chinese
                        think of the U.S. and China as the two arms of the world because they are on
                        opposite sides of the globe.</p>
                    <p>In answer to the Ambassador's question of the previous day concerning when
                        the U.S. might make a statement at Stockholm, Commander Howe indicated that
                        a mild U.S. statement would probably be made at the meeting on Monday. Mrs.
                        Shih noted she had seen something to this effect in the New York Times.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> then took his leave
                        indicating he wanted to ensure that the proper persons on the U.S. side were
                        immediately aware of what was in the Chinese note. The Ambassador apologized
                        for the personal inconvenience to Commander <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> and that he could not have a rest on Sunday but
                        remarked that these matters were serious. Commander Howe responded that the
                        U.S. side regarded them with equal seriousness, wanted to deal with them
                        immediately and it was not an inconvenience. These matters would be brought
                        immediately to the attention of the proper persons. Although Commander
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCJT1">Howe</persName> regretted the unhappy
                        circumstances that necessitated this meeting, he was personally always glad
                        to see the Ambassador and Mrs. Shih and he had enjoyed talking to them. The
                        Ambassador thanked Commander Howe for the sentiment and escorted him to the
                        elevator.</p>
                    <p>[Tab A]</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d133-04" facs="d133-04"/>
                    <p>On June 4 and 9, 1972, U.S. military aircraft successively intruded into
                        China's airspace over the area of Kwangsi Province, against which the
                        Chinese side has already lodged protests with the U.S. side. However, from
                        0056 to 0058 hours, June 10 (Peking time), U.S. military aircraft again
                        flagrantly intruded into China's airspace on two occasions in two sorties,
                        and in the second sortie, the area of Pinghsiang, Kwangsi Province, China,
                        was bombed. Earlier at 2112 hours, June 9 (Peking time), U.S. military
                        aircraft carried out bombing around a Chinese merchant ship “Hongqi No. 150”
                        anchored near the Hon La Island of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam. The
                        ship was harmed by bomb splinters, and the life and safety of our personnel
                        seriously menaced.</p>
                    <p>Recently while successively bombing north Viet Nam, the U.S. side has been
                        pressing up to China's borders, intruding into China's airspace, and even
                        going to the extent of bombing Chinese civilian structures and a Chinese
                        merchant ship. This has obviously menaced the security and freedom of
                        navigation of our country. The Chinese side hereby lodges a strong protest
                        with the U.S. side against this. The U.S. side should understand that the
                        Chinese side has to date exercised restraint, but such restraint cannot
                        possibly be unlimited. If the U.S. side does not take effective measures to
                        stop such actions, efforts towards the normalization of relations between
                        China and the United States will inevitably be affected.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>After my telephone discussion with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Sunday evening Washington time, I spoke to Mrs.
                        Shih and conveyed to her the message Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and I had discussed, emphasizing that we had just
                        instituted the strictest disciplinary controls and were also revising our
                        operating instructions to preclude any possibility of a repeat incident. I
                        pointed out that both Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        and the President had directed this action in view of the seriousness of the
                        reported incident and that the new restrictions and disciplinary controls
                        were being instituted prior to completion of an urgent investigation of the
                        matter so as to be sure that future incidents cannot occur. I pointed out
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was greatly
                        distressed by their report and that he wished to express his sincerest
                        regrets that an incident as that reported over Chinese territory could occur
                        (I carefully avoided inferring that the action we had taken or our apologies
                        were associated with the Chinese complaint about their merchant vessel.)
                        Mrs. Shih appeared very relieved at the promptness and character of our
                        response and I urged her to request that the Ambassador flash this oral
                        response immediately to Peking so that her government would be completely
                        aware of the seriousness with which our side viewed the reported incident
                        and of our determination to preclude such incidents in the future. I
                        informed her that we would provide a complete written explanation of all the
                        incidents reported to us when the urgent and detailed investigations now
                        underway were completed.</p>

                    <p>The meeting took place at our initiative in order to convey two written
                        messages, one (at Tab A) being a reply to several <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> notes on U.S. aircraft incidents, and the second (Tab B)
                        conveying further details on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s forthcoming visit to Peking.</p>
                    <p>I was greeted in the usual friendly fashion by Mrs. Shih and escorted to an
                        upstairs meeting room for several cups of green tea. After initial
                        conversation I handed over the two notes and added that I had some comments
                        to convey orally as well. She commented that she ought to read the messages,
                        which she then did, and I then told her the following:</p>
                    <p>“On the subject of the first note, on the aircraft incidents, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has asked me to say that you will
                        see a distinct change in the pattern of our operations in the immediate
                        future.</p>
                    <p>“On the subject of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                        forthcoming visit to Peking, he asked me to tell you that while in Tokyo he
                        informed the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, on a most
                        confidential basis, that he would be visiting Peking. He felt he had no
                        choice but to do this. Because after the announcement of the trip on
                        Wednesday [June 14] it probably will become public in the press that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> informed the Japanese
                        leaders, he asked me to inform you now that he did so.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih took this all down in her little notebook, and told me she would
                        convey this to the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>She served several more cups of tea. In the ensuing conversation she asked a
                        question or two about Tokyo (we stuck to personal impressions, <pb n="2" xml:id="d135-02" facs="d135-02"/>Tokyo city life, etc.). When she
                        commented that we would have only a few days to work on preparations for the
                        China trip, I assured her that the work had begun before we went to Tokyo
                        and that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would be fully
                        prepared for, and was looking forward to, his forthcoming visit.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. side wishes to provide urgent comments on the three notes that it
                        has recently received from the Chinese side concerning the activities of
                        U.S. aircraft.</p>
                    <p>A thorough investigation has been completed concerning the Chinese note on
                        possible intrusions of U.S. aircraft into the airspace of the People's
                        Republic of China on June 4, 1972. The investigation covered aircraft flight
                        paths, procedures followed, aircraft navigational equipment, flight
                        monitoring systems and other means used to ensure against inadvertent
                        intrusions. The investigation has been inconclusive. We confirm that U.S.
                        aircraft were flying near the border of the People's Republic of China at
                        the time. The inconclusive nature of the investigation may be due to
                        differences in radar characteristics or related factors. In order to avoid
                        the possibility of further accidental intrusions into Chinese airspace, the
                        U.S. has instituted new procedures to keep U.S. aircraft further away from
                        Chinese territory and thus eliminate the reoccurrence of these regrettable
                        incidents.</p>
                    <p>A thorough investigation has been launched on an urgent basis concerning the
                        alleged intrusion by U.S. aircraft into Chinese airspace on June 9,
                        1972.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the reported intrusion into Chinese airspace and the reported
                        accidental bombing of Chinese territory on June 10, 1972, the U.S. side
                        apologizes for this inexcusable incident. An urgent <pb n="2" xml:id="d136-02" facs="d136-02"/>investigation of the circumstances
                        surrounding the incident is underway. The U.S. side will take disciplinary
                        action against the personnel responsible for this flagrant violation,
                        however inadvertent, of strict standing orders.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side is investigating the allegation that U.S. military aircraft
                        caused damage to a Chinese merchant ship of June 9, 1972. While every
                        precaution will continue to be taken to avoid such incidents, it must be
                        pointed out that unloading operations within North Vietnamese territorial
                        waters do entail the risks of accidents.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> looks forward to
                        discussions of all important issues with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and other Chinese leaders. These
                        discussions will be conducted on the U.S. side with every intention to
                        pursue with energy and conviction the cause of normalizing Sino-U.S.
                        relations.</p>

                    <p>CINCPACAF HAS CONFIRMED THAT SEVENTH AIR FORCE HAD NO AIRCRAFT OPERATING

                        AND BOMBING.</p>
                    <p>SIX A-7 AIRCRAFT LAUNCHED FROM THE USS KITTY HAWK BETWEEN 100[unclear] AND
                        lOOO2H WITH THE MISSION OF STRIKING THE NORTHEAST RAIL ROUTE HIGHWAY 1A IN
                        THE AREA SHOWN ON THE MAP.</p>
                    <p>ALL AIRCRAFT RECEIVED A NAVIGATIONAL UPDATE AT POINT I WITH SYSTEMS
                        INDICATING LESS THAN ONE-HALF MILE ERROR AT THE UPDATE PO[unclear] <pb n="2" xml:id="d137-02" facs="d137-02"/>THE AIRCRAFT PROCEEDED TOWARD THEIR
                        TARGET AREA CROSSING THE COAST BETWEEN 4500-5000 FEET ON INSTRUMENTS. THEY
                        BROKE CLEAR OF THE WEATHER AFTER ABOUT 40 MILES, SHOWN BY THE BLACK ARC.</p>
                    <p>THE PILOTS REPORT THAT UPON BREAKING CLEAR, ROUTE 4 WAS VISIBLE AND THAT
                        THEIR NEXT CHECK POINT, THE INTERSECTION OF ROUTES 4 AND 13, WAS EASILY
                        RECOGNIZED, NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEMS WERE STILL GOOD WITH NO UPDATE REQUIRED,
                        FURTHER, LANG SON BECAME CLEARLY VISIBLE FROM APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES.</p>
                    <p>FOUR AIRCRAFT ARRIVED IN THE TARGET AREA BETWEEN 100047H AND 100058H AND
                        BEGAN ATTACKING MOVING VEHICLES WHICH INITIALLY HAD THEIR LIGHTS ON. THE
                        REMAINING TWO AIRCRAFT ARRIVED AT 0116H AND 0118H, AFTER THE TIME OF THE
                        ALLEGED VIOLATION. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FLIGHT DREW AAA FIRE PROBABLY FROM
                        MOBILE UNITS WITH THE CONVOYS FROM THE AREA INDICATED ON THE MAP. THROUGHOUT
                        THE ATTACK THE PILOTS REPORTED THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THE LINE OF
                        THE HIGHWAY. THE NORTHERNMOST TARGET ATTACKED IS INDICATED ON THE MAP AND IS
                        SOME 19 MILES SOUTH OF AREA OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d137-03" facs="d137-03"/>
                    <p>ONE MIG WAS REPORTED IN THE AREA FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. ITS LIGHTS WERE SEEN
                        BY TWO <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> PILOTS AT APPROXIMATELY 0110H. NSA
                        CONFIRM THAT ONE MIG TOOK OFF FROM PHUOC YEN AT O100H HEADED NORTH AND
                        RETURNED PRIOR TO 012011 WHEN A SECOND MIG TOOK OFF TO THE NORTH. THERE IS
                        NO EVIDENCE OF MORE THAN ONE MIG AIRBORNE AT ANY ONE TIME IN THE AREA OF
                        INTEREST.</p>
                    <p>THE INGRESS AND EGRESS OF ALL AIRCRAFT WAS MONITORED BY AN E-2 AIRCRAFT WHICH
                        ALSO CONFIRMED THEIR POSITION PRIOR TO CROSSING THE COAST ON THEIR INGRESS
                        ROUTES WHILE NOT HOLDING ALL AIRCRAFT CONTINUOUSLY, THE E-2 DID NOT OBSERVE
                        ANY BORDER VIOLATIONS AND, UPON REQUEST FROM THE TACTICAL AIR CONTROL CENTER
                        (RED CROWN) ABOARD THE USS LONG BEACH, RECALLED ALL AIRCRAFT FROM THE TARGET
                        AREAS THE TWO LATE ARRIVING AIRCRAFT COMPLETED THEIR STRIKES BEFORE HEADING
                        HOME.</p>
                    <p>SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS ARE OF NOTE IN THIS CASE. FIRST, THERE IS A MARKED
                        GEOGRAPHIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE LANG SON AND PING HSIANG AREAS;(*) WHILE
                        THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A PROBLEM, IT COULD ALSO BE USED BY THE CHICOMs IN AN
                        ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> AND CAUSE <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> TO CEASE <pb n="4" xml:id="d137-04" facs="d137-04"/>BOMBING IN THE LANG SON AREA. SECONDLY, THERE ARE NO
                        CONFIRMED FIXED AAA OR SAM SITES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA NOR WERE THERE ANY
                        REPORTED SAM FIRINGS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME IN QUESTION, MAKING IT DOUBTFUL
                        THAT A SAM IMPACTED NEAR PING HSIANG. AS MENTIONED, AT LEAST ONE MIG WAS
                        ACTIVE IN THE AREA, BUT THERE IS NO TRACK AVAILABLE AND NO EVIDENCE THAT A
                        MIG MAY HAVE JETTISONED FUEL TANKS NEAR PING HSIANG. THIRDLY, ALL WERE
                        EXPERIENCED PILOTS, CAREFULLY SELECTED FOR THE MISSION, FLYING
                        FULLY-SYSTEMS-CAPABLE AIRCRAFT UNDER EXCELLENT WEATHER AND VISIBILITY
                        CONDITIONS. LASTLY, A REVIEW OF ALL NAVAL TACTICAL DAT SYSTEM TAPES DOES NOT
                        REFLECT ANY TRACKS CROSSING THE BORDER.</p>
                    <p>(*) MOUNTAINS WOULD PRECLUDE AN ATTACK SOUTHWEST OF PING HSIANG</p>
                    <p>THE LAST RECONNAISSANCE MISSION WHICH MAY HAVE PROVIDED PHOTO COVERAGE OF THE
                        AREA OF INTEREST WAS GIANT SCALE NUMBER 504 ON THE NIGHT OF 13 JUNE. RESULTS
                        OF THIS PHOTOGRAPHY ARE BEING EXPLOITED AT THIS TIME.</p>
                    <p>AT THE PRESENT, THE POSSIBILITY OF <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ORDNANCE
                        BEING DROPPED IN CHINA IS CONSIDERED REMOTE AND ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE
                        A-7s DID IN FACT REMAIN IN NVN.</p>

                    <p>June 16, 1972</p>
                    <p>This memorandum is in response to the allegations that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft intruded into <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        airspace during the period 9-10 June 1972 and that splinters hit the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> merchant ship Hong Chi 150 (Hung Qu 150) in
                        the vicinity of Hon La Island as a result of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> combat action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> operational commanders were directed to
                        conduct a complete investigation of operations which could have generated
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> complaint. Our findings are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>A. 9 June 1972. Alleged Penetration of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        Airspace over the Ning Ming and Tunghsing areas.</p>
                    <p>(1) There were no <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy aircraft in the area
                        of the alleged intrusion. A total of [text not declassified] Air Force
                        aircraft (strike, escort, and reconnaissance) were operating southwest of
                        the alleged <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border violations.</p>
                    <p>(2) The strike and escort aircraft maintained their position visually and
                        with [text not declassified]. Other support aircraft, including those
                        involved in a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> engagement were also under
                        control of the USS LONG BEACH. The two RF-4C aircraft, escorted by F-4
                        aircraft, [text not declassified] but never approached closer than 3 nm to
                        the border.</p>
                    <p>(3) We have no reason to believe <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft
                        violated the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border. However, LONG BEACH
                        did have two plots on an unidentified aircraft, ten minutes apart, in the
                        Tunghsing area. <pb n="2" xml:id="d138-02" facs="d138-02"/>There were no
                        known <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft (including drones) in the
                        area at the time of these plots. Additionally, none of the aircraft
                        identified above are operated at a speed of 192 knots which is the speed
                        indicated by the time and distance factors resulting from the unidentified
                        LONG BEACH radar fixes.</p>
                    <p>B. 9 June 197.2 Allegation that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Bomb
                        Splinters struck the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ship HONG CHI 150
                        (Hong Qu 150) in the vicinity of Hon La Island (2 1/2 nm off-shore). (1) The
                        USS STODDERT engaged two waterborne logistic craft (WBLCS) near the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> merchant ship HONG CHI with the closest
                        shell impacting 1400 yards from the merchant ship.</p>
                    <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy aircraft also struck a WBLC and
                        barges approximately 1 nm from the merchant ship. Bomb hits were spotted by
                        the USS STODDERT and all impacted at least 1600 yards from the ship.</p>
                    <p>(3) Neither bombs, gun projectiles nor flares, (<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>) were observed to
                        impact near the Hung Chi. Therefore, it is considered unlikely that
                        splinters were thrown on the ship as alleged.</p>
                    <p>C. 10 June 1972. Allegations of intrusions of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> airspace in the area of Ping Hsiang and the bombing of
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> structures in a small village. (1)
                        The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Air Force had no aircraft north of 21
                        degrees north four hours before or after the alleged incident.</p>
                    <p>(2) The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy did launch six A-7 aircraft
                        for strikes along the northeast railroad and Route 1A near the border area
                        in question. However:</p>
                    <p>(a) All aircraft navigational systems were operational with less than
                        one-half mile error at the update point. The weather was clear in the target
                        area, Lang Son was visible from 20 miles, and the northernmost target which
                        was attacked was some 19 nm south of the area of the alleged incident. <pb n="3" xml:id="d138-03" facs="d138-03"/>(b) The ingress and egress of all
                        aircraft was monitored by an E-2 airborne early warning aircraft, and while
                        not tracing all aircraft continuously, the E-2 did monitor their progress.
                        No border violations were observed.</p>
                    <p>(c) All indications are that the A-7 aircraft did in fact remain in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and no ordnance was dropped by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>A thorough review of the reports submitted by the Air Force and Navy
                        commanders concerned, regarding the alleged intrusions of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> airspace and bombings, does not reveal
                        evidence to support such allegations. Major considerations evolving from
                        evaluation are:</p>
                    <p>A. Adverse weather was not a factor.</p>
                    <p>B. Ingress and egress routes and target areas were verified visually by
                        aircrews. Target operating areas were further verified, in part, by powt
                        strike photography.</p>
                    <p>C. Aircraft navigation systems, control procedures exercised by LONG BEACH
                        and the E-2 aircraft, and visual contact maintained between strike forces
                        and escort aircraft all verify that the operations were conducted within
                            <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> airspace and over international
                        waters.</p>
                    <p>D. Only experienced aircrews are selected for these important missions, and
                        the avoidance of border violations is stressed during aircrew briefings.
                        These efforts are specifically directed towards prevention of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> airspace incursions and strikes against
                        unauthorized or misidentified targets.</p>
                    <p>The seriousness and sensitivity of these allegations and complaints are well
                        recognized. Every effort has been and will continue to be made to avoid
                        inadvertent intrusion into the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> airspace
                        and to insure that ordnance is only delivered upon authorized targets.</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Guest House #5, Peking</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This was where it all
                        began.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: With the same
                        participants (<persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> and Pineau, the
                        stenographer).</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, Miss Pineau was not
                        on the first trip. I had no idea what we would find here when I came.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You are probably
                        familiar by now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, now. And now I
                        always look forward to it very much.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, it's almost
                        one year, I believe.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was accused in a New
                        York Times article of conducting a China-first policy two days ago.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Oh, is that true?
                        We haven't seen that editorial.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will give it to you.
                        I have a copy.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d139-02" facs="d139-02"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They say you
                        practice China First?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: China first, at the
                        expense of Japan.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That might not be
                        so because you also said some very nice things in Japan. For instance, you
                        told them you could now tell them you were coming to China this time and
                        therefore <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> were very happy because they could
                        say they had knowledge of that beforehand.</p>
                    <p>Vice Foreign Minister Ch'iao: There would be no more <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> “shocks.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There was no way I
                        could avoid telling them, being in Japan 48 hours before the announcement
                        was made. But we told all three—we told both <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>, so
                        nobody could claim any preference.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So which items
                        would you like to be discussed in the restricted meetings?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we can discuss in
                        the restricted meeting, if you want to, Vietnam or Indochina, Soviet
                        affairs, or a general assessment of the Soviet situation. Let me just see.
                        If you want to discuss anything about Taiwan, I would like to discuss it in
                        a restricted session, and one item about South Asia.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Japan?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Japan. We can do it in
                        one of two ways. Either in a restricted session or a slightly enlarged
                        session. I don't need to have every member of my group present at every
                        meeting, and I can control this. I won't ask you to arrange meetings unless
                        it is absolutely necessary. Would this be your format for a restricted
                        session, just this group?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That will depend
                        upon the specific conditions. The comparatively small scope would be those
                        present. For certain issues that might be related to larger scope, then we
                        would include more, not very many.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. I feel the same
                        way. And we can discuss that from case to case.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d139-03" facs="d139-03"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So how do you
                        think we should begin? You informed us beforehand you would like to talk to
                        us about your visit to the Soviet Union and your talks there. But that could
                        be long, do you think?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, that could be.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: What do you think
                        would be rather short? Japan?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, Japan would be
                        rather short. Probably. Probably Japan would be short. And probably I can
                        make one point about the Soviet aspect, because that would relate to what I
                        would like to have Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> discuss with his
                        colleagues. We will have a long discussion about the Soviet Union, but I
                        want to make one point.</p>
                    <p>It was clear to us one of the objective consequences of the Moscow summit was
                        to free Soviet policy for a greater role in Asia by producing relaxation in
                        Europe. We recognize that this is the Soviet strategy, but we cannot deal
                        with it in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You cannot deal
                        with the Soviet Union you mean?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, with what the
                        Soviet Union might do in Asia by maintaining tension in Europe, because our
                        allies would not agree to that. But as we decided last December, and in fact
                        proved, we will not support, in fact we will strongly and, if necessary,
                        violently, oppose Soviet adventures in Asia, and in particular pressures
                        that might be directed against the People's Republic. We do this in our
                        self-interest, not for any other reasons.</p>
                    <p>Now, this, however, makes it desirable that the links that are beginning to
                        develop gradually become somewhat more visible in the area that is being
                        discussed in Paris. And therefore we have asked ourselves how this could be
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Let me say right at the beginning in the field of trade, for example, we are
                        not interested in this for commercial reasons. The maximum trade we can
                        foresee is almost meaningless in terms of our gross national product. So our
                        interest in this respect is quite different from say, the <pb n="4" xml:id="d139-04" facs="d139-04"/>Japanese interest. We don't look at
                        China as a big market. But we are prepared to use it as a symbol of the
                        equality vis-a-vis the other countries with which we are prepared to trade
                        of the People's Republic, and for whatever use it can be in establishing
                        such links. The same is true in science, agriculture, technology, medicine,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>But in this respect I have one particular problem. The problem as I have
                        looked at the Paris channel is that at least in our government very many
                        projects have come up one at a time, and from our point of view become
                        unmanageable in relationship to any political objective. I don't know how it
                        is with you, but that's how it is with us. So we thought that if we could
                        create some commissions in various fields—some joint commissions say in
                        agriculture, economics and science—then we could give directives to our
                        members of these commissions in a general political sense rather than have
                        fifty projects a month that come to us and are very difficult to relate one
                        to another. And then the commission could sort out the individual
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>If this idea commends itself to you, then Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>,
                        Mr. Solomon and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> can
                        discuss the details with whomever you designate. But we are also prepared to
                        continue on this present basis. It seemed to us a more efficient way of
                        proceeding.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, that is
                        a bilateral matter.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That belongs to
                        the bilateral field.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly, but I wanted
                        to explain to you what our general strategy is, and why I am raising it with
                        you rather than leaving it entirely to the bilateral field. We are in no
                        particular hurry. It is simply growing out of our understanding of what the
                        strategy of some other countries may be.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The second point I
                        would like to ask is, has there been any progress made in the Paris talks
                        with the Vietnamese?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, at this moment the
                        Paris talks are suspended and there is no fixed date for the resumption. We
                        have proposed, and this is <pb n="5" xml:id="d139-05" facs="d139-05"/>confidential, we have proposed to the North Vietnamese that there be a
                        private meeting between <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName>
                        and me on June 28 and have stated that if there is such a meeting its
                        purpose would be to prepare for the resumption of plenary sessions. We have
                        not yet received a reply.</p>
                    <p>But the real problem, Mr. Prime Minister, is not whether the talks resume but
                        what we are going to talk about when they do resume. The tragedy is—as I
                        have told you before and I know we don't agree, but I have to be honest—the
                        North Vietnamese are very heroic but they are not wise. They are acting as
                        if Dulles were still alive and as if they had to protect themselves against
                        Dulles. There is no solution to this problem if they insist that everything
                        must be settled at once. If they could do what you have done—to separate
                        those issues which must be taken care of immediately from those which should
                        be settled by history, the war would be over in a month. Because we have no
                        permanent objectives in Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I also mentioned
                        Dulles to Fairbank. I admitted that I had made a mistake when I met with the
                        five American families that evening. I didn't have time to meet them
                        individually, so I had to put them together.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which families?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Fairbank, Cohen,
                        Stone, Salisbury and Dudman.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will hear from them,
                        Mr. Prime Minister, without any question when I come back to America.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You also mentioned
                        you would like to see Mr. Fairbank.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, for 15 minutes some
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Vice Foreign Minister Ch'iao: He is now in Peking. He is going to leave for
                        other places, but he is now in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If there's a free
                        half-hour.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d139-06" facs="d139-06"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: On the first day
                        Mr. Fairbank came he told Mr. Ch'iao he had met you before he came to China.
                        The core of his point was to get Chinese students to go to his research
                        center in Harvard.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He is a very
                        single-minded man. But, of course, he is also an old friend.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: This time I would
                        like to discuss this issue more with you, the issue of Vietnam. Because you
                        are always trying to compare them with us. This is a different thing. You
                        are a very practical statesman so you know the situation is different.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we will discuss it
                        any time the Prime Minister wishes.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But Podgorny on
                        his return to the Soviet Union from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said
                        he had suggested if the hostilities could stop…if a cease-fire could be
                        entered, together with the bombing and the blockade stopped…we don't know
                        whether that was something you discussed with the Soviet Union. Because he
                        said that openly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have not seen the
                        text of his statement. I can tell you what was discussed with the Soviet
                        Union. I cannot comment on what he said. If you have a text, I will be glad
                        to comment on it.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We also saw a few
                        press releases. Le Duc Tho passed through China the day before yesterday; I
                        also met him yesterday. I hadn't met Podgorny either. He might have met
                        him…Podgorny might have left after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName> went back. But we don't know. At that time <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> hadn't gotten news of Podgorny'
                        s statement. And, of course, I had neither the responsibility nor right to
                        discuss how they were going to proceed. But we assessed the situation
                        together.</p>
                    <p>So in the future when we have this specific topic of Vietnam I can say more
                        about that. Because if what Podgorny said had already been accepted by the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam then it seemed close to what you said. He
                        mentioned a ceasefire in place on the one hand, and on the other hand there
                        will also be a simultaneous cessation of bombing. But we will get the
                        English text.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d139-07" facs="d139-07"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What we discussed with
                        the Soviet leaders was an explanation of our May 8 proposal. And we secondly
                        discussed how, if the North Vietnamese insist that there also be a political
                        solution, how the May 8 proposal could be combined with the January 27
                        proposal, the eight points. We didn't discuss with the Soviet leaders a
                        separate ceasefire that did not involve prisoners. But a ceasefire that
                        included some arrangement for the prisoners we would be extremely interested
                        in discussing, and we would be very flexible in… we would not at all exclude
                        a ceasefire-in-place. (Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods.)</p>
                    <p>But we have not received any official information either from the Democratic
                        Republic of Vietnam or from the Soviet Union as to what was discussed in
                        Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>Interpreter: In Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We haven't
                        received any either.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But when we do discuss
                        Vietnam we should discuss it from the aspect that we are not looking for
                        excuses to extend the war and are not looking to inflict a military defeat
                        on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And beside the
                        question of Japan we would also like to discuss the issue of Korea.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I would only like
                        to ask you one thing. Do you not oppose China discussing with Japan the
                        normalization of Sino-Japanese relations?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I favor it.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, I saw from
                        the Japanese reports something to that effect. I would like to confirm
                        them.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d139-08" facs="d139-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I encouraged every
                        Japanese leader in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And also you, of
                        course, know we haven't had discussions with the Japanese government, but
                        with members of the ruling party, four Prime Ministers and ex-Foreign
                        Ministers. You met four ex- Foreign Ministers and I met three of them.
                        During each meeting we discussed the fact that normalization of relations
                        with Japan would not exclude any other power. And I also quoted the
                        Sino-U.S. communique that neither of us should seek hegemony in the Pacific
                        region and were opposed to any country or group of countries seeking
                        hegemony in that region.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We both have to show
                        restraint in dealing with Japan. If we were to compete in the short term I
                        think we would win politically, but that's not important. In the long term
                        it would lead to a new nationalistic trend in Japan. So we are encouraging
                        you in your normalizing relations with Japan. And you may have noted
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>'s comments in
                        Japan. He was there at the same time I was and I overshadowed his speech.
                        But he made a very good speech which said essentially the same thing. I will
                        send you a copy of his speech.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We only saw some
                        salient points. We haven't seen the text.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will send it to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: What was the main
                        theme?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That the U.S. has no
                        objection, and in fact welcomes, better relations between Japan and the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Is Mr. Reischauer
                        still opposed to you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but that will end
                        after the election.</p>
                    <p>Vice Foreign Minister Ch'iao: And he's still quarreling with Mr.
                        Fairbank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, much of this
                        intellectual community has suddenly discovered a great affection for Japan
                        which they believe we have neglected.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d139-09" facs="d139-09"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So you now have
                        made up for that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I think if you…
                        Well, I cannot follow the Japanese press and what the Japanese press says
                        bears very little relationship to what actually went on. In my conversations
                        I stuck to the basic themes of our understanding which is (1) that we have
                        no objection to normalization of relations between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, (2) that we are opposed to the nuclear
                        rearmament of Japan.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I read that, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>!</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Three, that we are
                        opposed to an overseas role for Japanese military forces.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I saw that
                        also.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Four, that the Japanese
                        military should confine themselves to the conventional defense of their home
                        islands.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I believe you
                        first mentioned that the U.S.-Japan Treaty was necessary.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, I said that, but
                        we have always said this to you.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But we have
                        noticed that there are some sections of the ruling party that do not agree
                        to that and their opinions are different from other sections of the ruling
                        party, and they wish to make some amendments to that treaty.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Particularly with
                        regard to Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As to the case
                        about Taiwan, that long ago shouldn't have existed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, there are two
                        issues. One with regard to the language in the communique of 1969, and the
                        other, if we wanted to defend Taiwan whether we could do so from Japanese
                        bases. What I said in Japan about the Security Treaty was that we will not
                        ask for its revision, but Japan is a big country now and it has every right
                        to ask for a revision if they want to, but they have to take the
                        initiative.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d139-10" facs="d139-10"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I heard that among
                        the mainstream sector of the Japanese ruling party there are some who would
                        like some amendment of the treaty at a certain time, not necessarily at the
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That could be, and when
                        that happens we will consider it. It is my belief that a Japan without the
                        Security Treaty will sooner or later rearm on a nationalist basis, maybe not
                        right away but eventually. It may rearm even with a Security Treaty so I
                        don't want to… because we are dealing here with a very volatile country
                            (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> nods). It seems to me that
                        the Japanese are torn by four different motives:</p>
                    <p>— an attraction toward the United States produced in part by their defeat,
                        and since they had never been defeated before they have to exalt the country
                        that defeated them; and financial considerations;</p>
                    <p>— Second, a sentimental historical attachment to China—a combination of love
                        and hatred;</p>
                    <p>— Thirdly, the Greater Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere toward Southeast Asia;
                        and</p>
                    <p>— Fourth, an attention toward Siberia now being encouraged by the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>And it is quite conceivable that when you meet them—not you because you're
                        too far-seeing—but China may hear only the pro-China side, and it may be
                        that we hear only the pro-America side, but I think all four exist
                        simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It seems that
                        there's a great difference between your balance of trade still.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right, about 3.
                        5 billion dollars, and that presents a problem. And the commercial practices
                        of the Japanese present another problem.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's a very
                        complicated world.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I think it's
                        important not to…I think that Japan has to be kept in some sort of emotional
                        balance, and anyone who is trying to push it too far in one direction may
                        easily bring about the opposite of what he wants.</p>

                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I still say that
                        Japan is at a crossroads, and it hasn't yet decided itself.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with the Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It's now in a
                        process of change.</p>
                    <p>So do you think we should end here today? We covered the general range today.
                        Tomorrow afternoon do you think we could try to discuss two topics—Vietnam,
                        the question of Indochina, and second, the question of U.S.-Soviet
                        relations? I would like first to hear your opinion of U.S.-Soviet
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. Could I add
                        one member to my group?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Perhaps we might
                        add Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName>, maybe others
                        depending on your side.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will let you know in
                        the morning. I will certainly have Mr. Negroponte for Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I think it is best
                        to begin with you on the question of U.S.-Soviet talks.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, it will just be
                        the two of us. And then I will turn over the bilateral matters to Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName>, Mr. Solomon and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>, and you might let me know whom
                        they should talk to.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: In the morning
                        perhaps you will all go out to visit… sight-see. We will try to arrange it.
                        So tonight you can get some early rest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Actually it's 6:00 in
                        the morning or later for us because of the time change.</p>

                    <p>1. OUR INITIAL RECEPTION HAS BEEN THE WARMEST OF ANY VISIT YET IN PERSONAL
                        TERMS. ALL OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BE
                        FRIENDLY.</p>

                        OUR MUTUAL INTEREST. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName> QUERIED ME
                        ON JAPAN TRIP, AND I REVIEWED MAJOR THEMES I SOUNDED THERE WHICH WERE
                        CONSISTENT WITH WHAT PRESIDENT TOLD <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName> WE WOULD TELL JAPANESE.</p>
                    <p>3. MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF MEETING WAS <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName>'S OBVIOUS EAGERNESS TO TALK ABOUT VIETNAM. HE NOTED
                        PODGORNY VISIT AND STATEMENT WONDERED WHAT TRANSPIRED AT MOSCOW SUMMIT AND

                    <p>4. THE SESSION WAS INCONCLUSIVE, LASTING LESS THAN AN HOUR DUE TO FATIGUE.
                        TONIGHTS INITIAL IMPRESSION, HOWEVER, WAS ONE OF CHINESE READINESS TO TALK
                        FRANKLY AND CONSTRUCTIVELY.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: Initial Report from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s Peking Trip</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Henry</persName> has flashed the following initial impressions
                        from Peking:</p>
                    <p>— Initial reception has been the warmest of any visit yet in personal
                        terms.</p>
                    <p>— Immediately after arrival, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName> visited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> at the Guest House. During the meeting, agenda was
                        discussed with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggesting
                        expanded bilateral exchanges. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        queried <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on the Japan trip
                        and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> emphasized that he had
                        remained totally consistent with what you told <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> would be given to the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> describes the most
                        interesting aspect of the meeting as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s obvious eagerness to talk about Vietnam. He
                        speculated with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> about the
                        Podgorny visit and expressed interest in what had happened at the Moscow
                        Summit, referring also to <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                        Tho</persName>'s recently completed visit in Peking. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> mentioned the idea of a cease-fire in
                        place which <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> evaded, pending
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s rundown of the Chinese
                        discussions with <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> which
                        were promised for the meeting the following day.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> described the initial
                        session as inconclusive, lasting less than an hour due to fatigue. However,
                        first impressions suggest that the Chinese are ready to talk frankly and
                        conclusively.</p>
                    <p>I will keep you apprised of all <persName>Henry</persName>'s reports as they
                        arrive here.</p>

                    <p>1. WE HAD FOUR PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName> THIS AFTERNOON ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SOVIET UNION AND
                        VIET NAM. I DID ALMOST ALL THE TALKING AS <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName> EXPRESSEDLY INVITED MY PRESENTATIONS AND CONFINED
                        HIMSELF TO CONSTRUCTIVE, NON-POLEMICAL QUESTIONS.</p>
                    <p>2. ON SOVIET UNION, I BRIEFED <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName>
                        ALONG FAMILIAR LINES ON OUR PURPOSES, ATTITUDES, AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
                        SINCE LAST JULY. HE ASKED SERIES OF QUESTIONS WHICH REFLECTED SOME CONCERN
                        ABOUT SOVIET INTENTIONS. HE SAID IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">MCGOVERN</persName> TO CUT DEFENSE BUDGET BY
                        ONE-THIRD AND LATER MADE A SCATHING REFERENCE TO PEOPLE WHO PROCEED OUT OF
                        NAIVE ILLUSIONS.</p>
                    <p>3. ON VIETNAM, I REVIEWED OUR POLICY, SLOWING OF NORTH VIETNAMESE OFFENSIVE
                        SOLIDARITY OF OUR DOMESTIC SUPPORT, PRESIDENT'S DETERMINATION AND
                        IMPOSSIBILITY OF OUR BETRAYING AN ALLY. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName> WAS MODERATE AND SHOWED MORE DIRECT INTEREST IN
                        NEGOTIATIONS THAN BEFORE. HE ONCE AGAIN FLOATED IDEA OF CEASE-FIRE-IN-PLACE.
                        HE SAID THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">MCGOVERN</persName> OR ANYONE ELSE TO OVERTHROW
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>, IMPLYING THAT NORTH
                        VIETNAMESE WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS FACT. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">CHOU</persName> MADE NO STATEMENT, PERHAPS WISHING TO PONDER MY REMARKS

                    </p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: Second Situation Report from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Peking</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Henry</persName> has just reported that he completed four private
                        meetings with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> on the afternoon of
                        June 20. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> did most of the
                        talking as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> expressly invited his
                        presentations and confined himself to constructive, non-polemical
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>— On Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> briefed
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> along familiar lines on U.S.
                        purposes, attitudes and policy developments since last July. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> asked questions which reflected some
                        concern about Soviet intentions.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made the point that it would be
                        impossible for <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName> to cut the
                        U.S. Defense budget by one-third and later made a scathing reference to
                        people who proceed out of naive illusions.</p>
                    <p>— On Vietnam, <persName>Henry</persName> reviewed our policy designed to slow
                        the North Vietnamese offensive, the fact of solidarity of our domestic
                        support, your determination and the impossibility of betraying an ally.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was moderate and showed more
                        interest in negotiations than ever before. He once again floated the idea of
                        a cease-fire in place. Most importantly, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said that it would probably be impossible for <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName> or anyone else to overthrow
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>, implying that North
                        Vietnamese would have to accept this fact (this coincides with the
                        intelligence report we had yesterday).</p>
                    <p>During the meetings, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made no
                        statements; <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> surmises he
                        wished to ponder the U.S. position before offering his own.</p>

                    <p>DATE, TIME, AND PLACE: Wednesday, June 21, 1972; 10:05 a.m.-12:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Guest House, Peking, People's Republic of China</p>
                    <p>After an initial exchange of pleasantries, Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>
                        opened by expressing gratification at the progress achieved since February
                        in the spirit of the Shanghai Communique, mentioning the U.S. tour by the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> table tennis team, the visit to
                        China by U.S. Senators Mansfield and Scott, and the imminent Congressional
                        visit. We thanked the Chinese for the hospitality shown American
                        representatives at the Canton Trade Fair.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had already given Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> our rationale as to why we believed
                        visible evidence of sustained momentum in exchanges and trade was in our
                        mutual interest. Hence he touched only lightly on the theme that we were
                        interested in this for international and domestic political reasons, not for
                        the intrinsic value of the trade. While we welcomed the latter, it would be
                        small relative to total U.S. foreign trade. <pb n="2" xml:id="d142-02" facs="d142-02"/>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                        chief interest was in the political and psychological significance of
                        exchanges and trade. We recognized that political and psychological factors
                        in turn were germane to the question of timing and pace. For our part, we
                        were prepared now for further forward motion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> said that we were flexible on mechanisms
                        which would advance exchanges and trade. This could entail formal
                        agreements, exchanges of letters, public announcements, or simply
                        implementation without announcement, inasmuch as developments would become
                        public. Visibility, however was important, because the American people had
                        to become accustomed to our new relationship if we were to be able to take
                        more fundamental steps in our relationship at some future time. Furthermore,
                        it was important before such time to have developed a mechanism whereby
                        these matters could be controlled via White House channels.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> developed the rationale for movement in such
                        areas as medicine and public health, scientific and technological
                        cooperation, cultural exchanges, and agricultural research. He spoke of the
                        possible utility of some form of bilateral commercial commission. He also
                        referred to the observation made by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> in February, 1972 that claims and
                        blocked assets were practical matters affecting the development of trade and
                        probably should be faced soon. These were complicated issues requiring
                        specialists; hence some mechanism to pursue these matters was needed,
                        whether in Paris, Peking, or partly in each city. <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        first needed to study the claims/assets problem, but promised to give it
                        early attention.</p>
                    <p>Charig expressed appreciation for both the substance and spirit of Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName>' presentation, which he found most
                        interesting and helpful. He assured Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> that
                        the Chinese side wanted gradual but steady movement. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was actively considering how to further
                        implement the Shanghai Communique. He said remaining political problems
                        prevented the use of certain types of mechanisms during our present stage of
                        transition. He touched politely, and once only, on America's “two Chinas”
                        problem. The Chinese were frankly groping for appropriate mechanisms during
                        the present transitional stage. Referring to the illustrative exchange
                        suggestions the U.S. side presented to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in October, 1971, <persName>Chang</persName> said that some
                        could be adopted in the near future; others would take longer. Exchanges in
                        physical culture and sports were easy. The Chinese were also actively
                        considering sending medical specialists and other scientists to the U.S.
                            <persName>Chang</persName> displayed particular interest in cancer
                        research.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d142-03" facs="d142-03"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> said all of these plans were welcome. He
                        concurred in the concept of “gradual and steady” progress, but reitereated
                        the importance of visibility. Referring to the transitional nature of our
                        relations, Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> said that continued momentum
                        could in turn be helpful in easing the political problems of that stage.
                        Development of appropriate mechanisms was also important, so that matters
                        would not “get off the track” as we proceeded down the course we had
                        mutually agreed upon. It was much better to prevent accidents than to have
                        to pick up the pieces after one had occurred.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Chang</persName> said their “private organizations” for
                        facilitating exchanges were “unified” and gave them no trouble. He invited
                        elaboration of our concern that problems could arise. Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> said we saw no particular problems on the
                        horizon now, but the nature of our diverse society was such that all sorts
                        of organizations and individuals wanted to get into the act. Some would not
                        have the experience or resources to follow through properly, and we could
                        not vouch for them. Broadly based institutions with experience and resources
                        could “prevent accidents” and more effectively accustom the American public
                        to dealing with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName> said that while formal
                        bilateral commissions or governmental agreements were not appropriate at
                        this stage, perhaps we could experiment with bilateral groups dealing with
                        specific problems or areas of mutual concern. Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName> expressed interest, but reminded him of the
                        problem of the ad hoc approach which we had discussed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CW2">Chang Wen-chin</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was interested in an exchange of scientific
                        information and materials, but Chinese publications were limited just now
                        which would limit reciprocity. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        publications would be increasing, but he hoped that in the meanwhile the
                        U.S. could provide some information of this sort “out of good will.” We
                        asked for an expression of specific areas of Chinese interest, which
                            <persName>Chang</persName> promised to supply.</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded on this point.</p>

                    <p>FROM: <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">AL HAIG</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: Report from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>I received a third progress report from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> covering his June 21 activities in Peking. It
                        contained the following highlights:</p>
                    <p>— He had just concluded a 3 1/2 hour session with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> which was devoted primarily to Vietnam, with some
                        discussion of the Soviet Union at the outset.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s distrust of the Russians was
                        again emphasized. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made the point
                        that disarmament was impossible with limitations in some fields but
                        increases in others the likely outcome.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> again strongly intimated the
                        need for the U.S. to keep its defenses up, even making favorable references
                        to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s testimny before
                        the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> displayed concern over our
                        extending credits to the Soviets since this might be the only way that the
                        strained Soviet economy could continue to fuel their arms buildup.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> reviewed Vietnam and made a
                        rather desultory defense of the North Vietnamese position. At the end, he
                        made the point that ontinuation of the war would not interfere in the
                        relaxation of relations between the U.S and the Peoples Republic of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also noted that there had
                        been a separate counterpart meeting during which there was a full exchange
                        of views on how to <pb n="3" xml:id="d143-03" facs="d143-03"/>promote
                        exchanges between our countries. <persName>Henry</persName> again commented
                        on the extraordinary lengths to which the Chinese are going to demonstrate
                        hospitality.</p>

                    <p>SUBJECT: Exchanges</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>, you
                        certainly gave us another treat this morning in the athletic event. Both the
                        physical layout of the plant and the performance were very impressive and
                        enjoyable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: What was most fascinating was the friendship
                        match between the Chinese and the Americans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Solomon: [in Chinese] We really lost face! (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I am not sure it made table tennis history,
                        but it was a good show.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d144-02" facs="d144-02"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: But it will be a chapter in Sino-American
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: From now on all people
                        who join <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>'s staff will
                        have to learn to play ping pong.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Solomon: Yes; I will soon be fired.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Starting with Mr.
                        Solomon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Do you have something to say?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Well, we led off yesterday; I wondered if
                        you care to start today.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Yesterday Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>
                        gave us a copy of a draft agreement and we have studied it, and read it in
                        detail. You have set forth many good ideas in agricultural research. As I
                        said yesterday, we think that at the present stage of our relations the
                        conditions are not yet right for the signing of such an agreement. The main
                        reason is that we are now working toward the direction [of fully normalized
                        relations], our two countries; we are just now doing that. So in view of the
                        present circumstances, and in view of what is provided in the Shanghai
                        Communique, the exchanges between our two countries in science and
                        technology and in other fields will be conducted on a non-governmental basis
                        with the governments providing assistance from the sideline. And in addition
                        to that, since the contacts between our two sides in science and technology
                        have just begun, we are still gaining experience in this area. So the
                        signing of a systematic agreement is premature. Our present attitude is that
                        we should leave your proposal for the time being. It would be best to create
                        the conditions for such an agreement.</p>
                    <p>As for your ideas set forth in the draft agreements in science, culture and
                        technology, we can work toward this direction. We can keep this in mind and
                        work at it constantly. At the present stage, according to the direction
                        provided by the Shanghai Communique, we can exchange delegations and
                        information and other materials and also increase our contacts.</p>
                    <p>During President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        China both President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> mentioned some
                        items on which we can have exchanges. And the United States Senate leaders
                        also mentioned some, and other visiting friends mentioned some items on
                        which we can have exchanges. The Chinese <pb n="3" xml:id="d144-03" facs="d144-03"/>Medical Society and other scientific institutions are
                        considering some of the items on which both sides can have exchanges. So we
                        are ready to receive more United States delegations or institutions or
                        friends who would like to visit our country.</p>
                    <p>Just take, for example, the Congressional leaders who will soon come. The
                        Institute for Foreign Affairs is preparing for their visit. As for the
                        doctors, we have mentioned this to the Society of Medicine. We would like to
                        welcome some cancer specialists from the U.S. Some of our nongovernmental
                        organizations are preparing to send delegations to the United States. Some
                        Chinese scientists are considering going to the United States. Of course not
                        to the United States alone—also to Europe at the same time. And it is going
                        to be a comprehensive delegation from several areas of science. To start
                        with, we think the delegation is not going to be very big.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the medical science delegation, we are going to send a delegation
                        to introduce Chinese experience in these fields and also learn from your
                        achievements. As for time and composition, we would like to hear your
                        opinions and what you have to say and comment on this.</p>
                    <p>And thirdly, about the journalists: we have heard that the American Society
                        of Newspaper Editors is going to send delegates to China; and we are also
                        considering sending a delegation to the U.S., but a time has not been fixed
                        yet.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly, there is going to be an acrobatics delegation going to the U.S. As
                        for the places they might perform, we hope that will be easy to arrange.
                        Since the number of members of the acrobatics troupe will not be as large as
                        the organized theatrical troupe, we think it might be easier to arrange for
                        theaters and so forth because the demands of the staging are not so
                        great.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Excuse me, I didn't understand. This
                        applies to acrobatics?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: We think that for the acrobatics troupe the
                        requirements are not as high as for theater or opera. It will be easier to
                        arrange. As for the time for them to go, we haven't decided. We would like
                        your comments.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, as for exchanges of information and data, we haven't anything to say
                        on this. If you have something to say we would like to hear your views on
                        this. And during the October visit Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> also set
                        forth many <pb n="4" xml:id="d144-04" facs="d144-04"/>specific items in
                        specific areas and we think all these areas are very detailed and perhaps it
                        would be better if during our visits the scientists of the two sides were to
                        exchange general views on these things. See how many of their ideas can be
                        materialized in such areas as environmental research or in chemistry, things
                        like that.</p>
                    <p>In principle we think exchanges in these areas can be conducted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Well, that's a very helpful presentation or
                        so it strikes me. Our handing over the illustrative agriculture paper was
                        primarily for its suggestive content; and as I indicated, we are very
                        flexible on the framework or mechanism involved, and we understand the types
                        of mechanisms which you consider appropriate for the near future. We are
                        very glad to hear, and we have understood, and this was our mutual thinking,
                        that these exchanges will go on and will be increased gradually. We
                        understand that they will not start in very large numbers or frequency, but
                        the areas which you have outlined as of more immediate interest sound very
                        agreeable to me at first view. We will want to talk further as to the
                        possibilities in some of these areas, but I think you are quite right in
                        saying that our specialists will at some point have to explore these fields
                        further. We will certainly welcome the people that you mentioned who are
                        considering coming to the United States. I don't know that we can give a
                        very definite reaction as to a suggested time. I think that can only really
                        be firmed up in correspondence through whatever means with the groups
                        involved. If you wish us to be of any help in that regard we, of course,
                        stand ready to be, but also it will be important for the institutions
                        involved to keep in touch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> mentioned yesterday the added assurance given
                        by a double track approach to this, emphasizing the non-governmental
                        approach but in line with the Shanghai Communique, but recognizing a certain
                        degree of government help and facilitation would be desirable. I would like
                        to suggest that there be a non-governmental point of contact or two for
                        exchanges which can be of general help, that is covering a fairly broad
                        field. I am thinking about a means of regularizing the management and
                        implementation of exchange progress which you have touched upon; and in the
                        facilitation of that suggestion there are at least two organizations with
                        the experience and resources to be helpful perhaps primarily behind the
                        scenes. They would not be in the forefront, but they can extend help on this
                        sort of thing. First is the Committee on Scholarly Communication of the
                        National Academy of Science, the Social Science Research Council, and the
                        American Council of Learned Societies. This group is qualified to facilitate
                        exchanges in the sciences and also quite a number of other scholarly
                        fields.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d144-05" facs="d144-05"/>
                    <p>Secondly, you have already had experience in connection with some help from
                        the National Committee on U.S.-Chinese relations. It is well qualified to
                        facilitate exchanges in the areas of cultural affairs and education. We
                        could simply maintain a degree of contact with these organizations through
                        the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in the Department of State,
                        to try to help make sure that things stay on the track.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Are these groups both in the National Academy
                        of Sciences?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: So all these three organizations are under
                        the Committee for Scholarly Communications?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Well, not formally as I understand it, but
                        they have joined together to form this committee. It isn't so much that they
                        are under it.</p>
                    <p>I don't want to slur over your comment on timing and composition. To the
                        extent we can we will be helpful here; but it occurs to us with regard to
                        American contacts of yours in the educational field they may wish to wait
                        until school reopens after the vacation period. On the other hand, they may
                        feel that would be a busier time and would prefer coming before school
                        opens. I think it would vary from school to school. So if you want us to be
                        helpful on this we will be, but direct communications would be fine too.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, with regard to the composition of the visiting groups, I am certain
                        that the American hosts would wish to be as accommodating as possible and
                        would be interested in your proposals and suggestions along that line.
                        Again, if you want us to be helpful in any way in that respect we will
                        certainly try to be. In any event, in view of our mutual concern that things
                        go right in this, the White House will want to maintain a very keen interest
                        in these matters and would like to follow them closely. But I am sure you
                        can rely, as in the past, on their discretion as to the manner in which that
                        is done. We all certainly believe that your suggestion on the acrobatics
                        visit would be extremely well-received by the American public, and I am
                        certain that insofar as facilities are concerned there would be no problem
                        with larger groups such as operas and things of that sort if you would like
                        to consider that also.</p>
                    <p>As to exchange of information and data, this is something which we will
                        definitely promise to look into further. It would perhaps be helpful if <pb n="6" xml:id="d144-06" facs="d144-06"/>you could indicate certain areas
                        of particular interest, because if the matter is left that general I think
                        it might leave us a little confused as to where to start.</p>
                    <p>Finally, with respect to the five areas which you mentioned, Mr.
                            <persName>Chang</persName>, which in principle are areas that you
                        believe we can move on earlier rather than later—that is the environmental
                        question, agricultural matters, meteorology, marine science and chemistry—we
                        welcome this indication of your views as to which of the two main categories
                        this might fall into. It is helpful to us in our own planning if we know the
                        areas we should next look toward having mutual discussions and planning on.
                        As you know, we gave ideas on these lines in the package we left last
                        October. So if you have any ideas in turn on these questions it would help
                        us to be prepared for movement in these areas when we find a suitable
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I believe there will be no problem in finding several sponsors for activities
                        in these areas and I assume that in our double-track approach that we can
                        also exchange views on this subject through Paris; or if you have any other
                        mechanism to suggest we are certainly ready to consider that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Thank you very much, Mr.
                            <persName>Jenkins</persName>, for your setting forth quite
                        comprehensively your ideas, and also your reaction on our position. We
                        understand that the United States side has adopted a flexible attitude
                        toward the problem of mechanisms. What you are concerned about is that such
                        exchanges will be going on smoothly and without any accidents. This is also
                        our desire. As for the specific mechanisms, we will also adopt a flexible
                        attitude and take a flexible form. So we think on this point both our sides
                        are agreed.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, in line with the Shanghai Communique, the exchange will be done on a
                        nongovernmental basis with the governments providing the conveniences to
                        assure that the exchanges will be carried out well. Of course in the case of
                        such contacts and exchanges the governments of our two sides can keep each
                        other well informed and exchange views for them to refer to so they can
                        consider their problems more carefully to assure that such exchanges will go
                        on well.</p>
                    <p>As for these private non-governmental institutions which are going to send
                        delegates to the United States, we think we can keep each other well
                        informed either through Paris or the other forums. We will inform the White
                        House of our plans so we can coordinate well.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d144-07" facs="d144-07"/>
                    <p>As for the U.S. delegates, for these more important ones we will also inform
                        the United States side and on such basis we can exchange views and let each
                        other know our suggestions. And these suggestions will also be for the
                        reference of the institutions concerned. As for the organizations we have
                        mentioned—some organizations in science and technology and also the National
                        Committee on U.S.-China Relations that you mentioned—they may play some role
                        from behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>We have taken note of such organizations; and actually, when the Chinese
                        table tennis team visited the United States, we got help from the National
                        Committee on U.S.-China Relations so we think they did play a helpful role
                        in our visit. So we will surely tell the related organizations that the two
                        organizations you have mentioned can grant assistance from the sideline, and
                        as for the specific items and organizations we will see when it comes to
                        concrete areas so we will know whether we can have direct or indirect
                        contacts with these organizations you have mentioned.</p>
                    <p>As for the Cultural and Educational Bureau of the State Department which you
                        mentioned, it will also grant assistance from the sideline. We welcome this
                        because we think the two governments really should give encouragement and
                        assistance to the non-governmental institutions; and actually our discussion
                        here is being carried on with this purpose.</p>
                    <p>Some specific points that just now we mentioned regarding sending some
                        delegates to visit the United States. Of course this has not yet been
                        finalized; it is not yet finally decided. We have told you about this just
                        to let you know, and we would like to listen to your views on this. We know
                        it is difficult for you to make a comment as to composition, timing and so
                        forth. So we think as long as we are following a two-track approach these
                        related organizations will contact your private groups, but we will also
                        maintain contact through our Paris channel. And we know the U.S.
                        organizations will give a warm welcome and such visits will be successful.
                        But as we are in a period of exploration to start with our delegations will
                        be quite small; but we just want to establish contacts. And besides, you
                        don't have to throw in a large number of people for reception. Afterward we
                        can send more people to your country. We think this might be more
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>We've also looked at and listened to your views as to how to make the visits
                        more effective and successful. Certainly we have no doubts that you are
                        ready to receive such delegations and will give them a warm reception. At
                        any rate, we will let you know through the Paris channel of the plans for
                        this. The same applies to the other artistic troupes. To start with we will
                            <pb n="8" xml:id="d144-08" facs="d144-08"/>send smaller delegations. In
                        this way it is more convenient to make arrangements. We think it is the same
                        in Europe, and it is rather difficult to make last minute changes in such
                        things. Besides, our actors and actresses haven't had much experience in
                        traveling abroad and may find it difficult to adjust at first. So we will
                        first of all send smaller groups and then bigger ones later. We think this
                        is better and we have no doubt you will also give them very good
                        receptions.</p>
                    <p>As for the exchanges of information and data, you have just now put forward a
                        very good suggestion and it is true we should let you know more specifics.
                        You have a great amount of information and data and we have very little. So
                        if you send us all your information [at one time] we can't digest it all. So
                        it is better if we let you know what our interests are in more detail.</p>
                    <p>As for the five areas I mentioned, I am just raising them to illustrate my
                        point. It doesn't mean that our exchanges will be limited to these five
                        areas or that exchanges in these five areas will begin right away. But we
                        think we can have exchanges in these areas. But these are just the
                        principles we need to make further study in these areas. We have contacted
                        the related institutions and they think it is all right to have contact on
                        these items. And it is true that as early as last October you put forward
                        your proposals in these areas, but at that time we were concentrating our
                        efforts on other issues and on preparing for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, so we were still waiting. But now we
                        are ready to consider these exchanges. We will let you know our concrete
                        proposals later on after consulting with the related institutions.</p>
                    <p>So generally speaking, we think that we have had very good discussions and
                        fruitful ones; but as to how to concretize this subject, it is necessary for
                        us to hold discussions with the related organizations on how to implement
                        and carry them out. So we will let you know later through the Paris channel.
                        And after learning what we have in mind, perhaps you would like to make
                        other suggestions and if afterward you have a thought about this or you want
                        to make suggestions, please let us know through the Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>There is another specific problem we would like to put forward to see if the
                        United States Government will help us. Around the time when the President
                        came to China for a visit we built and established a ground satellite
                        station in Shanghai from the RCA Corporation. In the course of that we had
                        contacts with the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium. We
                        hired from them the satellite channels, and General Thompson also came to
                        China. He was of great assistance on this process. <pb n="9" xml:id="d144-09" facs="d144-09"/>He is the Vice President of Operations
                        of that Consortium. The Peking Telecommunications Bureau hired that channel
                        and the channel proves to be very effective for communications between China
                        and the United States. It has been rather highly effective.</p>
                    <p>And we learned that Taiwan had also established contacts with that
                        Consortium. They also set up a ground satellite station in Taipei. As for
                        this point, we think it is hardly avoidable. But here is a specific problem.
                        The International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium has published a
                        guide to the operation of the satellite system and satellite working plan.
                        In these plans and guide - in the appendix—is published all the names of
                        countries which have set up stations. It is entered in the listing this way:
                        For the Shanghai station, they put “People's Republic of China (Shanghai)”;
                        and for the Taipei station they put “Republic of China (Taipei). So we think
                        such a list is not acceptable to us. In the same list there appear both the
                        “People's Republic of China” and the “Republic of China” and naturally the
                        situation of the two Chinas appears. So we are sure that the United States
                        side is very clear about our position on this subject; we don't have to go
                        into details on that. Since we didn't want to embarrass the International
                        Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, the Peking Telecommunications
                        Bureau put forward a suggestion to them—they suggested the listing appear
                        this way: “China (Shanghai) “ and “China (Taipei),” so as to avoid the
                        problem of two Chinas. It will mean no loss to the Consortium and it will
                        avoid the difficulties. So the Peking Telecommunications Bureau cabled to
                        General Thompson and asked him to ask the Consortium to change the list. We
                        should say that General Thompson has been very enthusiastic in helping to
                        set up the Chinese ground station and cooperative in this field. He
                        expressed his desire to come again and we will welcome him to come to China
                        again so we can explore this field together. Since we contacted General
                        Thompson on the change of lists by cable, it was impossible to make the
                        point very clear; and since General Thompson is a technical expert,
                        political problems seem not to be in his line. From his return cable it
                        seems he doesn't quite understand the significance of this problem and
                        doesn't follow our concern on this problem. So we will cable General
                        Thompson again urging him to make further efforts. We would like to take
                        this opportunity to raise this question with the United States Government of
                        whether the United States Government can use its influence to settle this
                        question. We think this is a minor problem, but politically it is of great
                        significance. So we think the United States Government might help us to
                        overcome this difficulty. So I think it is not so necessary to make further
                        explanation, and the United States Government will understand this point
                        because this is politically of great significance for keeping <pb n="10" xml:id="d144-10" facs="d144-10"/>this channel free of any barriers
                        between us. Will you please consider this problem?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Let me ask one
                        question. When you say this is of great importance and significance in
                        conducting our relations—keeping this channel without any barriers—do you
                        mean this physical channel?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Yes, the physical channel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: Using Intelsat to
                        communicate?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We certainly understand your position on
                        the problem, and I appreciate the manner in which you have presented it. We
                        will give it consideration and we would like to avoid embarrassment where
                        possible. But we will have to be in touch with you on this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I understand that these five areas were
                        illustrative, but that they seem to bear perhaps more promise for the near
                        future than some of the other areas and that is helpful for us to know. I do
                        not know whether you find it possible to give us any better idea now as to
                        the time when you are thinking of moving on any of this. If not, then
                        perhaps we will be hearing on that from the Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: It is difficult for us to give you a time on
                        these specific items now, but after our study perhaps we can let you know
                        some time later.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Certainly. Now, likewise, we would welcome
                        any indication from you as to any problems or ideas you have with regard to
                        either the timing or composition of prospective groups from the United
                        States. More than one of our symphony orchestras have expressed an interest
                        in coming to China. I think that would actually be a nice presentation. They
                        can make an interesting and brilliant performance, but it does involve a
                        large number of people. So if you want to get any ideas across to us on
                        timing or composition, I hope you will feel free to do that, and if we can
                        help you in any way you can contact us through the Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: As for the timing of the visit to China of
                        the U.S. science and technology delegation, we think whatever time they want
                        to come is <pb n="11" xml:id="d144-11" facs="d144-11"/>all right. But as for
                        our scientific delegation which is going to visit the United States, we will
                        try to send them as early as possible, but the earliest time will be summer
                        vacation. Perhaps it won't do even in July or August because they have to do
                        some preparatory work. We would like to know whether it is better for them
                        to go after summer vacation. As for the acrobatics troupe, we are thinking
                        of sending them later. Our tentative idea is to send them in the winter. As
                        for a U.S. symphony orchestra, it would be better for them to come later,
                        for it is more complicated than the scientific delegation. As for the
                        journalist visit, the timing is not important; but some of our [American]
                        journalists friends suggested they could come during your election period to
                        learn more about political life. But I doubt whether this is the best time
                        for them to go because our American friends will be kept busy. And others
                        might speculate about the reason for them to go then. So I doubt this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Well, that's very considerate of you to
                        bear that in mind. I think there are mixed considerations involved there,
                        and I think we can have further communication on it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: We can go into the
                        scientific and technical delegation visit through the Paris channel very
                        quickly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: As to vacations, I don't think you have to
                        assume that is a hurdle in any specific instance. We are not like the
                        French; we don't all go away in August. In fact many universities are on the
                        quarter system and their summer program is comparable to the other quarters;
                        and the professors take their vacations in the other three quarters, not in
                        the summer. So I think this is something you would want to look into in this
                        specific instance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Any other point to make? If not, shall we
                        stop here? I think our discussion has been helpful today.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: I certainly agree; very helpful. We can
                        take comfort that we seem to be thinking as nearly parallel as we are in the
                        next step to be taken. I would like to ask if you think it might be wise for
                        us to agree to look into, fairly soon, this matter of claims and blocked
                        accounts. It could produce problems as our trade grows. It could throw some
                        commodities into question; someone who has a claim could take it into the
                        courts. I think this is something our experts ought to get together on
                        because it does offer the possibility of an embarrassing incident which we
                        as a government would be unable to manage because of the courts. You know
                        the structure of our courts; there is nothing we can do there. We would like
                        to avoid embarrassment at this early stage in our trade relations. We <pb n="12" xml:id="d144-12" facs="d144-12"/>would like to reach agreement,
                        however informally, as to the possibility of our experts getting together in
                        Paris or Peking, or anywhere, just to explore the issue to be sure our
                        experts understand the pitfalls and explore the possibilities of getting it
                        cleared up. This is not unrelated to our considering Most Favored Nation
                        treatment in principle. Here I am speaking of the private claims as related
                        to the blocked Chinese accounts, because it is this that could cause trouble
                        with something being thrown into the courts involving commodities and
                        claims. The government claims get us into difficult private questions, and
                        we might mutually want to postpone this aspect of the problem for a while;
                        but the most immediate pitfalls involve these private claims and blocked
                        accounts. But the blocked Chinese accounts are linked to the private claims
                        aspect, so that we would envision as a part of this more immediate problem a
                        joint solution if you are agreeable to it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: I quite understand why you put forward this
                        question, because when we discuss the trade problem this claim problem might
                        crop up and it might create an embarrassing situation. But this is quite a
                        specific question, and I haven't had any detailed study on this question
                        because this is quite a complicated one. And as you know, there is the
                        question of the different systems of our countries against a certain
                        historical background which involves the different laws. We think the
                        American claims question is related to the Taiwan problem. It is very
                        difficult to distinguish which claim belongs to our country and which
                        belongs to Taiwan. There might be a claim for something which you think
                        belongs to Taiwan, but actually it belongs to us. It is difficult to sort
                        them out. At least we must ourselves make clear where the problem lies. Only
                        after studying can we say whether there are conditions for the experts to
                        meet and discuss this question. And if there is going to be a meeting
                        between the experts then there is a problem of how—on a governmental basis
                        or on a private basis. So all these questions need to be discussed. We will
                        further study this question and let you know our tentative idea
                        afterward.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: Fine. We would appreciate your giving early
                        attention to it at your convenience, because we want to avoid possible
                        embarrassment here. We are all laymen in these matters, but I am told by our
                        experts they believe the particular problem which could affect our trade can
                        be dealt with short of getting into the more troubling political aspects
                        concerning, for instance, government property and that sort of thing which
                        doubtless we will have to wait on a little while. But I think we might find
                        it helpful and worthwhile to solve the private claims issue in view of our
                        beginning trade.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: This has been, I think, very helpful
                        indeed; and we appreciate the opportunity to go into these matters. And we
                        will look forward to the use of the channels we have.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: Thank you very much for spending so much time
                        discussing these matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>: We certainly appreciate it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>: So shall we stop here since we have been told
                        we are going to have a picnic at the lake?</p>

                    <p>PLACE: Boat on Lake at Summer Palace, Peking</p>
                    <p>(The talks on the boat consisted of small talk about the surrounding scene,
                        etc. interlaced with substantive and semi-substantive conversation. Points
                        of substantive interest follow, with the small talk omitted.)</p>
                    <p>* * *</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's [Camp
                            <persName>David</persName>] much simpler than the dacha of the Soviet
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And it's not
                        possible for correspondents to go there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Impossible. It's the
                        one place they cannot follow the President. That's why if your Vice Foreign
                        Minister ever wants to get away from New York we can take him up there and
                        no one can follow him. That is, only if he doesn't concentrate his torment
                        on us.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: How far is it—Camp
                            <persName>David</persName>—from New York?</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d145-02" facs="d145-02"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: By helicopter—we
                        usually go by helicopter—half an hour. About 80 kilometers.</p>
                    <p>* * *</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: (pointing to
                        hillside) This was the earth that came out of the lake.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The mountain?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They dug the lake
                        and piled the dirt into a hill. The Dowager Empress had that done. And she
                        used more than half of the navy budget to build this summer palace.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's a good way to get
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And finally in
                        1894 she was defeated in war and in that way Taiwan and China were divided
                        for the first time. But there also was a good point because that defeat also
                        gave rise to the Chinese peoples' awakening. Otherwise, the Chinese empire
                        was so proud and arrogant that it thought it could do anything and no one
                        could do anything to her. Even the Chinese people at that time were not
                        thoroughly awakened, so that proves the point you just now mentioned that
                        one cannot be tempered without being defeated in battle.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, without suffering
                        in battle. Suffering is enough—not defeat. I just wanted to be sure the
                        Prime Minister in his usual thoughtfulness didn't overarrange this for
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But it was true
                        that China was defeated in that war.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: During the second
                        war we suffered, that was during the Russo-Japanese war. The two foreign
                        countries were fighting on Chinese land and that time we suffered.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In Port Arthur,
                        yes.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d145-03" facs="d145-03"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, and in
                        between was the invasion of the eight powers, including the United States,
                        of course, but it was led by a German general.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And I was just going to
                        say the German empire was particularly expansionist. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: All the colonial
                        countries joined in that invasion actually. Even Portugal gained a morsel
                        and Spain, Holland, and Belgium, Austria…</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Austria too?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, and they had
                        a concession in Tientsin.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d145-04" facs="d145-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But it was amazing that
                        China, weakened as it was, pursued its independence.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, on the
                        one hand it was because of the strong desire for unity. On the other, so
                        many countries were trying to get something out of China, other countries
                        couldn't control it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But they might have
                        divided it up. Your diplomats very skillfully played them off against each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: There were
                        contradictions among them. But on the other hand, China was not like the
                        former Africa that was carved up like a melon. What happened in China was
                        the division of spheres of influence. That's why we have an Anti-Imperialist
                        Road in China. It used to be called Legation Street. That was a funny name.
                        Just south of Trinamen Square. It used to be a very privileged area, with
                        embassies and foreigners who had privileges; and the Chinese there were
                        submitted to everything. There is a hospital now called the Peking Hospital
                        that used to be a German hospital. But it was not a place people would go
                        for treatment. It was a place where foreign officials went to play cards and
                        smoke opium.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When did it become a
                        hospital?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It was always
                        called a hospital.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But it wasn't used, was
                        it?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They used it to
                        cover up their nefarious deeds. And the street that leads to the Soviet
                        Embassy, during the Cultural Revolution the name of the street was changed
                        into Anti-Revisionist Road. And there was a ceremony to celebrate the
                        changing of the name, a ceremony that lasted ten days and a lot of people
                        participated.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what—two
                        million?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Maybe. (Laughter)
                        But it was very orderly. Something might have happened, but nothing
                        happened. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution it was very orderly.
                        All the students and youths were very orderly. Later on, because of the bad
                        elements, there was a period of confusion. So you know…if things get out of
                        hand…</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It's very difficult to
                        keep a revolution in balance.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And you have to go
                        through many twists and turns, but the good thing is the bad elements get
                        exposed or drop out of their own accord.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was always very
                        interested in the study of revolution, and tried to study it, but I don't
                        know of any other revolution that was led by the government against its
                        bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Against its
                        bureaucracy, and the people in authority taking the capitalist road, and
                        revisionists. You don't have time now, but maybe after the election you can
                        get a vacation from your job and come here, and we will talk about these
                        things and you can bring two stenographers.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After the election
                        actually would be a good time to have more talks.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, that will
                        depend on your efforts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the election?</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Including that…I
                        had a double meaning. One is that you should make your efforts to get your
                        President re-elected. The <pb n="5" xml:id="d145-05" facs="d145-05"/>second
                        is your efforts to normalize relations between China and the United States.
                        Because if you consistently refuse to normalize relations and then if I
                        follow you at the Palace, the masses will be cursing me—they won't applaud
                        me when I come if that happens. You understand, of course, the sentiments of
                        the people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, yes, but I think we
                        are making major efforts to normalize relations.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, but they
                        haven't been enough yet.</p>
                    <p>[Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> then switched the
                        discussion to the scenery there and in Hangchow.]</p>
                    <p>* * *</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They [newsmen] have one
                        story that I went straight to the Great Hall of the People and spent three
                        hours with you.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And also that
                        there were quite a number of Red Flag limousines.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know the Soviet
                        Ambassador is probably sitting in my waiting room now.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He will probably
                        pay a call on you when you return.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The only question is
                        whether he will be in my office when I return. And if I tell him that there
                        weren't that many meetings, and no meetings in the middle of the night, he
                        will know there is some devilish plot.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, probably so,
                        and if you tell him you got a good chance to get some sound sleep, he
                        probably won't believe you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He'd never believe it.
                        I had better confirm everything he's heard.</p>
                    <p>* * *</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d145-06" facs="d145-06"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't envy anybody in
                        China who is trying to get information you don't want him to have, and this
                        applies to ambassadors also. Sometimes we see reports that ambassadors
                        stationed here write, and they are fantastic.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: They probably can
                        only do some guesswork and then talk to each other about things that might
                        only exist in their minds.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And they take in
                        each other's information.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If I don't appear for a
                        few days they start guessing.</p>

                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Thursday, June 22, 1972, 11:03 p.m.-12:55 a.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: Government Guest House #5, Peking</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We will not stay
                        up all night like October.</p>
                    <p>All this time we have had a discussion on various aspects of various matters.
                        On some of the questions we discussed our views approximate. But a
                        relatively important question is still the question of Vietnam and
                        Indochina. I would first like to discuss some other matters before going
                        back to the Vietnam problem.</p>
                    <p>Your President made an estimate of the Sino-U.S. summit talks as well as the
                        U.S.-Soviet summit talks. That is in the article written by your President
                        which I mentioned this afternoon. And I hope that when you go back to
                        Washington you will report to your President that point on which I showed
                        concern today.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can be certain.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: At the same time I can inform
                        you that as for the Sino-Soviet talks, they are also up to some maneuvers.
                        There is a question of a triangle. We don't look at it that way, but the
                        Japanese like to look at <pb n="2" xml:id="d146-02" facs="d146-02"/>things
                        that way. The Soviet Union makes out there have been Sino-U.S. talks and
                        there have been U.S.-Soviet talks being dragged out. But the Sino-Soviet
                        talks arise out of a different set of circumstances, a different set of
                        provocations. If we say the Soviet Union first created tension over the
                        Berlin question in the West and the Czechoslovakia question; and the Romania
                        and Yugoslav questions, they have not succeeded in that yet, then in the
                        East it was the question of the Chempao Island incident. That I discussed
                        with your President in the Villa 18.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I remember that.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Three years and more have
                        passed now, and on the 11th of September of that year (1969) the Prime
                        Ministers of the two countries agreed on a provisional arrangement. But even
                        now these provisional arrangements have not formally turned into an
                        agreement. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> negotiated with
                        us for eight months in Peking—then he went back and another Deputy Foreign
                        Minister came in his place. But when <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> went to India, he solved the problems with India
                        in one week. So we can see the difference in nature between the Sino-Soviet
                        and Soviet-Indian questions.</p>
                    <p>Since the Soviet side changed their Vice Foreign Ministers, we too changed
                        ours. We didn't have as many but we changed too, and we liberated Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>. And the new head of our
                        delegation is Mr. Yu <persName>Chang</persName>. But this change of the
                        heads of the delegation may also have led to some miscalculations on their
                        part. Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> in 1963 was also a member of our
                        delegation discussing the boundary with them. And the Soviet Union has been
                        putting out feelers several times saying the two Prime Ministers may meet
                        once again. And the General Secretary will meet with us anytime and any
                        place. But we say when the two sides cannot arrange an agreement or even a
                        temporary agreement, how can there be talk between the two leaders?</p>
                    <p>We said let us first all agree on provisional agreements. That should be easy
                        according to your experience. But for us it is exactly the opposite. We
                        don't know when we will be able to reach an agreement with more of these
                        provisional arrangements. If you don't come this year, but come next year,
                        even then there will be no agreement. There's a saying in China that a fair
                        price on the market differs from morning to the night. So there is not much
                        to their feelers.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d146-03" facs="d146-03"/>
                    <p>And so with respect to the U.S.-Soviet talks we had estimated long ago, and
                        have told you estimated, you will be able to have results quickly.
                        Negotiations would be coming quickly, and would achieve results. And on the
                        other hand, after the reaching of various agreements between the United
                        States and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union wants to indicate it wants to
                        speed up their talks with us in form, but in substance it will be slow.
                        Because there is no question. It is only a question of the boundary, and as
                        for the boundary question they are well aware we have no territorial
                        ambitions. Yet they keep on saying we do and no matter what we say they say
                        we do.</p>
                    <p>Just like the Indians. As I told you this afternoon, India too is putting out
                        feelers for contacts with us. As for the question of contact, it is not
                        something we cannot do. But until Pakistan is firm, and because of its
                        problems, it would not be advantageous to Pakistan if we were to contact the
                        Indians. Because our situation with India is not the same as yours because
                        you have a certain position with India and there is the question of Bangla
                        Desh. As for our recognition of the so-called Bangla Desh, it can take place
                        only after all Indian forces have withdrawn from Bangla Desh and the
                        Pakistani territory they occupy, and only after a peace agreement has been
                        reached, and after Pakistan herself has recognized Bangla Desh. And even
                        then we will see. We need to be in no hurry.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't look for it
                        then under these conditions.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: No, it won't happen this year.
                        But there is an advantage in your recognition. So in this sense the reaching
                        of an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. They too can
                        discuss borders. It is advantageous to have some relaxation in the situation
                        and can make the Europeans feel more at ease. But there is still the
                        question of the Middle East which it will be difficult until the situation
                        is relaxed there. We can only just leave it there. Isn't that so? I know you
                        aren't looking after Middle Eastern affairs,</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, the Soviet Union
                        has at one time indicated some interest to discuss the Middle East with us
                        at the Presidential level, but then the matter has not progressed.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d146-04" facs="d146-04"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes. And as we saw it from
                        your joint communique and your visit to the Soviet Union this time, you are
                        just putting it on the sidelines for the time being.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think this is
                        essentially correct. There may be some discussions later this year, and if
                        there are we will keep you informed. Our impression is the Soviet Union
                        would like to have the situation quieted down in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Hmmmm. But is it possible to
                        have the situation quieted down?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It hasn't proved to be
                        possible in the last three years.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: At least it is different from
                        Indochina because there is a war going on in Indochina whereas there [Middle
                        East] there are just small clashes now and again. So the question remaining
                        is still the Vietnamese question. And on this question we have also long
                        been of the opinion that we differ even with regard to various concepts. If
                        we proceed from our concept, you would leave and let the Vietnamese people
                        solve their own problem themselves and no one will interfere with any
                        outside forces that would be, as Ho <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Chi
                            Minh</persName> had said, that you would be given a sendoff on a red
                        carpet. Otherwise, what will happen will still be war. But in these
                        circumstances, without outside interference, they will be fighting with
                        their doors closed. That is our thinking.</p>
                    <p>That's like what I said to you this evening about the Chinese Civil War. How
                        can we impose our thinking upon them? So we could only admit that we were
                        mistaken in signing the 1954 Geneva Agreements, that we were taken in by
                        Dulles at that time. And what is more, Vietnam being such a small country,
                        how can we want them to copy from us? That would be imposing upon them.</p>
                    <p>You know, after the Japanese surrender, on the surface we did have a period
                        of ceasefire with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>;
                        after we signed the peace agreement with them there was a ceasefire on the
                        surface for half a year. At that time <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> was the representative of all China. We were only a
                        region of China. But we had the courage to sign the ceasefire agreement and
                        when we signed we were confident <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> would break up the agreement <pb n="5" xml:id="d146-05" facs="d146-05"/>and we were aware when he did tear up
                        the agreement he had been wrong. So, as you see, in the White Paper of
                        Acheson they too expressed disagreement with it, so it also crossed Chiang
                        Kaishek. And then it seemed that later your Department of State published
                        papers about our discussion with Marshall. I didn't take the trouble to read
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I haven't read them
                        either.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I don't think you should.
                        Since you have direct discussions with me why do you bother to read these
                        papers? I don't think you would write such memoirs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: (To <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>) And you?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: I have no intention; I am
                        illiterate anyway.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So we cannot impose our
                        thinking on a small country. If one were only proceeding from our thinking,
                        our thinking would be like yours. That is, you go your way and as for
                        Vietnam affairs, you cannot meddle in them anymore. As you said, one month
                        would be too short for the fighting to break out again. It could be a bit
                        longer. But we cannot impose this thinking on them. We cannot fight on their
                        behalf either. Because we already have our joint communique; we have our
                        agreements. It is not like the case in Korea when we said we could not stand
                        by and President Truman didn't believe in us. Because we said that—we cannot
                        stand by. At that time India was still our friend and we issued this warning
                        through the Indian Ambassador to China -if the forces approached the Yalu
                        River we could not stand by.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I ask you a
                        question, as a historian? If we had not gone up to the Yalu River, if we had
                        stopped, say at the narrow neck of the peninsula, would you have come
                        in?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: A little north of the 38th
                        parallel?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d146-06" facs="d146-06"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Once you occupied Pyonyang,
                        you could not stop the momentum of your advance. If you had stopped just a
                        bit north of the 38th parallel, we would not have gone in, because <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim</persName> still at that time had his strength and
                        his forces. But after you landed in Inchon and thrust into Pyonyang you
                        couldn't stop your momentum. You couldn't put a stop to your forces, nor
                        could Sygman Rhee put a stop to his. Once a war breaks out, then the
                        development of that war is often independent of its will—it has its own
                        development. When we told Ambassador Pannikar to inform this to President
                        Truman, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> had already put
                        his forces in place, but we had not made the final decision to cross. If the
                        American forces had just crossed the 38th parallel and fought in that region
                        we wouldn't have done it.</p>
                    <p>But that can only be the thinking of a philosopher. War has it's own laws of
                        development, and we were of the opinion that once you made your landing and
                        took Pyonyang then you would continue your advance. It was easy to shatter
                        their armed forces. Under these circumstances one needs foresight.</p>
                    <p>So the Vietnam question before us also has the same question. For the
                        Vietnamese, from the point of view of their experience, they think it best
                        to solve the political and military questions together. Because the war
                        started out in South Vietnam, so it is their view that a tripartite
                        government should be set up in the south. And if you were to put yourself in
                        the Vietnamese shoes you could understand that is a matter they want to have
                        put forward for consideration if the present regime is not changed and the
                        Saigon regime is a pro-American regime. But if one is to say that should a
                        tripartite government be formed in Vietnam it will surely be a government
                        led by the communists, I don't think one can be so quick. Because there is
                        no question that in such a government the United States would have its
                        share, and France would have its share, and the Soviet Union would have its
                        share too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: France is great at
                        getting shares when it costs and risks nothing. (PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> laughs).</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But you shouldn't blame too
                        much on them. In a certain sense, let us say, in the colonial sense,
                        Mendes-France did something favorable <pb n="7" xml:id="d146-07" facs="d146-07"/>for you. In the sense of the people it wasn't good
                        because it dragged you into a war. Because the war you involved yourself in
                        recently, the war in Vietnam, is the biggest with the greatest losses and
                        expenditures. If you didn't go into Vietnam there would have been no such
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>So as I see it, if you can work out in a good way the setting up of a
                        tripartite government, it couldn't be immediately turned into a communist
                        government. You can say you have been too subjective. When I say communist I
                        mean a genuinely communist government cannot be set up. It would be a
                        government of complex composition. Of course, that government wouldn't
                        completely listen to your behest, nor to the behest of North Vietnam. As for
                        China, we have no interest in interfering. As for you, you will still have
                        the possibility of investment.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Vietnam is costing us
                        an enormous amount of money. I am not aware of any significant American
                        investments in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Japan wants investments
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Japan wants investments
                        everywhere, from Siberia to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Not only to Thailand. To the
                        Indian Ocean. You know, $10 billion of reserves are all American dollars.
                        Your economic policy cannot be a benefit to that so they must invest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They will buy the
                        East-Asia co-prosperity sphere with dollars. It's an interesting historical
                        period.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is true. Indeed they do
                        have these ambitions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I agree with the
                        Prime Minister that the purpose of these dollars is to make investments in
                        underdeveloped areas, not back into the United States.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because otherwise what do they
                        do with that money? It would be useless to just keep it. What else do they
                        do with it? For instance, talking about ants or termites, if you go to
                        Canton or Hainan Island those termites holes are like a mountain. In fact, a
                        termite hole might be as big as this room. So the ants too might be quite
                        formidable. That is their $10 billion.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d146-08" facs="d146-08"/>
                    <p>So if you are to give very careful thought to this matter, to have a
                        political solution in Vietnam, now would not necessarily be to your
                        disadvantage, nor to the disadvantage of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
                        That is why we do not meddle into your negotiations with them because we are
                        not so sure of ourselves or clear about the situation in South Vietnam. If
                        we give specific suggestions and are wrong we will be responsible. So we can
                        only say we approve of your solving the questions through negotiations. We
                        can only tell them that if you continue the fighting we will support you to
                        the end. Secondly, we support you to bring about a solution through
                        negotiations. As to how the negotiations proceed we do not meddle in it at
                        all. As fort you, comparatively speaking, a more advantageous way would be
                        through negotiations.</p>
                    <p>In solving the Indochina question it is not Vietnam alone—it is still a
                        question of Cambodia and Laos, but they are comparatively easier. Because no
                        matter what happens we can say for certain that elements of the national
                        bourgeoisie will take part in such a government, and we can be sure in
                        Cambodia <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> will be the
                        head of state, and in Laos the King will be the head of state. So if it can
                        be solved through negotiations such an outcome would be a matter of
                        certainty.</p>
                    <p>But with this determination of your President—he said it was his decision to
                        engage in bombings and blockade—you have heard the propaganda in the outside
                        world creating various rumors about you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know what the
                        Prime Minister… .</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Saying members of your
                        Administration are opposed to your moves. I don't believe these rumors.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr, Prime Minister,
                        there are members of this Administration who oppose every move we have made,
                        including the move toward China.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Surely. But as I see it, if
                        this policy of yours continues without change it is disadvantageous to you
                        and disadvantageous to the relaxation of world tension. Because as I said,
                        the other day, if you force the Vietnamese into a corner then they will go
                        desperate.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d146-09" facs="d146-09"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Were you finished?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Just up to now. You have
                        declared you do not want to destroy them militarily and what is more you
                        admit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a strong factor in
                        Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And a permanent
                        factor.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And what is more you said that
                        when you withdraw all your forces including advisors, Army, Navy and Air
                        Force, the Vietnamese will be able to solve their problems themselves. And I
                        particularly make it a point, to make it clear now we would approve this
                        course of action. But we are China—we understand this logic of this course
                        of action and you used this course of action to achieve victory.</p>
                    <p>At the time the Soviet Union had a treaty with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. Their treaty was called the Sino-Soviet
                        Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, whereas in the treaty we had we added
                        other wording, “Mutual Assistance.” Outer Mongolia was lost to them by
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, not by us. It was
                        written in the treaty of alliance between <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> and the Soviet Union. When Gromyko went to Japan,
                        Japan recognized the People's Republic of Mongolia and Gromyko cursed them.
                        When I saw them I laughed. Why is <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> trying to play the hero?</p>
                    <p>So we Chinese are able to understand this policy. But for the Vietnamese,
                        they cannot rely on such a policy. Since the war in the north and south has
                        become one, and the war in Indochina as a whole has become one, they would
                        like to see a final solution to the question before they can find themselves
                        at ease.</p>
                    <p>As to the composition of a tripartite government we don't want to meddle in
                        that. We only hope negotiations between you and North Vietnam will find a
                        way out. We can only express our support for that. We cannot say anything
                        more.</p>
                    <p>And as we just now mentioned in the car, each side has its fear. You have the
                        same fear of the seven points that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has of
                        the eight points. So the problem is only for you to thrash <pb n="10" xml:id="d146-10" facs="d146-10"/>the problem out with the Vietnamese at
                        your secret conference table. Otherwise, the consequence will be continued
                        fighting and the result will be highly disadvantageous. Before you had
                        correct ideas—maybe now you have some mistaken notions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When did I have correct
                        ideas?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You said if the war continues,
                        the Soviet Union will be most happy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I still believe
                        that.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And India, Because if the war
                        continues it will be a constant burden on you and also on us, though we are
                        not taking part directly in the war. But at least an obstacle will be placed
                        between our two countries with the continuation of the war.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No question. This is
                        not so from our side, and maybe not from your side completely, but that is
                        the hope of the countries who do not want an improvement in our
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is so, and that is a more
                        principled way. We shouldn't look at things in a static way. Sometimes a
                        specific country may change its views on certain matters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, I
                        think this is a very fair and just view of the situation. I think you have
                        explained the dilemma extremely well, and you are telling us, in effect, you
                        can understand our point of view, you might even accept it if we were
                        dealing with you, but you can also understand Hanoi's difficulty. As I told
                        you in the car, first, your views are always taken extremely seriously by
                        us, more seriously than of almost any other leader, and as some of my
                        contacts have pointed out, too seriously by me.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But these views of mine are
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s views.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course. I
                        understand. So you can be certain we will examine what you have said with
                        the greatest care.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d146-11" facs="d146-11"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because when we consider any
                        question we always proceed from a very serious manner and in a calm way, not
                        trying to convince the other through some maneuver or sleight of hand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And you have proved
                        this by what you just said, which was a principled way of putting the
                        problem. We will make, as I told you in the car, a major effort this summer
                        to solve the situation, and if we make any headway at all we will reduce the
                        scale of our military assistance drastically. We have not yet settled the
                        precise time of the resumption with the North Vietnamese, but it can only be
                        a question of a week in the second half of July.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Indeed to wait for some time
                        might help to consider things in a more calm way.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, I don't want
                        to mislead the Prime Minister, Until the talks start, the military actions,
                        with the restrictions I mentioned this afternoon, will continue.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But I can only draw your
                        attention to the fact that if such military operations are too excessive it
                        can only anger our people more.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have your view on
                        this very much in mind.</p>
                    <p>Now we, of course, believe that the view you too think is the best, is the
                        way one should proceed, and it is a view we will put forward in the
                        negotiation. But we will not reject in advance any propositions which the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam will make to us, and we will examine them
                        very carefully.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: And you too may put forward
                        your propositions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I, of course, greatly
                        respect the Prime Minister's reluctance to discuss with a neighboring
                        country on substance, but I don't know whether the same restriction applies
                        to advising with respect to style, and at least the minimum amount of
                        confidence required for conducting a negotiation.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d146-12" facs="d146-12"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So long as you proceed from a
                        position of sincerity they should also reciprocate with sincerity. But you
                        should understand that after such a long period of tempering in such wars,
                        their attitudes and style are likely to be what they are.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will proceed from a
                        position of sincerity, or at least do our best, but it is extremely
                        difficult if one must conduct a negotiation with Le Duc Tho and the New York
                        Times which has been given information by <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc
                            Tho</persName>. The Vice Foreign Minister conducted a negotiation with
                        the New York Times this fall, so he knows what this is like.</p>
                    <p>So if they can deal with us seriously, and if they will use the opportunity
                        of talking to me in a sensible way, that is to say they are dealing with
                        someone who can make rapid decisions on a big scale, I think we have a good
                        chance of ending the war this summer, which would be advantageous to
                        everybody.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But you should realize that
                        strictly speaking the war is taking place on Vietnamese soil.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand, and I
                        also understand we are the larger country so we have a particular
                        obligation.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: As I said yesterday about
                        Taiwan, with a population of 15 million it is a matter for the Chinese to
                        say it. But for Japan with respect to Okinawa, they couldn't do that even
                        though they are a defeated island. Because even the Senkaku Islands, they
                        are still quarreling over that with us with no population at all.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But when the Prime
                        Minister read that one line from the poem about being farsighted, I believe
                        if we are far-sighted in Southeast Asia, both the United States and the
                        People's Republic of China have an interest in keeping the region free from
                        big countries. And if we are far-sighted, we can see the day when the United
                        States will help Hanoi rather than fight Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That is right.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d146-13" facs="d146-13"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I do want to assure,
                        above all, the Prime Minister that we will approach these negotiations with
                        a sincere intention of bringing about an end to the war and with every
                        attempt to end it this summer.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Speaking openly, we declared
                        openly that we demand a cessation of your bombing and blockade of the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but here in these private talks in a
                        friendly way, I would say that if your President would stop the bombing and
                        blockade it would be advantageous to us. I believe Professor Fairbank has
                        already told you about what I asked those other Americans about <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>. That is, I asked them could
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>, if he were elected,
                        cut one-third of the military budget, and no one could reply.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I talked to Fairbank
                        only about comparing the China he knew with China now.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He didn't tell you about
                        this?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but you had told
                        me, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I said it, but the
                        correspondents didn't report it, which shows partiality. Miss Tang can bear
                        witness because she was interpreter at the time. I was very sharp in raising
                        the question at the time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I had seen your
                        criticism, or what they reported as your criticism of the Vietnam
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: It will indeed be the best
                        thing if you are able to succeed in your negotiations with them. But if the
                        war has to continue, then as I said it would be best if you can still stop
                        your bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and stop the blockade
                        because that would help to promote negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, about the material we gave you about the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft intrusions and bombings, there is specific evidence
                        showing we were the victims of these intrusions and bombings. And also about
                        the damage to our merchant ships on May 6, 7, and 8, on which you said you
                        would inform us through the Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You received a note
                        through the Paris channel.</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="d146-14" facs="d146-14"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, we have already received
                        your notification saying it was unauthorized. And with respect to these
                        incidents, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> instructed us
                        not to make it public, but to tell it to you through these secret channels,
                        and so this may also be considered one of the ways of making efforts to
                        normalize relations between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We view it that way,
                        too.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But in your replies to this
                        you always say that first, it is possible that your military units concerned
                        do not want to admit their errors. So because of that the reply is the
                        investigation is inconclusive, so our military units are dissatisfied. If it
                        is merely a question of our units being dissatisfied we can deal with that.
                        The main thing is such incidents shouldn't occur again because if they do
                        then it will turn into a political matter, something we can no longer keep
                        secret.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have changed the
                        operating procedures, and it is therefore extremely unlikely that another
                        intrusion will occur. You said nothing has happened since June 12, the day
                        the new instructions were given, so I believe the problem is solved. We will
                        re-investigate based on your chart, and if we can find any additional
                        evidence that is conclusive we will punish the people involved. But based on
                        our experience, you have never in the past complained about violations that
                        were unjustified.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s Air Force sometimes still makes intrusions
                        into airspace over the mainland in planes which you give them, but we can
                        distinguish between theirs and yours. You have given them U-2 reconnaissance
                        planes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. But we have moved
                        every activity in which we are engaged farther away from your coast, as you
                        know.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Air reconnaissance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. And on the Paracel
                        Islands, when you protested we accepted your protest and instituted a limit
                        on March 12.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Any other suggestions?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, as always when I
                        am here I feel obliged to say a word about Mr. Downey. And I can only say
                        again we don't contest the justice of the sentence, but we would appreciate
                        an act of clemency, particularly in view of the age of his mother.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d146-15" facs="d146-15"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We have taken note of this.
                        Your President mentioned this, too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but I will be
                        asked by the family of Downey when I return, and I wanted to be able to say
                        I had raised the issue.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So far as I know Downey is in
                        good health. I just asked Mrs. Ma to check up on it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When I return to
                        Washington, there will be a question how to handle this visit vis-a-vis the
                        press.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: With respect to the
                        announcement which you suggested, we approve of your idea of issuing an
                        announcement. We will give you a specific answer in the morning. Maybe we
                        will just delete a few words from your draft. For instance, with respect to
                        the discussions, we have held you used three adjectives, and we suggest
                        using only two—that is just “earnest and frank.” Because to say
                        “constructive”—there have been not too many constructive exchanges. But we
                        agree to what is later on, the continuation of these discussions is useful
                        and desirable. But these ideas must first be approved by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> before that can be finalized. He has not
                        yet seen it. We have just sent him a draft.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is fine. Then when
                        I am asked I think it will help to have this. Would 11:00 Saturday morning
                        American time be a good time to release it?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: All right. No question about
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't want to have it
                        released before I am back so that I can handle the press. Tomorrow is
                        Friday, and then we do it Saturday. I will be back in Washington the late
                        afternoon of Friday, which is too late to release it to the press, so we
                        will do it at 11:00 Saturday morning.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's all right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to be very
                        correct in making sure we agree what I can say to the press. Can I tell the
                        press who participated in the discussions? I want to give Ambassador
                            <persName>Malik</persName> something to worry about.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You will surely mention Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Chang</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d146-16" facs="d146-16"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no need to
                        mention the Vice Chairman, but I will be glad to mention him. Should I
                        mention the Vice Chairman?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Maybe not.</p>
                    <p>Miss Tang: We have reported that he attended the banquet.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's fine. So I will
                        mention that the discussions were primarily with this group.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I also say that
                        some members of my group held parallel discussions with appropriate members
                        of the Chinese Government headed by Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, you may do that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If they asked me what
                        was discussed I will say we reviewed bilateral matters and the general
                        international situation.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That's all right.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If they asked me
                        whether Vietnam was discussed, I will say yes, but give no details.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Will you say discussed or
                        exchanged views?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will say we exchanged
                        views—do you prefer that? And I will even make clear our views didn't
                        coincide.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: You may do that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: At any rate, I will not
                        leave any wrong implications.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: With regard to those who took
                        part in the discussion, you might add Miss Wang Haijung, who is also an
                        Assistant Minister. Otherwise you will again be omitting a lady. Anything
                        more?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On any other topic if I
                        am asked I will say I won't go into the details of the discussion, except to
                        say it was a general review.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Good.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d146-17" facs="d146-17"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I do want to thank you,
                        Mr. Prime Minister, for the extraordinary hospitality that has been shown to
                        us. And I want to assure you of what I hope has become clear by some of our
                        actions, that the normalization of relations between our two countries is
                        one of the key aspects of our foreign policy which we will pursue with great
                        energy and which we hope to develop even further.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: The normalization itself will
                        have to wait until after the elections.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but progress
                        toward it.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Under the present
                        circumstances, before your Presidential elections I don't believe that there
                        will be anything urgent which would require our [Ambassador Huang] going to
                        Washington. The New York channel is sufficient for now. If you yourself are
                        too busy, you can send some of your colleagues—General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>, having been promoted, may not be
                        able to do it, but maybe Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> or
                        Commander Howe.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would have to be an
                        emergency beyond anything we can foresee. Then let us leave it in New York;
                        no need to come to Washington. And it has worked very well up to now. I will
                        call on your Ambassador next week before I go to California, to give him
                        some of this additional information.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Four more months before the election, so you will be getting very busy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I can only hope that
                        you will be patient with any aberrations that occur in that hectic
                        period.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When I receive the two leaders
                        of the House of Representatives I will meet them together. Perhaps their
                        understanding of the international situation is not as good as leaders of
                        the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. Mr. Boggs is a very
                        elemental type, very intelligent, a skilled maneuverer of the parliamentary
                        situation, and a southerner. He is more effective in the morning than after
                        dinner. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> is on the more
                        conservative side of the Republican Party, not extraordinarily intelligent,
                        but very steady and a useful bridge to the people who would normally oppose
                        our China policy. If a Democrat had done what we did, he would have accused
                        him of treason. Since we did it, he is supporting us against his better
                        judgment.</p>

                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> is from the north?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Michigan, but from the
                        countryside in Michigan.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He is an old Congressman?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He has been in the
                        Congress for a long time.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Both have been.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Both have been. Boggs
                        is on the more conservative side of the Democratic Party, and would be, on
                        domestic policy, more on the conservative side.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: I suppose that will be enough
                        for the representatives of the two parties to come here this year.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that should
                        exhaust the visits of political figures.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Suppose the Presidential
                        candidates of both parties want to visit China. What should we do?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The one of the
                        Republican party has just visited China.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: But what about his Vice
                        Presidential candidate, because the Democratic party may put this forward as
                        a challenge to you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The President didn't
                        come as a candidate. He came as the President of the United States, and you
                        didn't invite him as a candidate.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Of course, it's not a question
                        of your President coming again. But if the Democrats were to say, suppose
                        the Vice Presidential candidate of the Republican and Democratic parties
                        came to visit China together. Is that possible?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Highly unlikely. It is
                        not impossible that they put forward the visit of the Democratic
                        candidate.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Individually?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is not impossible.
                        I am giving you my judgment. I don't know.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d146-19" facs="d146-19"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Before these political leaders
                        have requested but we didn't reply: Fuibright, Muskie, <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName> and <persName>Kennedy</persName>.
                        You have also suggested that one of your justices visit, Justice Douglas,
                        through the Paris channel.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: May I make one thing
                        clear. When we transmit a request through the Paris channel, that doesn't
                        mean we endorse it. It just means a senior American has asked us to transmit
                        his request. We leave it up to you. Our view about Douglas is he is
                        politically opposed to the President, but he is in a non-political position,
                        so we leave the decision entirely up to you, and we do not oppose it on our
                        side.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Cyrus Eaton, that old
                        industrialist?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In my personal candid
                        opinion, I think he's a fool (laughter). If you would like to invite him we
                        have no objection. He is not nearly as important as he thinks he is. He is
                        very rich and can therefore finance study groups and can hold conferences
                        (laughter).</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He is a doctor, PhD?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, he's an
                        industrialist who was a ruthless financier and who in his late years has
                        suddenly decided that he would bring about universal peace because he is
                        more intelligent than all the statesmen of the world.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He has been engaged in such
                        activities for twenty years.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Soviet Union used
                        him for a long time, but gave up on him because he is so inadequate. We have
                        no objection to his coming here, but there is a better use of senior
                        peoples' time than Cyrus Eaton.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: So there are such people in
                        your society?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh yes. He organized
                        these international conferences called Pugwash Conferences and financed
                        them, and even though he paid for them he became such an embarrassment to
                        the people who ran them that he was barred from his own conferences
                        (laughter).</p>
                    <p>So if you can take him off our hands for a month it would be not unwelcome. I
                        would get much fewer letters for a while.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="d146-20" facs="d146-20"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: What party does he favor?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would think maybe the
                        Democrats, but no candidate will accept his public support. They all accept
                        his money, but not his public support (laughter). He is not a political
                        figure, and if you invite him we will not suspect that you are intervening
                        in our political life.</p>
                    <p>I don't remember that a Presidential candidate, as a candidate, has ever
                        visited a foreign country, and that would be very unusual; and he would then
                        bring a very large press corps and that would make China inevitably an issue
                        in the campaign.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Is the China lobby still very
                        active?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is active, but it
                        has to attach itself now with some other dissatisfied group to be effective.
                        But they are a vocal minority now, not a majority.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Mcintyre doesn't have much
                        influence now?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but it would not be
                        difficult. Not Mcintyre, because he's a little unbalanced, but if somebody
                        wanted to put together the people who were for Wallace with the right-wing
                        of the Republican Party and appeal on the basis of general anti-Communism,
                        not the People's Republic but general anti-Communism, he could be a very
                        potent factor.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: When you say anti-Communism,
                        you say also anti-Soviet?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, both.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Still the old ideas?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Does Wallace belong to such a
                        faction?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Many of his supporters
                        do, and what is interesting is that before he was shot he had received more
                        votes in Democratic primaries than <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>. So if you put that together with the conservatives
                        in the Republican Party, that can become a very major force.</p>
                    <p>PM Cho: He's a southerner, Wallace?</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d146-21" facs="d146-21"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, he's a southerner.
                        But he had a number of handicaps. He's a small man. He speaks effectively,
                        but doesn't have a snob appeal. If someone with
                        <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s manners had expressed Wallace's views he
                        would have even greater impact.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: What do you think about Robert
                        Williams?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know him.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Robert Williams is undergoing
                        trial. He had lived in China for some time in the past.</p>
                    <p>Miss Tang: He is now on trial in a certain state and is not allowed to leave
                        the state.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you know the
                        state?</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: We can find out. We don't want
                        to say much more—just to let you know we received tens of thousands of
                        letters from Japan asking us to support Robert Williams. They may have been
                        written by ultra-leftists, or people taken in by them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not familiar with
                        the case. If it were someone like Angela Davis or a well-known case in
                        America, we would have heard about it. I will look into it. I won't inform
                        you about it, because I don't think I should inform you about domestic
                        American matters at this time, but I will inform myself.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: That was just prior to the
                        arrival of your President. We researched these letters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: To me it looks like a
                        provocation, but I don't want to say it because I don't know about it.</p>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: He called himself the
                        President of the new African Republic in the United States. I had some
                        discussions with him; how is it possible for him to set himself as the
                        President of a country in a country? So he was displeased with us and
                        left.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, he was here?</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="d146-22" facs="d146-22"/>
                    <p>PM <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes he was here when he was
                        elected.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I can't imagine what
                        group he represented. Maybe the Black Panthers.</p>
                    <p>[After the meeting, outside the meeting room Mr. <persName>Chang</persName>
                        reported to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on Mr.

                    <p>INFORMATION</p>
                    <p>June 27, 1972</p>
                    <p>The Sequence</p>
                    <p>At a time when we are blockading and bombing China's socialist ally, and ten
                        days after several transgressions of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s borders, I had in many respects my most extensive talks ever
                        with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, and our party had in
                        most respects the most cordial reception.</p>
                    <p>In three working days I held seventeen hours of formal meetings with the
                        Chinese, almost fourteen with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and
                        one special two and a half hour session with the next most powerful leader
                        and the top military man, Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Yeh
                            Chien-ying</persName>. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and I had about six hours of informal, but generally
                        substantive, conversations at two banquets, car rides, and on a boat cruise
                        at the Summer Palace. Others in my party spent four and a half hours with
                        Chinese officials on bilateral matters, such as exchanges and trade.</p>
                    <p>Briefly our scenario ran as follows:</p>
                    <p>— After dinner on the first night—within an hour of our arrival—<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> came to the Guest House for a general
                        plenary session followed by almost an hour's private meeting on Vietnam,
                        Japan, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        bilateral contacts, and the agenda for the visit.</p>
                    <p>— On June 20, we toured the Forbidden City in the morning; I spent four hours
                        with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> at the Great Hall of the
                        People on the Soviet Union and Vietnam; and attended a banquet hosted by
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> where <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>, in front of the top leadership,
                        proposed a toast affirming that normalization of relations would
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>— On June 21, I had almost three hours with <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName>; talked for three and a half hours with
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> on the Soviet Union and
                        Vietnam again; and attended a performance of the Peking opera with the
                        Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d147-02" facs="d147-02"/>
                    <p>— On June 22, the Minister of Sports guided us through an Athletic Academy;
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and I discussed the global
                        situation and individual Asian and European problems on a wide scale from
                        mid-afternoon at the Guest House through a cruise and dinner at the Summer
                        Palace; and we held a final two-hour session late in the evening at the
                        Guest House, including Vietnam, miscellaneous other topics and the final
                        announcement.</p>
                    <p>Both in the variety of subjects covered and the fact that for once <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> stated rather fully Chinese intentions,
                        these talks were broader in scope than on my two previous visits. As
                        indicated above, essentially they fell under three headings:</p>
                    <p>— Vietnam, the only issue that significantly hinders our bilateral
                        relations;</p>
                    <p>— The Soviet Union, China's main preoccupation and principal motive for
                        moving ahead with us; and</p>
                    <p>— A general assessment of global events, on which it was striking how far the
                        Chinese had moved in the past year from an adversary posture to one which
                        can only be described as tacit ally.</p>
                    <p>Following are the highlights of our substantive discussion. I am sending you
                        a separate memorandum on the atmospherics of the visit.</p>
                    <p>Vietnam</p>
                    <p>This was the predominant issue and was treated in almost all of our
                        discussions. There were three strands that were consistently woven into
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s presentations:</p>
                    <p>— The personal sympathy of <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and
                        other Chinese leaders for the North Vietnamese on revolutionary and
                        historical grounds. The struggle of <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi
                            Minh</persName> and his followers obviously strikes a strong emotional
                        response in those who have been fifty years on their Long March.</p>
                    <p>— The political and ideological obligations of the People's Republic of China
                        to support Hanoi and to make a clear record on, and for, their behalf.</p>
                    <p>— The practical requirements of Chinese national policy which are often
                        inconsistent with the first two elements.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d147-03" facs="d147-03"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> spoke often and with warmth of
                        his kinship with the suffering North Vietnamese. And he made an extensive
                        record of official support. But the essential fact of his presentations was
                        a hands-off attitude on both military and negotiating questions: China will
                        not intervene directly and will be happy with whatever we and Hanoi can work
                        out at the conference table. And the essential tenor of his verbal support
                        for their allies was unemotional, desultory, almost apologetic at times.
                        Thus the imperatives of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> national policy
                        so far have kept the personal and ideological impulses in bounds.</p>
                    <p>Our conversation constituted the first really detailed discussion of Vietnam
                        that we have had with the Chinese. We moved beyond historical recitation and
                        formal positions to rather precise exchanges on a solution to the war and
                        its aftermath.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s approach provided an
                        interesting contrast with the Soviet technique:</p>
                    <p>— He was more interested in the general outcome and evolution of events in
                        Indochina whereas <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, and
                        especially <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, concentrated on
                        the tactical questions at the conference table. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> showed interest in U.S. intentions and regional role
                        after a settlement, while the Russians zeroed in on specific elements of a
                        deal.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s support of Hanoi and criticism
                        of our military actions was much less harsh than the Dacha attacks, although
                        one senses a much greater emotional affinity to the Struggling North
                        Vietnamese on the part of the Chinese revolutionary leaders than the second
                        generation, more “bourgeois” Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> showed more understanding of—and
                        asked more questions about—a military solution only, while the Soviets
                        probed hard on political elements.</p>
                    <p>— While both Peking and Moscow are not letting Vietnam block our bilateral
                        relations, I believe the more “principled” Chinese approach means that they
                        will be less willing than the Russians to exert actual pressure on Hanoi to
                        be reasonable.</p>
                    <p>At the outset of our discussions <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        pursued a discussion of a possible ceasefire. He posed a series of detailed
                        questions concerning the duration of a ceasefire before fighting might
                        resume among the Vietnamese themselves. He was interested in what the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role would be if the conflict erupted again
                        after we had completed our withdrawal.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d147-04" facs="d147-04"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> went on officially to support the
                        North Vietnamese position that a settlement include political as well as
                        military issues, but he made clear this was their position. He pointedly
                        noted that not even <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName> would
                        be able to replace <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>. His
                        comments reflected a recognition of the difficult straits in which Hanoi
                        finds itself. He cautioned us not to “corner” the North Vietnamese or try to
                        defeat them. And he somewhat mildly called for an ending of bombing and
                        blockading of the North, saying this would have a beneficial impact on
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>His only real warmth, however, came in his protesting of our alleged recent
                        air intrusions of their territory, i.e., when the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is directly challenged. He had charts and photographs to
                        bolster their case that our planes had violated their territory on several
                        occasions and had actually dropped two bombs inside their border on June 10.
                        He went over the detailed plots of our alleged intrusions with us and
                        displayed the navy bomb cannisters that he said were dropped by our
                        planes.</p>
                    <p>I rejoined by saying that we obviously had no interest in challenging the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> directly and that any intrusions
                        were unauthorized or accidental. I recounted the various investigations and
                        responses we had made to their delegation and went over the most recent
                        report by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> which cited
                        several instances where our findings did not confirm their allegations. In
                        any event, we had instituted new procedures which would create a larger
                        buffer zone from <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> territory for our
                        aircraft and which should have ended these incidents once and for all.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> confirmed that there had been
                        no intrusions since these procedures took effect on June 12.</p>
                    <p>In laying out Chinese positions, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        made clear that he was not issuing any threats. For example, when I asked
                        him whether his reference to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s
                        “gritting its teeth” implied direct military support, and I warned him about
                        it, he emphasized that the Chinese would not intervene unless directly
                        attacked; he was referring only to making sure supplies reached North
                        Vietnam. At the end of one session, he stressed that if the war persists our
                        two countries must nevertheless continue to attempt to relax tensions. And
                        at another session, he said that there was an impasse and asked what we
                        should do about the Indochina situation. He even agreed with my suggestion
                        that at some point in the future the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might
                        be aiding Hanoi against outside pressures.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, at times <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was somewhat
                        defensive about the Chinese role. He strenuously denied the Chinese had
                        anything to do with the North Vietnamese offensive, or indeed would have
                        advised if it asked, a change I told him we <pb n="5" xml:id="d147-05" facs="d147-05"/>had heard from the Soviets and East Europeans. <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName> volunteered these points
                        emphatically as well. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> pointed out
                        that our aid to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> greatly exceeded
                        theirs to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He also indicated that
                        after a settlement, China would reduce military aid to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, e.g., no more provision of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19's.</p>
                    <p>Throughout I maintained our general themes that we have been playing with the
                        Chinese: It is the Soviets and the Indians, not the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, that have longterm designs on Southeast Asia; our policies
                        are not those of the 1950's; you will resolutely pursue your course; we will
                        never make peace by betraying an ally; and a military solution (ceasefire,
                        withdrawal, prisoner release) is the quickest way to end the conflict,
                        leaving the political process to the Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>All this culminated in <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s closing
                        presentation on Vietnam the last evening, which went as follows:</p>
                    <p>— The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should leave Vietnam and let the
                        Vietnamese solve their problems without outside interference, fighting
                        behind “closed doors.”</p>
                    <p>— The Chinese communists had the courage to live with a ceasefire with Chiang
                        Kai-shek after Japan's defeat, knowing they would eventually prevail. If
                        China were fighting it would accept your May 8 proposal but China could not
                        impose it on North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>— A ceasefire that lasted only a month after our withdrawal would be too
                        short. This period could be extended, but the Chinese could not dictate this
                        to their ally, any more than they would fight for them.</p>
                    <p>— The North Vietnamese think a political solution should be part of a
                        settlement; and a tripartite government would have many forces and would not
                        necessarily be communist-controlled or hostile to us.</p>
                    <p>— The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would approve the course of action
                        your May 8 speech suggests, i.e., ceasefire, withdrawal, prisoner release
                        and leaving the political solution to the Vietnamese alone. The Chinese
                        understand this policy but Vietnam is reluctant to rely upon it.</p>
                    <p>— The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> hopes we will solve Vietnam through
                        negotiations, but won't meddle. It is up to us and Hanoi.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d147-06" facs="d147-06"/>
                    <p>Thus <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> admitted that our approach to
                        a settlement is reasonable and underlined this by his comments that neither
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName> nor anyone else could
                        actually proceed to overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> Government. But one of his major themes was that North
                        Vietnam could not be expected to have China's perspective. It is a much
                        smaller country: the two zones of Vietnam have only 30 million people and
                        the twenty-seven year old struggle is their only issue while China, with 750
                        million people, can wait on the question of Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>In short, we cannot expect to solve the Vietnam issue in Peking, anymore than
                        we can solve it in Moscow. But our dealings with both capitals are
                        strengthening our hand. For we have two objectives with the Chinese and
                        Russians concerning Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>— As a minimum, their acquiescence in what we are doing, i.e., their
                        willingness to put their other concerns with us above the local concern of
                        their ally.</p>
                    <p>— If possible, their exercise of pressure on Hanoi to come to a reasonable
                        settlement of the war.</p>
                    <p>We can be reasonably sure that the Chinese will continue to practice the
                        first of these two, though they will remain very sensitive to direct
                        challenges such as border violations or embarrassing them in our public
                        statements. And the visible record of their dealings with us—my visit, the
                        announcements pertaining to it, our front page treatment in the People's
                        Daily—must deepen the North Vietnamese sense of isolation.</p>
                    <p>As for the second objective, if <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        talks to North Vietnamese leaders along lines even remotely akin to his
                        presentation to us, this cannot help but add to the cumulative pressures on
                        Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>One cannot exaggerate the Chinese disquiet over the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s preoccupation with the “new Czars”
                        was a constant theme throughout our conversations, and became increasingly
                        explicit. He punctuated this concern with biting historical references to
                        past Soviet misdeeds, critical descriptions of Soviet intentions and
                        policies, sardonic references to Soviet style. As seen once again from
                        Peking, as from Moscow, the Sino-Soviet rift is deep and almost certainly
                        won't be mended by the present leaderships.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s analysis of Moscow's
                        motivations was strikingly similar to that of the Shah of Iran. The Soviets
                        are trying to free their rear in Europe so as to outflank us in the Middle
                        East, using the radical Arab states on one side and India on the other. They
                        are spreading into Southeast Asia, not only through their support of Hanoi,
                        but also through Indian policies. All the while they are maintaining their
                        pressures on China's northern borders. As <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName> put it, the Soviets are “fanatic
                        expansionists.”</p>
                    <p>In this context their major potential ally is the United States and both
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YJ2">Marshal Yeh</persName> made obvious their desire for
                        the U.S. to maintain unimpaired strength. They asked a series of leading
                        questions on our military posture designed to reassure themselves of our
                        power vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Thus <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> stressed on a couple of occasions that disarmament is
                        is impossible, that the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> or other
                        agreements might limit arms in certain fields, but there would be increases
                        in others. He noted that the MIG-21s were of poor quality and that our F-4s
                        were superior. He and the Marshal asked about our nuclear technology, our
                        strategic posture versus Moscow in various categories as a result of <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, our future deployments in Europe, etc.
                        They wanted to make sure that our nuclear weapons technology remained ahead
                        of that of the Soviets, that our overall defense position would counter the
                        Russians, that <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss> would not go too far,
                        etc. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> openly admired <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s outspokenness on the need for a
                        strong defense, making that point several times.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s presentations were sprinkled
                        with cynical comments on the Soviet Union:</p>
                    <p>— The Soviets had made certain feelers toward Peking for better relations,
                        but Peking was rejecting them. The Sino-Soviet border talks were getting
                        nowhere; after three years the Russians wouldn't even agree to codify
                        agreed-upon working principles.</p>
                    <p>— The Chinese would never borrow from Moscow again.</p>
                    <p>— When dealing with the Soviets, one should have documents carefully prepared
                        ahead of time.</p>
                    <p>— In contrast to Peking's restraint, Moscow was heaping abuse on the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> for dealing with the U.S. while the Vietnam
                        war continued. It was clear that the Soviets wouldn't attempt to get
                        supplies to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (i.e., through our
                        blockade).</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d147-08" facs="d147-08"/>
                    <p>— The Soviet Union always wants to exceed the U.S. in military terms. Under
                        the present leadership they would never agree to cut back armaments.</p>
                    <p>— <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was content to hear (from me)
                        that the Soviets disliked him and were fast moving him up in their pantheon
                        of enemies.</p>
                    <p>— There was no question of the existence of Soviet global ambitions. The
                        question was whether and how these would be manifested. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would continue to watch developments
                        closely.</p>
                    <p>My basic approach was to play the ominous Soviet themes and emphasize that a
                        strong U.S. and developing U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ties
                        were the best antidotes. At the same time I left no doubt that we would
                        continue to make agreements with Moscow that served our national
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>I described at length our moves with Moscow since last July, with particular
                        emphasis on my April trip, your Summit, and the various bilateral agreements
                        we have signed. I emphasized our constant themes with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, such as not joining in any agreements that
                        might be directed against them, keeping them fully informed, and being
                        willing to conclude any agreements with them that we do with Moscow. The
                        Soviet strategy had been to accelerate agreements with us since last July in
                        order, to put pressure on the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>; in this
                        regard I emphasized the value to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> of
                        increasing its bilateral contacts in trade and exchanges with us. We will
                        conclude agreements with Moscow in the hope of influencing them towards a
                        peaceful route; if they turned aggressive, we would not let our agreements
                        stop us from countering them.</p>
                    <p>Above all, I made clear your determination to maintain a strong defense and
                        our willingness to use it if necessary to deflect pressures brought to bear
                        on the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. I recalled your tough, risky
                        moves against Moscow in last December's South Asian crisis. As for nuclear
                        weapons, we could not rule out first use, because there were at least two
                        situations where they might be needed. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> pointedly asked what these were, and I replied that I
                        was referring to an attack on Europe or one in Asia that threatened basic
                        forces there (i.e. the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>). My elliptic
                        comment was not lost upon him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> repeated that they favored a
                        relaxation of tensions between the USSR and us. I suspect this is for the
                        record and for his pride, because in practice he is doubtful about every
                        concrete manifestation. He indicated doubts about the European detente and
                        concern about our credits being the <pb n="9" xml:id="d147-09" facs="d147-09"/>one way the strained Soviet economy could fuel their
                        arms buildup. He was repeatedly critical of <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>, his obvious displeasure being keyed to the
                        Senator's intention to cut the defense budget by one-third; I carefully
                        infomed him that while such a course would be disastrous, the Senator was
                        nevertheless likely to try and carry it out. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> Made clear that such weakening of our defense was not
                        only impossible to implement but dangerous in its implications for the world
                        and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In short, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made no attempt to hide
                        the Chinese preoccupation with Moscow. In this respect too, his statements
                        have strikingly evolved since last July when this theme was generally kept
                        below the surface. The Chinese will continue to maintain that they can take
                        care of themselves. But their dealings with us and their obvious recognition
                        that only a strong United States is of use to them, make clear that they
                        welcome, indeed seek, the balance we provide.</p>
                    <p>Global Survey</p>
                    <p>For whatever reasons, the Chinese stands on various countries and regions
                        around the world have become similar to ours in many respects. They show a
                        much greater comprehension of the complexity of the global situation. They
                        have come to accept our rationale and many of our assessments, and they
                        recognize the need for joint efforts to stabilize such areas as Japan, Korea
                        and Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>The overriding Chinese concern with the Soviet Union clearly colors their
                        world outlook. They are tyring to build walls around the Soviet Union. They
                        seek major leverage with Moscow by dealing with us. On the Soviet's western
                        flank they will encourage a united Europe as a counterweight to the Soviet
                        Union and are trying to increase their own influence in Europe as well. They
                        will probably move with Japan in the east. To the south they are trying to
                        contain India by supporting an independent Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>In this regard <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> brought up European
                        questions on several occasions. He believed that collectively Europe
                        represented great potential power, but it would need strong leadership. Thus
                        he confirmed that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has changed its
                        tack and will support the EEC and other forms of European unity.</p>
                    <p>Chou placed great stress on our maintaining our forces in Europe. He agreed
                        with my judgment that, under your Administration, we would not substantially
                            <pb n="10" xml:id="d147-10" facs="d147-10"/>withdraw forces from Europe
                        over the next five years. Again returning to the opposition, he said that
                        the Democrats wouldn't be able to withdraw our troops from Europe if they
                        gained power. He expressed concern that mutual and balanced force reductions
                        might go too far—I told him that I doubted they would exceed 10%-15% in the
                        near term.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is also engaged in a deliberate
                        strategy of giving Western European leaders the option of another communist
                        country to deal with other than the Soviet Union. Thus <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, Schuman, and Home are all coming
                        to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> this year. He asked my advice at
                        some length on how to deal with these men and requested that I tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> to speak candidly to
                        him. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was especially interested in
                        Germany and obviously hooped it would provide an effective balance to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the future. He did not want to
                        entertain the prospect (which I held out as a possibility of West Germany's
                        becoming “Finlandized,” i.e. beholden to Moscow on international and even
                        internal policies. He thought (and wished) that the basic German drive would
                        make that nation a force to be reckoned with. As for East Germany, however,
                        he briskly dismissed it as already being a dependency of Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> also was skeptical (and unhappy) with
                        my view that there were no strong leaders on the horizon in Germany. He
                        shared my admiration for Adenauer, and recalled that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> had once noted Adenauer's prescient
                        prediction of better U.S.-PRC relations.</p>
                    <p>From these talks it is obvious that we will have to treat the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> carefully with regard to our European
                        policy. Progress toward detente on Moscow's western front cannot please the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>; our task in Peking is to make sure
                        the Chinese do not suspect our motives as we contribute to this detente.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Japan, Chinese views have greatly changed from what I heard
                        last summer and fall and you heard, to a lesser extent, in February. I
                        believe our presentations on this area have had their impact.</p>
                    <p>Chou used to lecture us on the dangers of Japanese militarism and the
                        undesirability of our Mutual Security Treaty. We have pointed out that the
                        latter was the best check on the former. This time <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> did not question this perspective and
                        did not challenge the treaty. He confined himself to inquiring whether the
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> leadership might want to
                        amend the treaty; and he specifically attacked any U.S.-Japanese
                        responsibilities for the defense of Taiwan. (Incidentally, this was one of
                        very few references to the Taiwan issue.)</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d147-11" facs="d147-11"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> acknowledged my view that Japan
                        was moving out in four ways: with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                        through Siberian development; in Southeast Asia, through its economic
                        aggressiveness; with us, through our traditional ties; and with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. He agreed that the Japanese are volatile
                        and that neither the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> nor we should try
                        to inflame the situation in our dealings with Tokyo. I believe <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> appreciated the themes I struck in
                        Japan, i.e. that we favor Sino-Japanese normalization and that we are not
                        encouraging a Japanese military role. But I was careful not to give him too
                        much reassurance about Tokyo's future intentions.</p>
                    <p>In saying that we did not object to better relations between Tokyo and
                        Peking, I emphasized that both the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> must show restraint vis-a-vis the Japanese. If we were to
                        compete in Japan, the U.S. would win out in the short-term, but the eventual
                        result would be increased nationalism. We had to keep that country in
                        emotional balance. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> did not demur;
                        he stated that Japan is at a crossroads and has not decided on its future
                        course.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s views have evolved on Korea as
                        well. Although he maintained the principle of U.S. withdrawal, he indicated
                        that we should keep our troops there for some time in order to keep out
                        Japanese forces. I said that Korea was one area where Japan felt clear
                        security implications; an aggressive North Korea was likely to stir Japanese
                        involvement in the peninsula.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> and I agreed that increasing
                        contacts between the two Koreas was a positive development and that we both
                        should restrain our partners. He said that unification of the two Koreas
                        should be peaceful and would take time. Despite my suggestion that we avoid
                        public debate so as not to poison the atmosphere, between the Koreas and
                        between the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and ourselves, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> made it clear that they would push the
                        Korean issue and the abolition of UNCURK in the UN this fall. Accordingly, I
                        think we can expect some “cannons of rhetoric” in New York on this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Even in Southeast Asia, our greatest present friction point, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> painted the possibility of converging
                            U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> interests. He indicated the
                        need for tacit cooperation to counter Moscow's and New Delhi's pressures.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> saw some encouraging
                        longer-run signs such as the recent <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>
                        meeting in Korea which welcomed your moves toward the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and suggested a willingness to break out of
                        a narrow ideological posture. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        urged a buffer zone of neutrality and relaxed tensions in the region; if the
                        U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> showed restraint and opposed
                        outside intervention it would be difficult for other powers to intrude with
                        outside influence. His basic <pb n="12" xml:id="d147-12" facs="d147-12"/>pitch was that the Vietnam war remains the “single knot” in the region. It
                        affects many other issues - the turmoil in Southeast Asia itself, Taiwan,
                        Korean tensions, the future of Japan. If we could just untie this knot, he
                        implied our two countries could play a constructive role in encouraging and
                        safeguading a Southeast Asian zone of neutrality and independence.</p>
                    <p>I replied that we were not opposed to the concept of neutrality over the long
                        run but the reality of this concept was crucial. There must be safeguards
                        against hegemonial designs.</p>
                    <p>South Asia is the area where U.S. and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        interests have been parallel since last July. The Chinese dislike for India
                        ranks only behind the Soviet Union. While Peking cannot fear New Delhi per
                        se, it is apprehensive about its being used as a tool of Soviet
                        encirclement. This accounts for its consistent support of conservative
                        military regimes in Islamabad and its opposition to Bangladesh independence
                        where one might have expected a Chinese ideological affinity.</p>
                    <p>The U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> convergence of interests in the
                        subcontinent was reconfirmed in our conversations. I pointedly recalled your
                        strong actions versus Moscow last fall when you risked a major confrontation
                        to save West Pakistan. When I mentioned that we had expected military moves
                        by the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was somewhat defensive, pointing out that poor
                        Pakistani military strategy had crumpled East Pakistan before any outside
                        help would have done any good. He noted that Yahya had dispersed his forces
                        too thinly; and he revealed that two divisions of Chinese military equipment
                        had been lost without a fight.</p>
                    <p>Against this background, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> agreed
                        with our view that an independent Pakistan should be supported against
                        Indian pressures, absorbing New Delhi's energy in the subcontinent so it
                        couldn't expand into Southeast Asia. New Delhi was meddling in such areas as
                        Nepal and Ceylon, <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> said. He said
                        that the Indians were putting out feelers for better relations which the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would ignore. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> will maintain its military aid to
                        Islamabad; he said they could give more once the Indochina was was over.
                        They will go very slowly on Bangladesh recognition, but saw advantages in
                        our diplomatic relations so as not to leave the field free to Moscow and New
                        Delhi.</p>
                    <p>I reiterated the theme of the extension of Soviet influence through New
                        Delhi. We had and would continue to supply economic aid but because of <pb n="13" xml:id="d147-13" facs="d147-13"/>Congressional problems looked to
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> for military aid. I noted our
                        efforts with Iran and Turkey to the same end, which <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> approved. Under your Administration, I
                        said, our policy toward Pakistan would continue. In addition we would honor
                        our commitments to Iran and Turkey and would welcome better relations with
                        Ceylon (Mrs. Bandaranaike was due in Peking June 24).</p>
                    <p>In sum, I see no early change in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s
                        policy toward South Asia. The one place that will bear watching, however, is
                        Bangladesh,where the Chinese might ferment trouble against the present
                        rulers.</p>
                    <p>Bilateral Contacts</p>
                    <p>There were also counterpart talks relating to bilateral exchanges and trade,
                        conducted on our side by a State Department representative and members of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff. I set the stage for these
                        discussions in my first meeting with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> where I noted the Soviet strategy of signing the
                        maximum number of agreements with us, as well as pursuing encirclement of
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. It was in both sides' interest to
                        step up U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> contacts in order to show
                        increasing mutual stakes in our relationship (and in their case to lessen
                        their isolation).</p>
                    <p>At the counterpart meetings our side stated that sustained momentum in
                        exchanges and trade, in the spirit and substance of the Shanghai Communique,
                        would serve both countries' interest; we were not interested in this for
                        domestic political reasons or for the intrinsic economic value but rather
                        because of the political and psychological dimension. We were flexible on
                        mechanisms, but visibility was important because the American people had to
                        be conditioned to dealings with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> for
                        us to be able to take more fundamental steps at some future time.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese expressed appreciation for both the substance and the spirit of
                        our presentation. They assured us they wanted steady movement, but it would
                        have to be gradual at first because of their limitations both in experience
                        and in competent personnel. Remaining political problems prevented use of
                        certain types of mechanisms during our present stage of transition. Some
                        exchange proposals which we made could be implemented in the near future but
                        others would take longer. Exchanges in sports were easy. They were
                        considering sending medical generalists and other scientists to the U.S.,
                        and, recalling your offer to Chou, cancer research was of particular
                        interest. There were possibilities also in the fields of <pb n="14" xml:id="d147-14" facs="d147-14"/>environmental control, meterology,
                        agriculture, marine science and chemistry.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese emphasized that they wanted to avoid “accidents” in our
                        developing relations as much as we did; thus the two governments should keep
                        each other informed on visits of significance. They prefer to, continue
                        direct contact with specific organizations in line with the
                        “people-topeople” emphasis, but agreed to a helpful “sideline” role for
                        facilitating organizations having the confidence of the U. S. Government as
                        well as use of the Paris channel, and Washington. They assured us that their
                        Ambassador to France, Huang Chen, who was present at social occasions, will
                        return to Paris in July after French Foreign Minister Schuman's visit to the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>While we suggested mechanisms such as joint commissions, so as to afford
                        greater coordination of exchanges and trade-related problems, the Chinese
                        for political reasons are unwilling during this “transitional stage” to go
                        that far. They want to play up the people-to-people theme, but they are now
                        more impressed with the importance of fairly close governmental supervision.
                        I think we can expect steady, if unspectacular, progress in implementing
                        these aspects of the Shanghai Communique.</p>
                    <p>The American Scene</p>
                    <p>At the closing session I made our standard low-key pitch on the American
                        prisoner, Downey. I asked for clemency, especially in view of his mother's
                        advanced age, while not disputing the justice of the case. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> recalled your appeal and once again
                        took note of our approach. He then sent out for word on Downey's condition,
                        and we were later informed that he is in “Good health and good spirits; no
                        chronic diseases.” (I am calling his family.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> showed considerable interest in
                        our domestic scene; indeed he lingered on in the last evening meeting with
                        inquiries on various American personalities and forces. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was never offensive, and his curosity
                        provided me openings to make several useful points. These included repeated
                        assurances that you would easily win reelection; that <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>'s base was inherently limited;
                        that other countries (including the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>)
                        should not meddle in our internal affairs; that we would like to see the
                        Chinese continue their practice of not inviting opposition candidates to the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>; that it would be helpful to keep
                        the rhetoric down at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this fall; and
                        that the conservative wings <pb n="15" xml:id="d147-15" facs="d147-15"/>of
                        the two U.S. political parties still represented a potent anti-communist
                        force if they ever linked up.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion</p>
                    <p>The conversations were extremely relaxed and candid. At times <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> was asking advice in a manner that we
                        wouldn't even expect our allies to do. The Chinese clearly put a higher
                        priority on their national concerns, especially over the Soviet Union, and
                        their implications for their global policy, than their ideological
                        brotherhood with Hanoi. However, the personal and fraternal loyalties make
                        for sensitive nerves; we will have to be careful not to challenge Peking too
                        directly on this issue, either with our planes or our pronouncements.</p>
                    <p>It is also abundantly clear that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> does
                        not make policy on sentimental grounds. They need us. But if they become
                        convinced that we cannot deliver what they want—a resolute counter to Moscow
                        in strength and will—they could turn brutally against us. They would make a
                        formidable opponent.</p>
                    <p>There are danger points. Vietnam could still get out of hand. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> noted, for example, that Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> had ordered that their
                        protests over intrusions be kept private so as to minimize frictions.
                        However, the next incident would be considered a “political matter” and
                        would be publicized. In addition, the Taiwan question might not move fast
                        enough for them, their restraint to date notwithstanding. Incidents which
                        seem minor to us can loom large in their perspective. A case in point is the
                        reference to both the “People's Republic of China” and the “Republic of
                        China” on one page of your article in “U.S. News and World Report.” This
                        smacks of a two-China policy to Peking, and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> referred to the article on three or four separate
                        occasions. A similar note was struck in their request that we change the
                        Intelsat directory which now lists two Chinas.</p>
                    <p>Such concerns presumably prompted an interjection by <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> while we were cruising on a boat at the
                        Summer Palace the last evening. Having just indicated an interest in my
                        returning to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, he suddenly stated
                        that we would have “to make efforts” before such a visit were feasible. In
                        response to my question that, he said that he meant we would have to do more
                        to normalize our relations. This rather somber note frankly jarred with the
                        mood of the overall visit. I take it as <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>'s reminder, which we hardly need, that we cannot take
                        for granted their patience on fundamental issues.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d147-16" facs="d147-16"/>
                    <p>In sum, the trip was extremely useful. These direct talks with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> are the only way really to get a feel
                        for Chinese perspectives, intentions, and policies. Similarly, they are the
                        only means to give him your authoritative views. We now have a better mutual
                        appreciation of each other's global strategy as well as tactical moves. We
                        manageed somewhat to defuse Vietnam, where our intrusions were beginning to
                        get under their political skin. We deepened Hanoi's paranoia and isolation
                        by the fact of my visit and the June 24 announcement which talks of the
                        “usefulness” of these contacts and the “desirability” of continuing them. We
                        have hopefully imparted some additional momentum to our exchange programs
                        and trade. And by striking a businesslike, but not effusive tone, we have
                        helped to keep the pressure on Moscow without alienating the Soviet Union or
                        shocking Japan or panicking Taiwan.</p>

                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Friday, August 4, 1972 - 5:15-6:45 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: New York City</p>
                    <p>(There were some opening pleasantries, including Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s favorable remarks on the
                        Ambassador's light-weight, light grey Chinese outfit.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I saw Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> this morning. You scared
                        him about Korea. You intimidated him. We will have to give him more
                        backbone.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: (Immediately pulling
                        out a piece of paper and reading from it.) Following our talk last time, I
                        would like to express the following views regarding the primary point of the
                        message of July 26 given by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, that is the idea that the United States and the
                        Soviet Union sign a treaty on a mutual nuclear nonaggression.</p>
                    <p>“First, the Chinese side considers the Soviet proposal to be nakedly aimed at
                        the establishment of nuclear world hegemony.</p>
                    <p>“Secondly, the Soviet proposal only stipulates that the Soviet Union and the
                        United States should not use nuclear weapons against each other or their
                        allies. This is obviously an attempt, following the Partial Nuclear Test Ban
                        Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to go a step further and
                        monopolize nuclear weapons, maintain nuclear superiority and make nuclear
                        threats against countries <pb n="2" xml:id="d148-02" facs="d148-02"/>with
                        few nuclear weapons, non-nuclear countries, and countries in which the
                        production of nuclear weapons is barred, and force them into spheres of
                        influence of either this or that hegemony so that the two hegemonies may
                        have a free hand in dividing up the world and manipulating the destinies of
                        countries of the world at will.</p>
                    <p>“It is impermissible for such an agreement to be concluded between the Soviet
                        Union and the United States. It is likewise impermissible for such an
                        agreement to be concluded among all the nuclear countries.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: “It is impermissible
                        among all nuclear countries?”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih: The same, either between the Soviet Union and the United States,
                        or all nuclear countries.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: (Resuming his
                        reading):</p>
                    <p>“Should an agreement be concluded, how will there be any equality between all
                        countries of the world, big or small? This is what China categorically will
                        not agree to. Should the Soviet Union brazenly advance this proposal, it
                        will arouse extensive opposition and condemnation throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>“Point 3. We hope the United States will value principle jointly affirmed by
                        China and the United States in the Shanghai Communique that it would be
                        against the interests of the peoples of the world for any major countries to
                        collude with another against other countries, or for major countries to
                        divide up the world into spheres of interest, and reject the Soviet
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>“Point 4. The U.S. is aware of the entire position of the Chinese government
                        on nuclear weapons. The Chinese side has consistently stood for the
                        conclusion of an agreement on the complete prohibition and thorough
                        destruction of nuclear weapons through consultations by all countries and as
                        a first step, reaching an agreement on the non-use of nuclear weapons. Not
                        only should nuclear countries not use nuclear weapons against each other,
                        but what is more important, nuclear countries should not use nuclear weapons
                        against non-nuclear countries. Only such an agreement will be just and can
                        really solve the problem.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d148-03" facs="d148-03"/>
                    <p>“We hope that the U.S. side will give serious consideration to this.”</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, I have two other items to discuss.</p>
                    <p>(He pulls out another piece of paper and reads):</p>
                    <p>“The Chinese side expressed the following views with regard to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s July 26 message on the Korean
                        question.</p>
                    <p>“The so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and
                        Rehabilitation of Korea, and the United Nations Military Command stationed
                        in South Korea are both products created more than 20 years ago during the
                        Cold War period. Over all these years they have served as obstacles to the
                        realization of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, and the
                        majority of United Nations member states have long been unwilling to be
                        associated with them.</p>
                    <p>“Since North and South Korea have expressed, in their July 4 joint statement,
                        their desire to realize peaceful reunification without the interference of
                        outside forces, it is even more unjustified for these two organizations to
                        continue their existence.</p>
                    <p>“Now Algeria and other countries have proposed that the Korean question be
                        put on the agenda of the coming session of the United Nations General
                        Assembly, and this proposal has won the support of China and many other
                        countries. This indicates the general trend in the international
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>“As U.S. side has repeatedly stated that it is for the relaxation of tension
                        in the Korean peninsula and that it supports increased communication between
                        North and South Korea, it should really be in favor, or at least not be
                        opposed to, the reasonable proposal put forward by Algeria and other
                        countries. We hope the U.S. side will reconsider its idea of postponing
                        discussion of the Korea question until the 28th Session of the United
                        Nations General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>“In our view, if the U.S. side takes the idea of sailing with the tide, the
                        discussion of the question this year will not necessarily lead to
                        confrontation between the U.S. and other countries. Otherwise, it is indeed
                        possible that such a situation would appear from the very beginning.”</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d148-04" facs="d148-04"/>
                    <p>Above is the message on the Korean question. I have two other short messages
                        for you.</p>
                    <p>(Again reading):</p>
                    <p>“First, the Chinese side appreciates Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s indication of a desire to promote contact
                        between China and West Germany. During Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>'s visit to China, he conducted useful talks with
                        the Chinese side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                        expressed the desire of various quarters concerned in West Germany for the
                        establishment of diplomatic relations with China at an early date, and the
                        Chinese side responded positvely to this. As the West Germany government has
                        no relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it is possible for China to
                        establish diplomatic relations with West Germany.”</p>
                    <p>The second short message is that:</p>
                    <p>“During <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName>'s visit to
                        five countries of Europe and Africa he met no accident with regard to his
                        security. Considering the fact that the U.S. side indicated its willingness
                        to do something for the security of the Prince during his visit in other
                        countries, the Chinese side is glad to inform the U.S. side of this.”</p>
                    <p>That is all I have about the messages.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thank you. I appreciate
                        this very much. Let me ask first about the Korea item. You say if we agree
                        to a debate, a confrontation can be avoided. I don't understand this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: What is said in the
                        message (reading):</p>
                    <p>“If the U.S. side takes the idea of sailing with the tide, the discussion of
                        the question this year will not necessarily lead to confrontation between
                        the U.S. and other countries.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we agree with your
                        proposal!</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: (Looking at his
                        message) If the U.S. side takes a stand consistent with its repeated stand
                        that it is in favor of a relaxation of tension in the Korean peninsula and
                        increased contact, communication, between North and South Korea, if it takes
                        this attitude—favorable or at least not opposing Algeria and the other
                        countries—then this would not lead to a confrontation as the U.S. is worried
                        about.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d148-05" facs="d148-05"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not worried that
                        there may be a confrontation if we agree to your proposal! It would be very
                        embarrassing to us if under Chinese leadership this year certain measures
                        were taken which are embarrassing to our allies. This is our difficulty.
                        (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pours a cup of tea for
                        the Ambassador.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I don't see any
                        difficulty in this question. One question is the United Nations Commission
                        for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, and most people have long
                        ceased to support it. So, needless to say, its continued presence will be an
                        obstacle to the realization of the principles stated in the joint statement
                        of North and South Korea for the independent, peaceful reunification of
                        Korea. And as I said last time, the United Nations Military Command is
                        something very ridiculous.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We told you last time
                        that if a debate is avoided, we would bring about the disbandment of UNCURK
                        before the next General Assembly. So the practical result will not be
                        extremely different from what you were saying. We do not want to be
                        maneuvered into a position of being forced to do something that we might be
                        prepared to do voluntarily and that one of our allies objects to very
                        strenuously when it comes in this particular fashion.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: It is our view that
                        it is appropriate to discuss the Korean question at the 27th Session of the
                        General Assembly, and we hope, as stated in our message, (again reading)
                        “that the U.S. side will reconsider its idea of postponing discussion of the
                        Korean question until the 28th Session of the General Assembly.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your view,
                        and I will let you know our decision next week. I am practically certain
                        that we cannot reconsider it, and we think we made a reasonable proposal to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>I'll have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName> get in
                        touch with you next week. The Chinese side should have some understanding
                        for the particular difficulty that we face, this year in particular.</p>
                    <p>Now on the German question … . there are a number of things I want to talk to
                        you about with respect to the nuclear issue, but I want to save that till
                        the last because it will take a little longer.</p>

                    <p>I have a direct channel to the German Chancellor which does not go through
                        the diplomatic line.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: The Chancellor?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Chancellor Brandt. He
                        is the Chancellor's assistant for Foreign Policy, who has roughly the same
                        job I do for the President. He has asked my opinion about the establishment
                        of diplomatic relations between Peking and Bonn. He has stated as his own
                        personal opinion that he thinks there is no enormous hurry and that the
                        weight of Germany's interests is in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Now I am considering what reply to give to him. We know from certain
                        information that <persName corresp="#p_BE5">Bahr</persName>—that's the name
                        of the man—is very close to the Soviet Union, and he reports almost every
                        conversation to the Soviet contact that he has. So I have to be somewhat
                        careful in my reply. But as I told you I may be in Germany early in
                        September and I can talk to Brandt directly.</p>
                    <p>As for us, we are in favor of diplomatic relations between the Federal
                        Republic and the People's Republic. The question is whether you want to
                        establish those before the general elections which are in December—December
                        3, he tells me in his cable; December 3, it hasn't been announced yet—and to
                        what extent you want to deal with this group.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: We haven't gotten
                        specific instructions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course. I will give
                        him a non-commital reply until I hear from you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: The message indicates
                        (looking at it) that during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>'s visit to China he indicated the desire of
                        various quarters of West Germany for the establishment of diplomatic
                        relations at an early date and the Chinese side responded positively.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The question now is the
                        definition of “early date.” I am prepared, if you want, to indicate to the
                        Germans that you are prepared to do this, but perhaps you will let me know.
                        I will have to do this through a channel other than him.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d148-07" facs="d148-07"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih: What?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Through someone other
                        than Bahr because Bahr will report it immediately to the Soviet Union. But
                        if you have any views, you let me know, and I will wait for a reply.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: And from the fact
                        that West Germany doesn't have any relations with the <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang kai-shek</persName> clique we can see that there
                        will be less difficulty than with other countries which have diplomatic
                        relations with <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well it is primarily a
                        tactical question, whether you want to wait until December 3 or whether you
                        want the preliminary steps to be taken now, and whether you will want to
                        concentrate on dealing with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                        and his friends, or whether you will also want to open communications with
                        the other party. I will reply only in a general way and simply say that I
                        have always found you very honorable to deal with, without indicating
                        anything on the timing. And I will say I will be in touch with him later
                        when I have had a chance to think about it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Well, Doctor, when
                        are you going to Europe?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am planning to go in
                        the first week in September.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Huang Well, we can report your views to Peking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, I go now
                        occasionally for Vietnamese discussions, and it's easy to go to Bonn from
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Now let me talk to you about the nuclear issue. First of all, we agree with
                        the general analysis you have presented, although we, of course, cannot
                        accept the motives you have ascribed to us. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> corrects Mrs. Shih on the word
                        “ascribe.”) Because if those were our motives we wouldn't consult with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Let me give you our analysis of the situation and of the strategy we intend
                        to pursue, and then we can talk about this. Our analysis is that there is a
                        deliberate Soviet policy to isolate you, and that the many agreements the
                        Soviet Union has made in the last two years and the patience they have shown
                        in the face of setbacks in the West, can only be explained to us in terms of
                        aggressive intent in the East. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> questions Mrs. Shih on something.) This is our
                        analysis. We believe the period of greatest <pb n="8" xml:id="d148-08" facs="d148-08"/>danger in this respect is likely to come in the period
                        1974-76. We believe also that it is against our interests to permit the
                        establishment of an hegemony in Eurasia dominated from Moscow. And
                        therefore, it is in our interest to resist this without any formal agreement
                        [with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>] simply out of our own
                        necessity.</p>
                    <p>Now the problem is how to accomplish this. We cannot artifically maintain
                        tensions in the West when our allies pursue the policies they do, and when
                        we have no direct interest in tensions in the West.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: You mean you don't
                        have a direct interest in the West?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In tension in the West.
                        We have no interest in maintaining tension in the West, but we have an
                        interest in maintaining our position in the West. And if we remain in
                        office, we shall not reduce our forces in Europe unilaterally, and as I told
                        the Prime Minister, even by agreement we will not reduce them by much more
                        than 10 percent.</p>
                    <p>But what we have to try to accomplish before that time period that I
                        mentioned to you is to establish enough of a relationship with you so that
                        it is plausible that an attack on you involves a substantial American
                        interest. And you would make a great mistake if you thought that we had
                        primarily commercial interests, because with this Administration at least,
                        that's of a third order of interest. Our basic strategy is what I mentioned
                        to you. In order to have a plausible basis and in order avoid giving the
                        Soviet Union the pretense of claiming that they are being encircled, we want
                        to do enough with the Soviet Union to maintain a formal symmetry.
                        (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> checks Mrs. Shih's
                        translation, then smiles and indicates that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> should continue. )</p>
                    <p>It is a very complicated policy, but it is a very complicated situation. And
                        we will not participate in any agreements that have the objective tendency
                        of isolating you, or can be directed at you. But what we are looking for is
                        to find some formulation that deprives this proposal of its substantive
                        content but gives it some general abstract qualities, that gives it no
                        operational significance. We have not yet replied, so I am telling you our
                        thinking.</p>
                    <p>For example—I want to tell you this is an internal paper which we are
                        considering now—we are playing with the idea of a proposal that in the <pb n="9" xml:id="d148-09" facs="d148-09"/>first paragraph, when they say
                        there is an obligation not to use nuclear weapons against each other, we
                        might say we agree to do the utmost to create conditions in international
                        relations in which nuclear weapons are not used by anybody. And then have a
                        second paragraph which says that in order for this condition to be realized,
                        there cannot be either a threat or the use of force by one side against the
                        other, by one side against the allies of the other, or by either side
                        against a third country. And furthermore, that neither side will encourage
                        the threat or use of force by any of its allies or by any other third
                        country.</p>
                    <p>We have not submitted this, and we are debating it. This makes it very
                        general. It isn't confined to nuclear countries and it isn't an obligation.
                        If you have any views, we would welcome them. And I said, we have not
                        responded and we will certainly not accept the proposal I mentioned to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: The Chinese side's
                        attitude is very clearly stated in the first message (looking at the
                        message), that is, the Chinese side hopes the U.S. side will give serious
                        consideration to the Chinese side's proposal that an agreement on the
                        complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons will be
                        reached through the consultation of all countries. (Repeating) … through the
                        consultation of all countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your
                        point.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: (Looking at the
                        message) As a first step, an agreement should be reached on the non-use of
                        nuclear weapons by nuclear countries against each other and by nuclear
                        countries against non-nuclear countries. We would consider that only such an
                        agreement is correct and would really solve the problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand this point
                        and it is not inconsistent with our views.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Do you think the
                        Soviet side will accept such a proposal? What is the possibility?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (Pausing) Will they
                        accept such an agreement?</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You made it before.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: At the session of the
                        General Assemply last year, we reaffirmed our statement on this question and
                        asked Mr. <persName>Malik</persName> to reply, and <pb n="10" xml:id="d148-10" facs="d148-10"/>he didn't. In the past, the Soviet side
                        had proposed a similar view, similar proposals.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I can't judge. I doubt
                        it, but I can't be sure.</p>
                    <p>You can be certain that you will be informed of every step that is taken in
                        this matter before it is taken.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: And does the U.S.
                        side agree to our proposal?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (Pausing): We are
                        trying to avoid a situation where the Soviet Union can threaten our allies
                        with conventional forces, and we are then prohibited from using nuclear
                        weapons in defense of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Because the Chinese
                        proposal for the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is not an
                        isolated step. It is proposed as a first step.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is our principal
                        concern, the Soviet military concentration in Europe which none of our
                        allies are capable of resisting themselves.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Huang Well, I hope when the U.S. side has considered this
                        question, you will let us know.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You can be certain. We
                        will not make any move which you are not aware of and have not had a chance
                        to make a comment on. You can assure the Prime Minister now that we will not
                        accept the Soviet proposal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I will report this to the Premier.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wanted to mention two
                        other things to you. I have also with respect to the British the same
                        confidential channel that I have with respect to the Germans. I met last
                        week with Sir Burke Trend who is the British Cabinet Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Burt?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Burke. B-u-r-k-e Trend.
                        I gave him most of the same analysis that I have given to you about the
                        Soviet intentions, and about our interest in preventing the situation from
                        arising. He told me that the British Foreign Secretary will visit Peking in
                        October.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d148-11" facs="d148-11"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: October.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we will invite him
                        to Washington before he goes so that we can continue the conversation; we
                        have reason to believe that the general British approach is sympathetic. You
                        have to do a little missionary work about their Indian friends with them. He
                        gave us a lot of trouble last year on India-Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>A second thing I wanted to tell you … .</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> (Interrupting) Just a
                        matter for clarification. You said that you have an interest in avoiding
                        this situation. Was this sentence directed against the Soviet's proposal?
                        You said “avoid this situation.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are interested in
                        trying to avoid a situation of Soviet aggressive actions in East Asia. We
                        also discussed the Soviet proposal with them, but we have not yet received
                        their reaction. We discussed this in somewhat less detail than with you. But
                        those are the only two countries that I have discussed it with.</p>
                    <p>As you know, I had another meeting with the North Vietnamese … .</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> (Interrupting) I had
                        another question—sorry.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have another
                        question?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Would you elaborate
                        on your view that the greatest danger is the period 1974-76?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is my impression
                        that it will take until then, or maybe just before then, to complete the
                        pacification of the West, the European Security Conference and maybe some
                        more progress in disarmament, and the shift of military forces.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: So when the European
                        Security Conference and disarmament will make some progress … .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and when it has
                        established a basically peaceful intent or reputation has been established,
                        and their military buildup is completed. One reason is that there are new
                        nuclear weapons introduced which will not be completed until 1974.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Shih: You mean nuclear weapons introduced … ?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the strategic
                        forces. They are more directed against us.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Directed against
                        you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Some. I don't want you
                        to think you are in a monopoly position in receiving all the attention. The
                        strategic forces to keep us … are directed mostly against us, some against
                        you, but they are mostly against us.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I thank you for the
                        clarification.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't want to mislead
                        you. This is our interpretation in the White House. Not everybody agrees
                        with it. If you get a change of Administrations they would take a less
                        cataclysmic view of the probable evolution.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih: What?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our opponent in the
                        campaign takes a different view as you probably know.</p>
                    <p>* * * * *</p>
                    <p>As you know, we had another meeting with the North Vietnamese this week. We
                        made a particular proposal which I introduced with a special opening
                        statement. I thought the Prime Minister for his information would like to
                        read it.</p>
                    <p>It is our view that the only thing that could hold up a solution now is their
                        attempt to play on our domestic politics. We are prepared to settle on a
                        reasonable and just basis. I think you will find some points that were made
                        to us were taken very seriously.</p>
                    <p>(He hands over the proposal and opening statement at Tabs A and B
                        respectively.) This is simply for your information. We are not asking for
                        any particular … . (Pointing to the documents) This is the statement I made
                        when I presented it. This was the formal proposal by us. It follows the
                        outline of their seven points.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: That finishes our
                        work?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>(There were then some closing pleasantries while the Ambassador waited for
                        his car. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned that
                        he received many requests from people wishing to make movies in China, such
                        as documentaries or landscape films. For example, Bob Hope, a good friend of
                        the Administration, had just asked for help with his request to shoot
                        background shots of China for a show. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> inquired whether these should be sent to Ottawa
                        with a copy to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> in New
                        York, or how else to handle these matters. He said that he would not get
                        involved in these cases very often, but occasionally just to indicate to the
                        Chinese that it would be nice if certain people got a personal response. It
                        did not mean that the U.S. Government or he necessarily endorsed the
                        initiatives, and the response could be negative. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> said that in Mr. Hope's case, he could
                        either write to him directly or write to Ottawa and send a copy to him.</p>
                    <p>There was some other light conversation until the Ambassador's car arrived.
                        He and Mrs. Shih then departed.)</p>

                    <p>1. Regarding the withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign forces allied with the
                        Government of South Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>There will be a total withdrawal from South Vietnam of all U.S. troops,
                        military advisors and military personnel and those of other forces allied
                        with the Government of South Vietnam within four months of the signature of
                        this general agreement. Weapons and war materials belonging to those forces
                        will also be withdrawn and bases under U.S. control will be dismantled.</p>
                    <p>2. There will be a general cease-fire throughout Indochina, to begin when
                        this general agreement is signed. The cease-fire will include cessation of
                        United States acts of force against North Vietnam, the mining of North
                        Vietnamese ports and harbors, and an end to all U.S. air and other military
                        activities in South Vietnam. As part of the cease-fire, there will be no
                        further infiltration of outside forces into any of the countries of
                        Indochina, and the introduction into Indochina of reinforcements in the form
                        of arms, munitions and other war material will be prohibited. It is
                        understood, however, that war material, arms and munitions which have been
                        destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cessation of hostilities
                        may <pb n="15" xml:id="d148-15" facs="d148-15"/>be replaced on the basis of
                        piece-for-piece of the same type and with similar characteristics.</p>
                    <p>3. The release of all military men and innocent civilians captured throughout
                        Indochina will be carried out in parallel with the troop withdrawals
                        mentioned in Point 1. Both sides will present a complete list of military
                        men and innocent civilians held throughout Indochina on the day this general
                        agreement is signed. The release will begin on the same day as troop
                        withdrawals and will be completed when they are completed.</p>
                    <p>4. Regarding the political problem in South Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>The political future of South Vietnam will be left for the South Vietnamese
                        people to decide for themselves, free from outside interference.</p>
                    <p>For its part, the United States declares that it respects the South
                        Vietnamese people's night to self-determination; it will remain completely
                        neutral with respect to the political process in South Vietnam; it will
                        abide by the outcome of any political process shaped by the South Vietnamese
                        people themselves; and it is prepared to define its military and economic
                        assistance relationship with any government that exists in South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="d148-16" facs="d148-16"/>
                    <p>There will be a free and democratic Presidential election in South Vietnam no
                        later than six months from the date of final agreement on the details of a
                        political solution. The election may be held earlier if that is agreed among
                        the parties. This election will be organized and run by an independent body
                        representing all political forces in South Vietnam which will assume its
                        responsibilities on the date of final agreement on the details of a
                        political solution. This body will, among other responsibilities, determine
                        the qualification of candidates. All political forces in South Vietnam can
                        participate in the election and present candidates. There will be
                        international supervision of this election.</p>
                    <p>Before the Presidential election takes place, the incumbent President and
                        Vice President of South Vietnam will resign. The Chairman of the Senate, as
                        caretaker head of the government, will assume administrative
                        responsibilities except for those pertaining to the election, which will
                        remain with the independent election body.</p>
                    <p>The right of all political forces to participate freely and peacefully in
                        every aspect of the political process will be guaranteed. In addition to the
                        Presidential election, all political forces will be eligible for appointment
                        or election to positions in the executive, legislative and judicial branches
                        of government.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d148-17" facs="d148-17"/>
                    <p>In keeping with the provisions of Article 14 (C) of the 1954 Geneva Accords
                        the Vietnamese parties will undertake to refrain from any reprisals or
                        discrimination against persons or organizations on account of their
                        activities during the hostilities and to guarantee democratic liberties.</p>
                    <p>5. After the new President has been elected, the political forces in South
                        Vietnam will meet with a view to revising the Constitution within one year
                        and agreeing on steps to implement it.</p>
                    <p>6. The details of a political solution based on the principles of Points 4
                        and 5 above will be negotiated between the South Vietnamese parties within
                        three months of the signature of this general agreement.</p>
                    <p>7. Regarding the peaceful reunification of Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>Reunification of Vietnam will be achieved step by step by peaceful means, on
                        the basis of discussions and agreements between North and South Vietnam
                        without constraint and annexation from either party, and without foreign
                        interference.</p>
                    <p>Pending reunification, and in keeping with the provisions of the 1954 Geneva
                        Agreements on Vietnam, North and South Vietnam will refrain from Joining any
                        military alliance with foreign countries, and from allowing any foreign
                        country to have military bases, troops and military personnel on their
                        soil.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="d148-18" facs="d148-18"/>
                    <p>Pending reunification, North and South Vietnam will develop and maintain
                        close relations in all fields.</p>
                    <p>8. Regarding the foreign policy of peace and neutrality of Indochina:</p>
                    <p>The countries of Indochina shall pursue a foreign policy of peace,
                        independence and neutrality, establish relations with all countries
                        regardless of their political and social regime, maintain economic and
                        cultural relations with all countries, and participate in programs of
                        regional economic cooperation.</p>
                    <p>9. Both sides will respect the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina and those
                        of 1961 on Laos. There will be no foreign intervention in the Indochinese
                        countries and the Indochinese peoples will be left to settle their own
                        affairs by themselves.</p>
                    <p>10. The problems existing among the Indochinese countries will be settled by
                        the Indochinese parties on the basis of mutual respect for independence,
                        sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
                        affairs. Among the problems that will be settled is the implementation of
                        the principle that all armed forces of the countries of Indochina must
                        remain within their national frontiers.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d148-19" facs="d148-19"/>
                    <p>11. There will be international supervision of the military aspects of this
                        agreement, including the cease-fire and its provisions, the release of
                        prisoners of war and innocent civilians, the withdrawal of outside forces
                        from Indochina, and the implementation of the principle that all armed
                        forces of the countries of Indochina must remain within their national
                        frontiers.</p>
                    <p>12. There will be an international guarantee for the fundamental national
                        rights of the Indochinese peoples, the status of all the countries of
                        Indochina, and lasting peace in the region.</p>
                    <p>Both sides express their willingness to participate in an international
                        conference for this and other appropriate purposes.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Special Adviser, Mr. Minister —</p>
                    <p>When we adjourned on July 19 we agreed that both sides would study the record
                        and formulate new concrete proposals. We agreed as well at that meeting that
                        we should both make an effort to find a solution, meet each other part way,
                        and put our proposals side-by-side, with the attitude of finding a
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>We approach this session in this spirit. We have closely reviewed your
                        remarks at our last meeting, as well as all your earlier statements and
                        proposals. The President has authorized me to introduce a concrete new plan.
                        I look forward to hearing the new proposals you have promised. We can then
                        compare the two sides positions to reconcile them.</p>
                    <p>The time has come to replace rhetoric with reasonableness, to move from
                        debating points and propaganda to a joint search for a settlement. Two weeks
                        ago, the Special Adviser said that in negotiations “you cannot win
                        everything you put forward, as we cannot win everything we put forward.” If
                        that approach can be translated into action, here, we can rapidly reach a
                        settlement. It will be our approach.</p>
                    <p>As I said last time, I am here to meet in a spirit of conciliation and good
                        will, prepared to forego unilateral demands, ready to look understandingly
                        at your point of view. If you choose to negotiate in the same spirit you
                        will find us both forthcoming and reliable. The Special Adviser asked last
                        time whether you could be sure that we will keep the agreements that we may
                        make. I want to tell you as solemnly as I am able that you can. We will
                        maintain every agreement we make with you, not only in letter but also in
                        spirit. We will abide by the consequences of whatever process we jointly
                        start here.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we are prepared to give the same guarantee to your allies as to
                        you. We are willing to link our important relations in Moscow and Peking to
                        our good faith in Indochina. You would thus have as guarantee not only our
                        word to you but the force of American interest in its global diplomacy. Let
                        me explain, incidentally; we have not discussed this with your allies.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d148-21" facs="d148-21"/>
                    <p>Let me explain in uncomplicated language. If you do not believe our word to
                        you, we are prepared to give the same promises to your allies or any other
                        country you trust. Therefore if we break our promise to you we will also be
                        breaking our promise to them. It is an assurance to you, we do not insist on
                        it. We have not discussed it with your allies. No other country has seen
                        this text.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we are prepared to enter into specific understandings with you
                        on how to interpret certain aspects of an agreement. These, too, will be
                        meticulously observed and can be, if you wish, conveyed to your allies.</p>
                    <p>Now then, to our proposals. We have looked once again at everything you have
                        said, especially regarding the political question. We agree to recognize
                        that military and political issues should be solved together. We have made a
                        serious effort to bridge our differences. For this is the basic barrier to a
                        settlement. We have, as well, added new elements to meet specific points you
                        have raised on other issues. As a demonstration of our good will, we have
                        accepted the basic structure of your Two-Point Elaboration and the
                        Seven-Point Proposal. To speed agreement, we have even adopted much of your
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Now I shall read the plan, and then I shall explain what it means.</p>
                    <p>“Point One, regarding the withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign forces allied
                        with the Government of South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>“There will be a total withdrawal from South Vietnam of all U.S. troops,
                        military advisers and military personnel and those of other forces allied
                        with the Government of South Vietnam within four months of the signature of
                        this general agreement. Weapons and war materials belonging to those forces
                        will also be withdrawn and bases under U.S. control will be dismantled.</p>
                    <p>We will give you a text when we are finished.</p>
                    <p>“Two, there will be a general cease-fire throughout Indochina, to begin when
                        this general agreement is signed. The cease-fire will include cessation of
                        United States acts of force against North <pb n="22" xml:id="d148-22" facs="d148-22"/>Vietnam, the mining of North Vietnamese ports and
                        harbors, and an end to all U.S. air and other military activities in South
                        Vietnam. As part of the cease-fire, there will be no further infiltration of
                        outside forces into any of the countries of Indochina, and the introduction
                        into Indochina of reinforcements in the form of arms, munitions and other
                        war material will be prohibited. It is understood, however, that war
                        material, arms and munitions which have been destroyed, damaged, worn out or
                        used up after the cessation of hostilities may be replaced on the basis of
                        piece-for-piece of the same type and with similar characteristics.</p>
                    <p>“Three, the release of all military men and innocent civilians captured
                        throughout Indochina will be carried out in parallel with the troop
                        withdrawals mentioned in Point 1. Both sides will present a complete list of
                        military men and innocent civilians held throughout Indochina on the day
                        this general agreement is signed. The release will begin on the same day as
                        troop withdrawals and will be completed when they are completed.</p>
                    <p>“Fourth, regarding the political problem in South Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>“The political future of South Vietnam will be left for the South Vietnamese
                        people to decide for themselves, free from outside interference.</p>
                    <p>“For its part, the United States declares that it respects the South
                        Vietnamese people's right to self-determination; it will remain completely
                        neutral with respect to the political process in South Vietnam; it will
                        abide by the outcome of any political process shaped by the South Vietnamese
                        people themselves; and it is prepared to define its military and economic
                        assistance relationship with any government that exists in South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>“There will be a free and democratic Presidential election in South Vietnam
                        no later than six months from the date of final agreement on the details of
                        a political solution. The election may be held earlier if that is agreed
                        among the parties. This election will be organized and run by an independent
                        body representing all political forces in South Vietnam which will assume
                        its responsibilities on the date of final agreement on the details of a
                        political solution. This body will, among other responsibilities, determine
                            <pb n="23" xml:id="d148-23" facs="d148-23"/>the qualification of
                        candidates. All political forces in South Vietnam can participate in the
                        election and present candidates. There will be international supervision of
                        this election.</p>
                    <p>“Before the Presidential election takes place, the incumbent President and
                        Vice President of South Vietnam will resign. The Chairman of the Senate, as
                        caretaker head of the government, will assume administrative
                        responsibilities except for those pertaining to the election, which will
                        remain with the independent election body.</p>
                    <p>“The right of all political forces to participate freely and peacefully in
                        every aspect of the political process will be guaranteed. In addition to the
                        Presidential election, all political forces will be eligible for appointment
                        or election to positions in the executive, legislative and judicial branches
                        of government.</p>
                    <p>“In keeping with the provisions of Article 14(C) of the 1954 Geneva Accords
                        the Vietnamese parties will undertake to refrain from any reprisals or
                        discrimination against persons or organizations on account of their
                        activities during the hostilities and to guarantee democratic liberties.</p>
                    <p>“Five, after the new President has been elected, the political forces in
                        South Vietnam will meet with a view to revising the Constitution within one
                        year and agreeing on steps to implement it.</p>
                    <p>“Point Six: The details of a political solution based on the principles of
                        Points 4 and 5 above will be negotiated between the South Vietnamese parties
                        within three months of the signature of this general agreement.</p>
                    <p>“Point Seven: Regarding the peaceful reunification of Vietnam: Reunification
                        of Vietnam will be achieved step by step by peaceful means on the basis of
                        discussions and agreements between North and South Vietnam without
                        constraint and annexation from either party, and without foreign
                        interference.</p>
                    <p>“Pending reunification, and in keeping with the provisions of the 1954 Geneva
                        Agreements on Vietnam, North and South Vietnam will refrain from joining any
                        military alliance with foreign countries, <pb n="24" xml:id="d148-24" facs="d148-24"/>and from allowing any foreign country to have military
                        bases, troops and military personnel on their soil.</p>
                    <p>“Pending reunification, North and South Vietnam will develop and maintain
                        close relations in all fields.</p>
                    <p>“Eight, regarding the foreign policy of peace and neutrality of
                        Indochina:</p>
                    <p>“The countries of Indochina shall pursue a foreign policy of peace
                        indepedence and neutrality, establish relations with all countries
                        regardless of their political and social regime, maintain economic and
                        cultural relations with all countries, and participate in programs of
                        regional economic cooperation.</p>
                    <p>“Nine, both sides will respect the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina and
                        those of 1962 on Laos. There will be no foreign intervention in the
                        Indochinese countries and the Indochinese peoples will be left to settle
                        their own affairs by themselves.</p>
                    <p>“Ten, the problems existing among the Indochinese countries will be settled
                        by the Indochinese parties on the basis of mutual respect for independence,
                        sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
                        affairs. Among the problems that will be settled is the implementation of
                        the principle that all armed forces of the countries of Indochina must
                        remain within their national frontiers.</p>
                    <p>“Eleven, there will be international supervision of the military aspects of
                        this agreement, including the cease-fire and its provisions, the release of
                        prisoners of war and innocent civilians, the withdrawal of outside forces
                        from Indochina, and the implementation of the principle that all armed
                        forces of the countries of Indochina must remain within their national
                        frontiers.</p>
                    <p>“Twelve, there will be an international guarantee for the fundamental
                        national rights of the Indochinese peoples, the status of all the countries
                        of Indochina, and lasting peace in the region.</p>
                    <p>“Both sides express their willingness to participate in an international
                        conference for this and other appropriate purposes.”</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="d148-25" facs="d148-25"/>
                    <p>Now let me explain what we mean by this plan. Let us look seriously and in
                        good faith at what we have done. We have cast our plan in terms of the
                        Seven-Point Plan and Two-Point Elaboration. We have accepted the basic
                        principles of your proposals, although there are differences with regard to
                        timing and procedure. Let me go through these proposals, point by point.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Point One, on the military questions:</p>
                    <p>— Your side has asked for the complete withdrawal of allied forces and their
                        equipment and the dismantling of U.S. bases. We have agreed that we will do
                        this.</p>
                    <p>— You have asked for an early deadline. We have shortened the timetable for
                        complete withdrawal of our forces to four months. Were we to agree by
                        September 1st, the last American soldier will have left South Vietnam by the
                        end of this year.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Point Two, on the political questions: You will notice that
                        we have accepted many of its principles and that we have agreed to consider
                        it together with the military questions.</p>
                    <p>First, on the overall process. Your position as expressed in the Seven Points
                        and the Two-Point Elaboration is that the present government must change and
                        then the new government should develop a new constitutional structure. We
                        accept this general outline as to procedure, and also the two-stage approach
                        it represents. We have made a conscientious effort to leave the decisions to
                        the South Vietnamese people. We solemnly declare that we will abide by the
                        results of the process we are proposing. The only thing we will not do is to
                        prescribe that outcome in Paris. We will not insist on a particular
                        government; but we will not impose it either.</p>
                    <p>More specifically:</p>
                    <p>— You have asked that we resepct South Vietnamese self-determination and that
                        the political process be free of American interference. We have agreed to
                        this in our readiness to make a series of commitments about the political
                        future of South Vietnam once an agreement is signed.</p>
                    <p>— We have proposed elections to choose a new President. And we have specified
                        that this election be organized and run by an <pb n="26" xml:id="d148-26" facs="d148-26"/>independent electoral commission made up of all
                        political forces and that it be internationally supervised.</p>
                    <p>— You have asked that President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>
                        resign. He has agreed to do so and we have reason to believe that the
                        deadline for his resignation prior to new elections is flexible.</p>
                    <p>— You have asked that democratic liberties be guaranteed. We have agreed to
                        your specific point that democratic liberties, as defined in the 1954 Geneva
                        Accords, be assured in South Vietnam. In addition, we have proposed that all
                        forces be eligible for election or appointment to all branches of government
                        and that they participate in every aspect of the political process freely
                        and securely.</p>
                    <p>— You have asked that a new government of South Vietnam bring about a new
                        constitution. We have agreed that after the new elections the political
                        forces in South Vietnam should meet to revise the Constitution within one
                        year and agree on steps to implement it.</p>
                    <p>— In addition to the merit of these proposals individually, you will no doubt
                        consider the impact of the publication of this agreement and principles on
                        the political process and on the expectations of the people of South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>We have thus addressed every aspect of your political proposals. We have
                        agreed to your basic approach and many of its details. There are some
                        remaining differences to which I will turn in a minute.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the other points in the [PRG] Seven-Point proposal: We have
                        met every one in substance, and in many instances we have incorporated the
                        specific language.</p>
                    <p>— Point Three, the disposition of Vietnamese armed forces, is subsumed under
                        our Point Ten.</p>
                    <p>— Point Four, the reunification of Vietnam and the relations between North
                        and South, is covered by our Point Seven.</p>
                    <p>— Point Five is covered by our Point Eight.</p>
                    <p>— Point Six on reparations we cannot accept, but we maintain our position of
                        last summer regarding our willingness to consider a reconstruction program
                        for all of Indochina.</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="d148-27" facs="d148-27"/>
                    <p>Our other points (nine, ten, and eleven) represent areas of essential
                        agreement last summer when they were based on your nine points.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we have met your concern that the intent of these proposals could be
                        defeated through delaying tactics in the implementing process by placing a
                        three-month time limit on the negotiation to work out the details of the
                        political process. This time limit would enable us to help guarantee that
                        the intent of these proposals is carried out because our withdrawals would
                        not be completed until a month after these negotiations are completed also.
                        At the same time one could not affect the political process with our forces
                        since they would have left at least five months before the elections.</p>
                    <p>Let me explain. We agree on these principles; after these principles, it will
                        take three months to work out the details of the process, it will take four
                        months to withdraw all our forces. Our forces will be withdrawn one month
                        after the details are worked out. The elections will be six months after the
                        details are worked out, or five months after the forces are withdrawn. But
                        the elections can be earlier.</p>
                    <p>Let me point out the new elements in our plan as compared to our January 27th
                        and our May 8th proposals:</p>
                    <p>[Withdrawals] The deadline for total withdrawal of all U.S. and allied forces
                        from South Vietnam is reduced to four months, instead of the six months in
                        our Eight-Point proposal. Assuming the final details of a political
                        settlement are worked out within three months of the general agreement and a
                        new election held six months later, all <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        and allied forces would be out of South Vietnam five months before the
                        elections. This contrasts with our January 25th plan where U.S. withdrawals
                        would be completed by the date of the election.</p>
                    <p>Prisoners. Unlike the President's May 8th proposal, prisoner release would
                        take place after the cessation of acts of force and mining against the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> rather than making these conditional
                        upon completion of prisoner release.</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="d148-28" facs="d148-28"/>
                    <p>Political Issues. Our political proposals offer major new elements expressly
                        designed to meet concerns that you have expressed in your message of May 18
                        and at our last meeting.</p>
                    <p>First, we have reaffirmed that President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and Vice President Huong will resign before the
                        holding of presidential elections. Our new plan deliberately does not
                        specify the time limit. We are prepared to have an understanding with you
                        that we will support an extension of the period beyond the one month
                        provided in our proposal of January 25.</p>
                    <p>Second, the election will take place several months after the last American
                        soldier has left Vietnam, in contrast to our earlier plans.</p>
                    <p>Third, we have specified that in addition to the Presidential election, all
                        political forces would be eligible for appointment or election to positions
                        in all branches of government—executive, legislative and judicial. No
                        political force will be excluded from participation in any part of the
                        political process, at any level.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we have added an explicit statement about guarantees on the rights of
                        all political forces to participate freely and peacefully in the political
                        process. This clause meets your concern that forces aligned with your side,
                        and others, opposed to the present Saigon Administration, might be hindered
                        or prevented from political activities.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, in response to your direct request at our last meeting, we have
                        included a specific reference to Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accord and the
                        guarantee of democratic liberties.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we have added the provision that after a new President has been
                        elected, the political forces in South Vietnam will meet in order to revise
                        the Constitution within one year and agree to implement it. This accepts the
                        outline of this aspect of your side's second point elaboration. Thus, your
                        side will not only have the chance for power in the Presidential election;
                        they will also have the opportunity to negotiate with the new government on
                        revisions of the Constitution. The political process, in other words, is
                        extended beyond one office or one event.</p>
                    <p>These would be formal agreements which we would be prepared to sign. The
                        Special Adviser last time mentioned unsigned agreements as well. I am not
                        sure to what he was referring. But we would be prepared to reach and observe
                        certain private understandings in addition to formal agreements.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="d148-29" facs="d148-29"/>
                    <p>First, we would be prepared to use our influence, all our influence, with the
                        Government of South Vietnam to implement the details of this agreement.</p>
                    <p>Second, as I have indicated, we have reason to believe that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>—as his personal
                        contribution to a guaranteed and lasting peace—might consider the deadline
                        for his resignation negotiable. We envisage, for example, that he might
                        agree to a two-month rather than one-month interval before new elections. In
                        any event, we will support such an understanding with him and Vice President
                        Huong. Let me remind you that last summer you said that President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>'s resignation was the only real
                        requirement for a settlement, after which all other problems could be solved
                        easily. If this was a serious proposal, the opportunity now exists.</p>
                    <p>Third, in conjunction with an overall agreement, we are willing to make
                        certain understandings with regard to the future levels of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military and economic aid to South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, as I have pointed out, we will be prepared to reaffirm privately to
                        your major allies every agreement and understanding we make with you. Thus
                        if we were to violate any agreements, we would be breaking faith not only
                        with you but also with countries whose relations are very important to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, we are prepared to listen seriously to any proposals you may wish to
                        make with regard to future understandings.</p>
                    <p>Our proposals are a deliberate, conscientious attempt to give the people of
                        South Vietnam an opportunity to shape their own future. We have structured
                        them within the framework your side has put forward. But we have refused to
                        impose a particular solution. We cannot so weaken the political forces
                        opposed to the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> that the resulting
                        political process will be a sham. We will cooperate honestly in constructing
                        a truly free political process. We will not participate in a thinly veiled
                        subterfuge for imposing one particular solution.</p>
                    <p>I tell you solemnly that we will carry out these agreements without any
                        afterthought to undo its unfolding. We are prepared to live with its
                        consequences. We have proposed a plan that irrevocably removes the American
                        military presence, stops the conflict and the suffering, and lays out a
                        concrete political process to give the people of South Vietnam <pb n="30" xml:id="d148-30" facs="d148-30"/>a free choice, and a deadline to
                        achieve it. This plan would be guaranteed by our agreement with you; by our
                        commitment to your major allies; by other international forces; and by the
                        geopolitical realities of the 1970s.</p>
                    <p>The need on both sides for a peaceful resolution has never been clearer.
                        Recent events have demonstrated that no one can “win everything” on the
                        other fronts of this conflict either. We have no wish to impose a military
                        solution and no illusion that it could be purchased cheaply. We have no
                        intention of inflicting needless destruction. We do not want to humiliate
                        you. We consider your independence an essential element of long-term
                        Southeast Asian policy. We are ready to take risks to terminate the fighting
                        now, end our involvement, and set the stage for political competition among
                        the Vietnamese alone.</p>
                    <p>We have made our basic decision to settle this conflict if you will meet us
                        part way.</p>
                    <p>You have a similar decision to make. You can join us now in a serious effort
                        to reach a negotiated settlement that takes account of both sides' concerns.
                        This requires concrete proposals and movement from both sides, and a
                        willingness to leave some matters to a political evolution.</p>
                    <p>Your other choice would be to wait upon events, listening to what we have to
                        say without budging from your essential positions. You would thus be hoping
                        for one of two things to happen: Either we accept all of your demands, which
                        will not happen, or a new President is elected in November who will accept
                        all of your demands.</p>
                    <p>The waiting course would be a serious mistake. You should not be misled by
                        temporary Congressional votes—as you know, they do not address political
                        questions at all.</p>
                    <p>As for looking towards our elections, you will make your own judgment about
                        the prospects of the opposition. I will not discuss our domestic politics
                        with you. It is clear, however, that if our election turns into a national
                        referendum on Vietnam, you will be gambling for high stakes. This
                        Administration's position can only be greatly bolstered by such an
                        outcome.</p>
                    <p>Over recent years, you often have decided to wait, and the objective result
                        has been a worsening of your overall position. Even if the opposition <pb n="31" xml:id="d148-31" facs="d148-31"/>were to win, could they really
                        execute what they now promise as candidates, or if they attempt it will it
                        make a decisive difference by January 20, 1973? Over time, the South
                        Vietnamese government and military posture will continue to grow stronger,
                        and our influence on any settlement will decrease.</p>
                    <p>You have often accused us of missing opportunities. But you too have often
                        waited too long. The basic mistake in the summer of 1971 was not this or
                        that agreement, but your basic decision to start the negotiations much too
                        late to influence the election. By July [1971] when we first talked
                        seriously it was much too late. Do not make that same mistake again.</p>
                    <p>I therefore hope you will give serious consideration to what has been
                        presented. It is not presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis; we are
                        prepared to hear counterproposals. We have, however, included just about
                        every element that we think can contribute to a fair and open political
                        process for all forces. The only thing we have not done is to guarantee your
                        side's victory in advance.</p>
                    <p>I welcome your comments. And I look forward to hearing your own concrete
                        proposals. At our last meeting you spoke eloquently about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Vietnamese cooperation at Viet Bac at the end
                        of World War II and about the prospect of a “new page” in our' relations at
                        the end of this war. We share these sentiments. I want to repeat again today
                        that the United States has no greater goal than to end this conflict in a
                        manner that will respect the interests of all parties and will heal the
                        wounds that have been inflicted. Our two countries do not present any long
                        term threat to one another. There is every reason to rekindle the
                        cooperation that existed at the end of a previous war.</p>
                    <p>So let us now end this war. Let us both devote our energies today, and in the
                        coming weeks, to find a just settlement that will allow us to turn a new
                        page in relations between our two countries and our two peoples. That is our
                        attitude.</p>

                    <p>I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the courtesies
                        you extended to Dr. Kissigner on his recent visit to Peking. He reported to
                        me at great length on this talks with you and I was pleased to note that the
                        candor and the constructive attitude which have characterized our discussion
                        in the past are continuing at this time.</p>
                    <p>I trust we can continue to work together toward the goal of normalizing
                        relations between our two countries.</p>

                    <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                    <p>August 31, 1972</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on August 30, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Chinese Mission at 1700 hours, where I was greeted by Mrs. Shih
                        and escorted to a room on the second floor. Mrs. Shih served tea and a
                        twenty-minute disucssion on non-substantial matters followed.</p>
                    <p>After approximately twenty-five minutes, Mrs. Shih mentioned that the
                        Ambassador was unavoidably detained and would not be able to join us. I then
                        presented the note (Tab A) to Mrs. Shih, who read it and said she understood
                        it, had no questions and would pass it to the Ambassador as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih then guided the conversation back to generalities and served a
                        second pot of tea.</p>
                    <p>I departed the Mission at 1755 and telephoned Colonel
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> to advise him that the note had been
                        delivered.</p>

                        August 22, 1972 incident.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side expresses once again its sincere regret for the loss of life
                        resulting from this matter. It will do its utmost to prevent recurrence, but
                        wishes to point out that the activities involved run the risk of inadvertent
                        and regrettable incidents.</p>

                    <p>SUBJECT: <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Protest Over the Sinking of a
                        Small Waterborne Logistic Craft on 22 August 1972</p>
                    <p>1. An investigation has been conducted of a <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> protest over the sinking of an alleged <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> lifeboat in the vicinity of Hon Ngu Island
                        on 22 August 1972. The investigation included personal interview of the
                        pilots by the Commanding Officer, Oriskany, photos of Hung Chi 151 on 25
                        August 1972 and comments from Commanding Officer USS Truxton whose ship was
                        controlling the two A-7 aircraft involved. The principal elements disclosed
                        by this investigation were:</p>
                    <p>a. The movements and nature of the craft attacked coincided with the
                        movements and nature of many other waterborne logistic craft noted in the
                        past. These craft have been attacked and destroyed because they are engaged
                        in transporting supplies from merchant ships at Hon Ngu anchorage into the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>b. The location of the boat at the time of the bombing Was approximately 1500
                        feet from the nearest merchant ship. An A-7 flight, requested permission
                        from the USS Truxton to attack the boat. Truxton authorized expending
                        ordnance against the boat only after the pilots twice checked for presence
                        of flag and reported back there was no flag. Although the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> alleges the boat was a “lifeboat,” the
                        aircrews report several boxes or crates were observed in the boat. Based on
                        this observation, it was concluded that supplies were being carried by the
                        North Vietnamese from the northern merchant ship. The boat was sunk with one
                        500 lb. bomb dropped from an A-7.</p>
                    <p>c. 25 August photography reveals that Hung Chi is missing one of the two
                        small boats normally carried aft. Photography on 19 August had both boats in
                        place. It may be surmised from this information and from the correlation of
                        boat sizes, that the boat which was sunk could have been from the Hung Chi
                        151.</p>
                    <p>d. According to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, the boat was sunk at
                        18°47'56”; 105°45'12”; the A-7 flight reported the position as 18°47'45”,
                        105045'. The two positions differ only 1100' in their north-south
                        orientation. It is noted that this position is approximately one-third of
                        the distance from shore line to Hon Ngu Island—another indication to the
                        aircrew that the boat was carrying supplies.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d150-04" facs="d150-04"/>
                    <p>2. To summarize: The boat appeared to be carrying supplies; it was near shore
                        according to both <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and aircrew reports;
                        it was not flying a flag; two low level identification passes were made to
                        ascertain the boat's mission. The attack was initiated in accordance with
                        the formally proclaimed intention of the United States to prevent the
                        delivery of seaborne supplies to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>

                    <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION</p>
                    <p>DATE, TIME &amp; PLACE: August 14, 1972, 3:30-4:10 p.m., New York</p>
                    <p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> remarked that just as Commander Howe was calling Mrs.
                        Shih for an appointment he was thinking of calling Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for a meeting. Commander Howe
                        stated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> hoped to
                        meet with the Ambassador in the near future and the reason why he could not
                        do it this week would become more obvious when the Ambassador had been made
                        aware of the contents of the U.S. note. The Ambassador probably realized
                        that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was in Paris
                        today. Commander Howe then read the note at Tab A remarking that although he
                        knew it was not necessary he wanted to point out that not only the first
                        item but the second item was also sensitive. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s travel would of course be announced at the
                        appropriate time. When Commander Howe had handed over the note at Tab A, the
                        Ambassador responded the he would convey the information to Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador them remarked that he knew Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had been busy recently and he wished to convey a
                        message to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He
                        indicated that there were three items in the message and then conveyed the
                        following, reading from prepared notes.</p>
                    <p>1. First, in his message of August 4 the Chinese side gave its own analysis
                        of the Soviet proposal that the Soviet Union and the United States sign a
                        treaty on mutual nuclear nonaggression with no intention to ascribe Soviet
                        motivation to the United. States. We furthermore <pb n="2" xml:id="d151-02" facs="d151-02"/>express the hope that the United States will value the
                        principle jointly affirmed by China and the United States (in the Shanghai
                        communique) and reject the Soviet proposal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that you did not accept the proposal. Based
                        on its understanding, the Chinese side cannot agree to the formula the U.S.
                        is considering and doubts whether it can avoid being exploited by the Soviet
                        Union because the Soviet Union can exactly use the pretext of “creating a
                        condition” to dish up all kinds of proposals to serve nuclear monopoly and
                        nuclear superiority.</p>
                    <p>We wish to say frankly that the Chinese side is not so worried about the
                        Soviet attempt to isolate China. On the contrary, there are signs indicating
                        that the Soviet Union is trying to create through its anti-China propaganda
                        a false sense of security in Europe. This is worthy of attention and has
                        probably long been noticed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Gerhard Schroeder</persName> came to China
                        as Chairman of the Foreign Political Committee of the Bundestag. His main
                        interest lay in the discussion of establishing diplomatic relations but he
                        was not commissioned to negotiate. Mr.. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> maintained that a question of establishing
                        diplomatic relations between China and West Germany should be above parties
                        in West Germany and he used the German word “uber parteilich.” The Chinese
                        side expressed appreciation of this.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese and West Germany governments have initially contacted each other.
                        Both sides believe that it would be desirable to establish diplomatic
                        relations as early as possible and that there should be no obstacles. The
                        two sides will soon enter into negotiations. If Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wishes to promote this, he should
                        naturally be welcome.</p>
                    <p>3. Following formation of his Cabinet, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> of Japan expressed the desire to
                        increase efforts to realize the normalization of diplomatic relations
                        between China and Japan. Proceeding from its consistent stand the Chinese
                        side responded positively. The Chinese side has stated that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d151-03" facs="d151-03"/>is welcome to visit China. The
                        Chinese side understands the importance of Japanese/U.S. relations to both
                        Japan and the United States, and it will not embarrass the United States
                        government in the process of negotiating the restoration of diplomatic
                        relations between China and Japan.</p>
                    <p>Without referring to his notes the Ambassador then commented that Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had received the
                        original copy of the letter of thanks sent on June 28 by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. The Prime Minister considers this a
                        friendly gesture and wishes to convey his greetings to the President.</p>
                    <p>Commander Howe indicated that the Prime Minister's greetings would indeed be
                        conveyed to the President who undoubtedly would be most appreciative. The
                        three substantive matters which the Ambassador had conveyed would be brought
                        to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s attention. When
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> returned from his trip
                        we would be in touch to arrange a mutually convenient time to get
                        together.</p>
                    <p>In the closing pleasantries it was noted that Mr. Kuo would be accompanying
                        the Ambassador and Mrs. Shih to all future meetings. Mr. Kuo indicated that
                        he had been present during both the July and October 1971 American visits,
                        but had been at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> since the Chinese
                        delegation first arrived.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d151-04" facs="d151-04"/>
                    <p>1. The U.S. side has considered carefully the Chinese comments, conveyed on
                        August 4, 1972, concerning the Soviet proposal for an agreement on nuclear
                        weapons. Enclosed for the confidential information of the Chinese side is a
                        copy of the text of the recent Soviet proposal. The U.S. side will not
                        accept this proposal. It will fully inform the Chinese side of the U.S.
                        response which will certainly reflect all the considerations raised by the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>2. The U.S. side wishes to inform the Chinese side that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will travel to Saigon following
                        his August 14, 1972 secret meeting with the North Vietnamese in Paris. The
                        purpose of this trip is to review once more the negotiating positions in an
                        effort to make rapid progress toward a just settlement of the Vietnam war.
                        The U.S. side wishes to reaffirm its view that a prolongation of the
                        conflict serves the interest of no country.</p>
                    <p>3. On his return trip from Saigon, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is considering stopping briefly in Japan. His
                        talks in Tokyo would be related solely to the upcoming meeting in Hawaii
                        between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> and the
                        President and would not concern other matters. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wants the Prime Minister to know
                        that the U.S. has no objection to the normalization of relations between
                        Japan and the People's Republic of China and will interpose no obstacles or
                        delays.</p>

                    <p>Guided by the aims of strengthening world peace and international security,
                        Being aware that a nuclear war would have devastating consequences for all

                    <p>MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION</p>
                    <p>DATE AND TIME: Monday, August 28, 1972, 5:00 - 5:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: New York</p>
                    <p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                        noted that he had both a written message and an oral message to convey. He
                        then read the written message at Tab A. He then indicated that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side would be receiving a further report on
                        this incident by August 29, 1972, and would communicate it to the Chinese
                        side. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH2">Hua</persName> asked if all that
                        had been read was contained in the note which Mr.
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> handed to him to which Mr.
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> replied affirmatively. The Ambassador
                        indicated that he would transmit the message to his government. He invited
                        Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName> then to make the oral statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName> then read the oral statement at Tab B. The
                        Ambassador said that he would transmit the oral message to the Prime
                        Minister. He then made the following statement speaking without notes:</p>
                    <p>We transmitted through this channel the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        position on this incident. It is as stated in our message. The lifeboat
                        belonged to the Chinese; it did not carry cargo; and it was flying the flag
                        of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. This position was clearly stated
                        in the message given to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side in the
                        statement of the Foreign Minister and the speech made by the spokesman of
                        the Ministry of Information.</p>
                    <p>We hope that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side will be dealing
                        seriously with this matter and that it will secure against recurrences of
                        similar incidents. The Chinese Government reserves the right to request
                        compensation for losses.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d152-02" facs="d152-02"/>
                    <p>I hope that you will let us know of your final report of the investigations.
                        As was stated in our message the last time, the Chinese side has made
                        repeated representations to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side but
                        still incidents recur. That is why the Chinese side could not but make
                        public the facts of this incident. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        side has made many representations as to guarantees of steps to assure
                        against such incidents but still incidents have recurred. The Chinese
                        Government therefore could not but protest to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side. The statement by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        Command in Saigon was totally in denial of this incident. In short, the
                        message, the statement of the Foreign Minister and the speech of the
                        Government's spokesman have made the Chinese side's position very clear. We
                        will not dwell on it further here. I hope the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side will investigage the incident seriously. I will
                        transmit the messages you have given me to our government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName> assured the Ambassador that as the note
                        indicated, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side takes these matters
                        and representations of the Chinese side concerning them very seriously
                        indeed and investigates them very thoroughly. He stated that the
                        Ambassador's statement would be conveyed to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. The Ambassador expressed appreciation and said
                        that he would await the further report but that meanwhile the written and
                        oral messages which Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName> had given him would be
                        transmitted.</p>
                    <p>Following closing pleasantries, the Ambassador indicated that he would look
                        forward to receiving the further report of the incident and expressed
                        appreciation for Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s bringing the messages to
                        him.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d152-03" facs="d152-03"/>
                    <p>The U.S. side has carefully studied the Chinese message of August 25,
                        1972.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the comments concerning representations by the Chinese side
                        through this channel, the U.S. side would like to point out once again the
                        seriousness with which it has treated every Chinese message. The U.S. side
                        has appreciated the use of the private channel for this type of information.
                        It is, of course, up to the Chinese side to decide when to publicize these
                        matters and to what extent public controversy between the U.S. and the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is desirable.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. has meticulously investigated every incident that has been brought
                        to its attention and reported the results of its investigations to the
                        Chinese side. Despite the fact that these results often have not
                        corresponded to the allegations, the U.S. side has consistently expressed
                        regret for any inadvertent transgression or damage that may have
                        occurred.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d152-04" facs="d152-04"/>
                    <p>In addition, the U.S. side has taken the strictest precaution to insure that
                        border violations do not occur. The Chinese side has been informed of many
                        concrete steps taken by the U.S. side to prevent incidents.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the August 22, 1972 incident, the U.S. side regrets the loss
                        of life. It will continue to do everything possible to prevent the
                        recurrence of such incidents. It must be pointed out once again, however,
                        that events arising out of efforts in waters near North Vietnam to
                        contravene the U.S. measures to prevent the supply of war materials are of a
                        distinctly different nature than alleged violations of the Chinese
                        border.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side's initial investigation of the August 22, 1972 incident has
                        produced the following report:</p>
                    <p>— No flag was observed.</p>
                    <p>— The craft was involved in the movement of cargo.</p>
                    <p>— Only after the above facts were established did the attack take place.</p>
                    <p>In light of the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement of August 27, 1972, the
                        U.S. will make a new and detailed investigation of this matter and report
                        any further information that may become available. The U.S. side wants the
                        Chinese side to know that events such as d escribed in the Chinese
                        statements will not be permitted to occur.</p>
                    <p>The United States has been making maximum efforts to bring the Indochina war
                        to an early conclusion on a basis just to all parties. No nation can have an
                        interest in seeing the conflict prolonged and all can benefit from its rapid
                        conclusion. For its part, the U.S. side will continue to do its utmost to
                        reach a negotiated settlement in Paris in a constructive and generous
                        spirit.</p>

                    <p>ORAL MESSAGE</p>
                    <p>I have been asked to convey to you the following message for the Prime
                        Minister in addition to our written note.</p>
                    <p>“There comes a time in international events when the long view must be taken.
                        The United States side questions whether it is in the Chinese interest to
                        see the Indochina conflict seriously complicate the position of the present
                        United States Administration in light of all that it has done and is
                        prepared to do in a global context. There are more fundamental
                        considerations involved given this Administration's constant awareness of
                        the dangers of modern imperialism.</p>
                    <p>“Accordingly, the United States side hopes that the Prime Minister would
                        carefully consider the problem of Indochina in a broader framework. The
                        United States will continue its earnest search for a rapid conclusion of the
                        war on a just basis for all parties. It is clear at this point that other
                        countries, too, have a responsibility to help speed the end of the conflict

                    <p>WASHINGTON D.C. 20301</p>
                    <p>You requested a report by July 12, 1972, on the alleged violation of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Air Space on July 5, 1972, and the alleged
                        bombing of two <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> fishing boats on June 20,
                        1972.</p>
                    <p>The alleged incidents have been investigated by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and the component commanders. As in previous cases, no
                        evidence has been found so far to support either allegation.</p>
                    <p>I have attached the report of the investigation submitted to me by the Acting
                        Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                    <p>The restrictive measures I have implemented to control air strikes in the
                        vicinity of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Buffer Zone will make it
                        possible to reconstruct each flight operating near the Buffer Zone. In this
                        way I expect to add to the credibility of any future investigations if
                        additional protests are made by the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.
                        But, more importantly, I expect these measures will eliminate future <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> complaints.</p>
                    <p>If additional facts are established regarding these two Incidents, you will
                        be informed immediately.</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff</p>
                    <p>Washington, D.C.</p>
                    <p>12 July 1972</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE</p>
                    <p>SUBJECT: Alleged Border Violations and Bombings</p>
                    <p>1. Reference is made to:</p>
                    <p>a. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> allegations concerning the sinking of
                        two fishing boats on 20 June 1972 and border violations and bombings on 5
                        July 1972.</p>
                    <p>b. Your memorandum, subject: “<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        Allegations,” dated 11 July 1972, which expressed concern over the continued
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> allegations and the need for
                        positive control over all air strikes in the vicinity of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and component commanders have
                        investigated the allegations and have found no evidence to support their
                        validity. However, one aircraft was reported as being near but south of the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border on 5 July 1972. The pilot
                        cleared the area when directed to do so. The details of the incident and
                        results of the examination of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        allegations in order of date are as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. Fishing Boats. Although a final report from COMSEVENTHFLEET has not yet
                        been received, the only known possible involvement in the alleged attack
                        against two fishing boats at 1700H, 20 June 1972, was a strike against two
                        80-foot waterborne logistics craft (WBLCs) in the vicinity of 20° 42' N/107°
                        08' E, at 1630H, 20 June 1972, approximately 39 <gloss target="#t_nm1">NM</gloss> southwest of Cu Xu Island. All evidence confirms that the
                        vessels were in fact WBLCs and not fishing craft. During a surveillance
                        mission, two A-7 aircraft flew north toward Cam Pha remaining west of the
                        larger island along 107° 20' <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> longitude. Two
                        motorized vessels were noted on a westerly heading, each with a good-sized
                        wake. Pilots' first surveillance pass was at 3500-4000 feet above sea level.
                        Several other vessels in the area had fishing <pb n="3" xml:id="d153-03" facs="d153-03"/>nets/associated fishing gear on deck but these specific
                        vessels had clean decks with two stacks of wooden boxed cargo (amidship and
                        forward) and a stack of filled burlap bags on the fantail. Pilots made three
                        more surveillance passes over the vessels at about 1,000 feet above sea
                        level. Pilots then continued on with coastal surveillance mission flying
                        from Cam Pha area south to Vinh area and then returned. Pilots again
                        surveilled vessels at about 1,000 feet above sea level to confirm vessels
                        laden with cargo. Two stacks of supplies previously observed were each
                        estimated approximately five feet high, ten to fifteen feet wide, twenty
                        feet long. On the basis of this evidence, which differentiated these vessels
                        from other craft in area rigged for fishing, the WBLCs were then attacked
                        with bombs. No strafing was conducted. No personnel were seen in the water
                        or aboard the vessels before or after the attack and no strafing was
                        conducted.</p>
                    <p>b. Border Violations. On 5 July 1972, according to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft
                        allegedly intruded in three groups of four aircraft each into Chinese air
                        space. They allegedly dropped one bomb, launched two guided missiles and
                        jettisoned two fuel tanks.</p>
                    <p>(1) The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy ship providing advisory
                        control to approximately twenty-five <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>
                        aircraft, reported the track of one aircraft near but south of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border at 1l35H. The pilot was vectored to
                        180° and away from the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border.</p>
                    <p>c. Bombing/Missile/Reserve Fuel Tanks. There was no evidence of bombings or
                        missiles being launched on 5 July 1972 which would have reached the alleged
                        points of impact in or near the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        border.</p>
                    <p>(1) A search of OPREP BDA revealed only one strike north of 21° N and east of
                        106° 30' E. This strike was a flight of four A-7 and one F-4 aircraft
                        against four large WBLCs at 21° 02' N and 107° 47' <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> in the vicinity of coastal islands. One WBLC was destroyed
                        and one was sunk.</p>
                    <p>(2) One AGM-78 (STANDARD ARM) and six AGM-45 (SHRIKE) missiles were launched
                        according to OPREP messages. An analysis of all known firings found only one
                        possible candidate, an AGM-45 (SHRIKE) launched by an F-lO5 [text not
                        declassified] The estimated flight path, direction of firing toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border and range would have placed
                        the impact point some 11 <gloss target="#t_nm1">NM</gloss> south of the
                        border.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d153-04" facs="d153-04"/>
                    <p>(3) One flight (2 F-4D and 3 F-4E aircraft) observed the launch of three SA-2
                        missiles at 1132H against another flight. Based upon the location of the
                        observing flight, the location of the launch site, the time (1135H) of the
                        one radar track near the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border, and the
                        maximum optimum impact range of 20. 5 <gloss target="#t_nm1">NM</gloss>, the
                        SA-Zs could have struck the alleged missile impact area.</p>
                    <p>(4) On occasion, fuel tanks are jettisoned to engage <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> aircraft or to avoid <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                        firings. However, there is no evidence on the alleged dropping or lobbing of
                        fuel tanks across the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border on 5 July
                        1972.</p>
                    <p>3. As indicated in previous memoranda on this subject, every precaution is
                        being taken to avoid inadvertent intrusion into the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> air space and to guard against delivery of ordnance against
                        unauthorized targets.</p>
                    <p>4. Additional strengthening of control procedures to further reduce the
                        possibility of aircraft inadvertently violating the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border was instituted on 11 July 1972.</p>
                    <p>5. I believe that all commanders in the field recognize the seriousness of
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> allegations and the need to exercise
                        every precaution. I can assure you that if additional strengthening control
                        procedures can be found, they will be instituted without delay.</p>

                        and Bombings by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Aircraft</p>
                    <p>In response to your memorandum of June 30, 1972 concerning <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> allegations of border violations and
                        bombings by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft, I am attaching a

                    <p>This report indicates that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft neither
                        penetrated nor bombed <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> territory.
                        Nevertheless, as reported to you in a separate memorandum today, I have
                        instituted additional restrictive measures for our air strikes near the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Buffer Zone, which will further
                        assure that our aircraft do not violate the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE</p>
                    <p>Subject: <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Allegations of Border Violations
                        arid Bombings by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Aircraft (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>1. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Reference is made to your memorandum
                        of 30 June 1972, subject: “Allegations of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        Aircraft Intrusions into China,” which requested the reopening of the
                        investigation of this incident.</p>
                    <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) In their allegation the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> charge that two <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft intruded into <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        air space at 0056H arid 0058H (local time) on 10 June in the area of Ping
                        Hsiang, Kwang Si Province. They further charge that during the second
                        alleged intrusion, bombs were dropped on <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        structures in the village of Aikou.</p>
                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) A previous investigation of these
                        allegations indicated that we could find no clear proof that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft had in fact violated <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> air space or bombed <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> territory. It was concluded that the possibility of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ordnance being dropped in China was remote
                        arid that all indications were that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        aircraft operating in the area at that time had remained in North Vietnam.
                        However, in response to additional evidence subsequently set forth by the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, a second investigation of the
                        alleged intrusion and bombing has been conducted. There is still no positive
                        proof of the validity of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        charges.</p>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) In reexamining this allegation, an
                        analysis of all available information (including reports of planned strikes,
                        reports of strikes flown, computer printouts of SEAsia air operations, a
                        partial trace of ordnance lot numbers, photo interpretation of post strike
                        photography, and field commanders' assessments) for the period 9-11 June
                        1972 has been conducted. This analysis has established that <pb n="7" xml:id="d153-07" facs="d153-07"/>Seventh Air Force had no aircraft
                        operating above 210 North latitude in North Vietnam within four hours of
                        either side of the time period in question. However, [text not
                        declassified].</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Six A-7 aircraft were launched from
                        the USS KITTY HAWK between 100017H and 100024H with the mission of
                        conducting [text not declassified].</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) All aircraft received a navigational
                        update prior to crossing the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> coast with
                        all systems indicating [text not declassified]. (See Enclosure)</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The first four aircraft arrived in the
                        target area at approximately 0047H, 0052H, 0054H and 0058H respectively.
                        This put them within 15 nautical miles of the alleged violation within
                        minutes of the time the intrusion is said to have occurred. The remaining
                        two aircraft arrived at approximately 0116H and Oll8H, some 18 to 20 minutes
                        after the alleged incident.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The lead aircraft observed many
                        vehicles with their lights on moving on Route 1A. He attacked these vehicles
                        and caused several fires which were seen by all subsequent pilots. The lead
                        aircraft also drew AAA fire, probably from mobile units with the convoy,
                        which was seen by the second and third pilots while the fourth pilot
                        observed AAA fire directed against the number three aircraft. The vehicles
                        on the road continued to flash their lights on periodically and this,
                        coupled with the fires along the road caused by the first strike, made it
                        possible to see the vehicles and follow the line of the highway out of the
                        target area.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d153-08" facs="d153-08"/>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The number four pilot reported that he
                        attacked the northernmost target struck. The point at which he reports
                        having dropped his ordnance is approximately 13 nautical miles from the area
                        of the alleged incident. Considering the accuracy of the navigational
                        systems, the good visibility and the well-distinguished checkpoints, an
                        error of this magnitude appears unlikely.</p>
                    <p>10. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) One <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> was reported in the area for about 10 minutes. Its lights
                        were seen by two <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> pilots at approximately
                        0100H. One <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> took off from Phuoc Yen at
                        0100H headed north and returned prior to 0120H when a second <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> took off to the north. There is no evidence
                        of more than one <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> airborne at any one
                        time in the area of interest.</p>
                    <p>11. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The ingress and egress of all
                        aircraft was monitored by an E-2 Airborne Early Warning aircraft which also
                        confirmed their position prior to crossing the coast on their ingress route.
                        While not holding all aircraft continuously, the E-2 did not observe any
                        border violations and, upon request from the Tactical Air Control Center
                        aboard the USS LONG BEACH, recalled all aircraft from the target area. The
                        last two aircraft completed their strikes at OllOH before heading home.</p>
                    <p>12. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) There is a marked geographic
                        similarity between the Lang Son and Ping Hsiang areas and, though the two
                        cities are some 15 nautical miles apart, it is conceivable that a
                        navigational error and resultant misidentification could have occurred.
                        Further, there could have been an inadvertent ordnance release. However,
                        such a unique set of circumstances seems most unlikely. Further, a review of
                        all naval tactical data system tapes does not reflect any tracks crossing
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border.</p>
                    <p>13. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The 1t numbers of the two MK-20 bombs
                        identified by the Chinese as having been dropped in the vicinity of the
                        village of Aikou have been traced as far as possible. These lots, 34C-71 and
                        48-C-71, were handled by NAV <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> SUBIC
                        during 1971 and 1972. However, it could not be determined that bombs from
                        these lots were or were not in fact delivered to the USS KITTY HAWK.</p>
                    <p>14. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) In addition to the foregoing, the
                        following apparent discrepancies merit consideration.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d153-09" facs="d153-09"/>
                    <p>a. The MK-20 (ROCKEYE II) dispenser (cluster) bomb contains 247 MK-118 <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> O antitank/anti-personnel bombs in a
                        bomb-shaped canister. Thus, if two MK-20s were inadvertently released near
                        Aikou, 494 MK-118 bombs should have fallen in the area. When a 20 is
                        released from 5,500 feet or less, which is the usual dive bombing release
                        altitude, the normal dispersal pattern covers an area of 1,000 feet or less
                        in diameter. However, this coverage pattern would increase to approximately
                        2,500 feet in diameter when the weapon is released from 8,000 feet in level
                        flight. The MK-118 bombs would be scattered over an extremely large
                        unpredictable area if released over 10,000 feet. Further, depending on
                        several aircraft flight variables, such as climbing, banking, speed, etc.,
                        the MK-118s could travel more than three nautical miles in an inadvertent
                        release situation. Thus, it seems more likely that the few MK-118s which
                        were reported to have fallen on the village of Aikou were as a result of an
                        inadvertent high-altitude MK-20 release over North Vietnam rather than as a
                        result of a release during a direct fly-over of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> village as alleged.</p>
                    <p>b. Improbability of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> pilots flying on a
                        northerly heading knowing their close proximity to the CHICOM border.</p>
                    <p>15. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) In summary, there were six <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy aircraft within 15 nautical miles of the
                        area of the alleged violation within minutes of the time in question.
                        However, all were flown by experienced pilots, carefully selected for this
                        mission, flying fully-systems-capable aircraft under good weather
                        conditions. The only plausible explanation for the few MK-118 bombs to have
                        been dropped in the vicinity of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        village of Aikou, if in fact the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> facts
                        are accurate, is that one of the aircraft had a high altitude inadvertent
                        release. This could have resulted in two MK-20 cluster bombs being dropped
                        in the vicinity of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> border scattering
                        the MK-118 bombs over a wide area, a few of which were found in Aikou. Since
                        the MK-118 bomblets in possession of the Chinese were “duds” and did not
                        explode it is obvious that they were not released with the intent to strike
                        a target.</p>

                        Incidents</p>
                    <p>In response to your request for information relating to subject incidents,
                        the following is provided:</p>
                    <p>1. 090800Z June 1972. Two A-7 aircraft from CORAL <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> conducting lighter interdiction/airborne recce in vicinity
                        Hon Nieu anchorage made two passes parallel to centerline of an anchored
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> mership. First low pass was at O7l5Z
                        with one aircraft on each side of ship at 1500 yards range. The second
                        similar type low pass at 0800Z was at range 300 yards and the aircraft
                        passing between the ship and Hon Nieu Island observed muzzle flashes from
                        the forward gun mount on the ship. No damage to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft.</p>
                    <p>2. 261208Z June 1972. One of two CORAL SEA aircraft assigned to Hon Nieu
                        anchorage surveillance made a wings level pass at 2000 feet altitude
                        crossing the western end of Hon Nieu Island to observe the three merchant
                        ships at anchor. The westernmost <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ship
                        opened fire and muzzle flashes, tracers and bursts were observed. On the
                        second pass the two aircraft, in trail, again passed over the western tip of
                        Hon Nieu at least 1/2 mile from the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        merships and again tracking fire and bursts above the lead aircraft were
                        noted by both pilots. No damage to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        aircraft.</p>
                    <p>3. 010600Z July 1972. Section of 2 A-7 aircraft from SARATOGA had located two
                        waterborne logistic craft (WBLC) about three-quarters of a mile from nearest
                        of three <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> merships anchored at Hon Nieu
                        and commenced strafing attacks. On third strafing run, aircraft passing
                        astern of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> mership at 2000 foot altitude
                        with a closest point of approach 3/4 mile, observed numerous tracers coming
                        from the stern of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ship. No damage to
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft.</p>

                    <p>4. 102005Z July 1972. A pilot from the HANCOCK [text not declassified] flying
                        a visual search pass at 3000 feet altitude, 3000 feet from the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> mershlp observed small arms firing at his
                        aircraft. No damage to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircrft, and the
                        pilot reported the firing originated from the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> membership.</p>

                    <p>September 6, 1972</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION</p>
                    <p>DATE AND TIME: Wednesday, September 6, 1972, 7:20-7:45 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Mission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, New York City</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he had two messages for me. I started to take out a note
                        pad, but he said there was no need. He handed me the two messages [a long
                        reply to our communications of August 28 and 30, at Tab A, and a short
                        inquiry about Senator Mansfield's proposed visit, Tab B] and asked me to
                        read them through. I did so, and said I would see that these were reported
                        to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> immediately. The
                        Ambassador said he had nothing additional to convey.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was as cordial as ever. He asked about Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s travel plans, and I mentioned
                        that he would be leaving Saturday morning for Munich instead of Friday
                        morning as originally planned and would be seeing German leaders but not
                        attending the Olympics. I said I understood an appointment had been set up
                        for Friday between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        the Ambassador. I commented that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> very much wanted to see the Ambassador before he
                        left on his trip. The Ambassador understood it would be at the former
                        location, and I said yes, that was my understanding. The Ambassador said,
                        “Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is delaying his
                        departure in order to come here?” I simply repeated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> very much wanted to see the
                        Ambassador before he left.</p>
                    <p>We had one cup of tea, and I thanked the Ambassador for his hospitality but
                        said I didn't want to keep him any longer.</p>
                    <p>Attachments</p>
                    <p>Handed to <persName corresp="#p_RPW1">Rodman</persName> by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>, 9/6/72</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d154-02" facs="d154-02"/>
                    <p>The Chinese side has the following comments with regard to the three U.S.
                        messages of August 28 and 30, 1972:</p>
                    <p>1. From the U.S. messages it seems that the U.S. side thinks it has the right
                        to blockade and bomb the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and attack vessels
                        or vehicles of all kinds transporting supplies to Viet Nam. This stand
                        cannot possibly be accepted by China. Such actions of the U.S. side are an
                        encroachment upon the sovereignty of other countries and a violation of the
                        freedom of international trade and navigation, and run counter to the
                        principles jointly affirmed by both sides in the Sino-U.S. Joint Communique.
                        It must be pointed out that, like violations of the Chinese border, attacks
                        on Chinese ships cannot be tolerated. Chinese ships are transporting
                        supplies to the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam; this is China's sovereign
                        right and no other country has the right to intervene.</p>
                    <p>2. None of the elements that were described as leading to the August 22
                        incident in two of the U.S. messages conform to the actual facts. We
                        recognize that the U.S. Government has made investigations on all the
                        incidents raised in the charges and protests lodged by us. But the answers
                        have generally been words of regret from above but allegations from below
                        that there was cause for raising the matters but no conclusive evidence
                        after investigations. Anyway, as the U.S. side on many occasions stated that
                        incidents such as those <pb n="3" xml:id="d154-03" facs="d154-03"/>raised by
                        China would not be permitted to reoccur, in every case involving
                        infringement of China's sovereignty and harm or loss of Chinese lives, it
                        was not until the evidence was found to be truly reliable through repeated
                        verifications that we advanced charges against the U.S. side. For instance,
                        from 0804 hours, July 15, 1972 (local time), one U.S. aircraft intruded for
                        three minutes into the Changcheng area, Hainan Island, China. Having
                        ascertained that it was really a tanker aircraft and that the weather was
                        bad, we lodged no protest with the U.S. side. During his meeting with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> on July 26, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also attested the fact
                        that this incident indeed occurred. And at the same meeting, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned incidents of Chinese
                        ships firing at U.S. aircraft. We had given strict orders that no firing was
                        permissible unless attacked or bombed. Precisely because of this, and
                        because the August 22 case had been found so serious through verification,
                        we could not but have recourse to an open protest. It is regrettable that in
                        the investigation report delivered on August 30, the U.S. side continues to
                        allege that the boat was a logistic craft rather than a lifeboat. We hereby
                        point out:</p>
                    <p>a. That the lifeboat was flying the national flag of the People's Republic of
                        China was a fact. The flag should logically have been identified since the
                        U.S. side admitted <pb n="4" xml:id="d154-04" facs="d154-04"/>in its message
                        that the U.S. aircraft made two low level identification passes before the
                        bombing. The said flag (66cm x 44cm) as well as parts of the bombed boat
                        have now been recovered from the water. Such factual evidence cannot be
                        denied.</p>
                    <p>b. The lifeboat was not carrying any cargo, it only had one box (34cm x 33cm
                        x 12.5cm) of film reels which were to be shown to the seamen. Obviously,
                        this can hardly be taken as proof that the boat was a “logistic craft”.</p>
                    <p>c. When the boat was bombed, it was moving between the two Chinese merchant
                        ships (Hongqi Nos. 160 and 151), at a distance of 1,970 meters from the
                        shore. The location alleged by the U.S. side was inaccurate. For the U.S.
                        side to surmise that the boat was a “logistic craft” on the basis of the
                        alleged location of the boat between the shore line and Hon Ngu Island, the
                        inshore area being mined, is indeed far-fetched.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side has now admitted that photography on August 19 and 25 prove
                        that the Chinese merchant ship “Hongqi 151” originally carried two
                        lifeboats, of which one has been missing since the bombing. Yet, the U.S.
                        side has tried to create an excuse by asserting that there was no flag so as
                        to shirk responsibility. The Chinese side cannot but express deep regret at
                        this.</p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. side is clear about the Chinese Government's stand on the
                        Indochina question. The Chinese side has on more <pb n="5" xml:id="d154-05" facs="d154-05"/>than one occasion stated that so long as the war
                        continues, no matter in what form, China will firmly support and assist the
                        Indochinese people in their war of resistance to the end. The Chinese side
                        has said frankly many times that the U.S. persistence in its bombing and
                        mining of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and in the “Vietnamization” of
                        the war would definitely be of no help to an early ending of the conflict.
                        On the contrary, it will only drag on the conflict and tie the U.S.
                        Government itself down in an unfavourable position. The Chinese side hopes
                        that on the question of Indochina, the U.S. Government would consider the
                        problem in a broader framework and take the long view, give vigilant
                        consideration to the existence of the other outside force, and withdraw at
                        an early date all armed forces of the United States and its followers from
                        Indochina and first of all from Viet Nam, and let the three Indochinese
                        peoples solve their own problems by themselves. The Chinese side has on many
                        questions made allowance for the circumstances the U.S. Government is in
                        now. However, the responsibility for the expansion of the conlict in
                        Indochina does not lie with our side. We have no alternative but to adhere
                        to principles.</p>

                    <p>On another subject, will it not affect your bi-partisan relationship if
                        Mansfield comes alone for a visit? Samdech Sihanouk has expressed that
                        Mansfield's speech in the Senate is not acceptable. Please tell us

                    <p>SOVIET NOTE</p>
                    <p>We would like to inform you confidentially about tho subject we will be
                        introducing as our main political subject at the forthcoming 27th session of
                        the UN General Assembly. We are doing this for the first time—and this in
                        itself is indicative of the advance made in relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> since last May's meeting in Moscow. We are naming this item
                        “On the non-use of force in international relations and on the prohibition
                        for all time of the use of nuclear weapons”.</p>
                    <p>In our view, the discussion of this item at the Assembly session will be
                        useful both for the broad interests of peace and in terms of Soviet-American
                        relations per se. Our proposal envisages that the affirmation of the
                        principle of the non-use of force in international relations must
                        inseparably include also the prohibition for all time of the use of nuclear
                        weapons. The fusing of those two elements constitutes the very core and the
                        principal idea of our proposal.</p>
                    <p>The idea of the non-use of force, of reducing the risk of nuclear war is
                        contained in joint Soviet-American documents, particularly in the “Basic
                        Principle's of Mutual Relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>”. We believe
                        it would now be useful to bring that idea into the sphere of the United
                        Nations. In the past the General Assembly has repeatedly <pb n="2" xml:id="d155-02" facs="d155-02"/>addressed itself to the question of the
                        non-use of force in international relations. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> also dealt separately with the subject of prohibiting the
                        use of nuclear weapons. But it is quite evident that renunciation of the use
                        of force must cover the prohibition of all types of weapons, both
                        conventional and nuclear. Such an approach is prompted by the entire course
                        of development of post-war international relations. Our proposal to merge
                        the prohibition of the use of nuclear and of conventional weapons into a
                        single whole corresponds to the principle of the equal security of states
                        and the inadmissibility of military advantages. This approach, we believe,
                        is in line with the interests of all peoples, including the Soviet and
                        American peoples.</p>
                    <p>In advancing our proposal, we are taking into account, among other things,
                        the following aspect which is very important for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. We are completing our discussion of the delicate issue of
                        the non-use of nuclear weapons between our countries. If the forthcoming
                        General Assembly adopts a resolution along the lines we intend to propose,
                        that will create a good political background for our joint action. In other
                        words, it will correspond to the task of preparing public opinion for this
                        action, to which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        attaches significance.</p>
                    <p>As for the resolution itself, we see it as short but substantial and
                        definite. Its substance would be that the General Assembly would solemnly
                        declare on behalf of the member states of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, in conformity with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Charter, <pb n="3" xml:id="d155-03" facs="d155-03"/>their renunciation of
                        the use or threat of force in internationz relations and the prohibition for
                        all time of the use of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the resolution should
                        include a recommendation to the Security Council to take a decision, as soon
                        as possible, which would make the aforesaid statement by the General
                        Assembly binding in accordance with Article 25 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Let me recall that under Article 25 members of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agree to accept and carry out the
                        decisions of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that the adoption of such a decision by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will in no way imply the renunciation of the

                    <p>Prevention of Nuclear War</p>
                    <p>1. The President has considered our discussions on this subject.</p>
                    <p>2. We believe that any discussion of this subject must take the following
                        points into account:</p>
                    <p>— We believe it important to avoid any formulation that carried an
                        implication of a condominium by our two countries;</p>
                    <p>— We believe it important that an agreement between our two countries should
                        not carry any implication that we were ruling out only nuclear war between
                        ourselves but were leaving open the option of nuclear war against third
                        countries;</p>
                    <p>— We think it important that in concentrating on the prevention of nuclear
                        war we should not at the same time appear to be legitimizing the initiation
                        of war by conventional means;</p>
                    <p>— We think it important that past agreements, whether alliances or other
                        types of obligations, designed to safeguard peace and security should not be
                        put into question.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to tell the Special Adviser and the Minister that at the end of our
                        previous meeting, he said that we are now entering serious negotiations. I
                        want him to know that this is our view as well.</p>
                    <p>The Special Adviser also said that the two sides must find a middle ground
                        between our positions in order to reach a settlement. That, too, is our
                        view.</p>
                    <p>This is why for the last month we have reviewed each other's proposals and
                        our own positions with great seriousness and purposefulness and why I went
                        to South Vietnam officially to discuss the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>In your propaganda you have pictured all this activity as a meaningless
                        charade. But you should know, that these actions represent a major effort by
                        the United States to move toward an early settlement of the war. And I hope
                        you have enough sources in Saigon to confirm that fact. Since you must know
                        the real situation, we find it inconsistent with your protestations of good
                        will that your spokesmen continue to distort our efforts and attack our
                        negotiators.</p>
                    <p>So the first step that must be taken 'here is that each of us show a serious
                        awareness of the other's real problems and that there is a mutual search for
                        the “middle ground” between our two positions. The time is ripe for an
                        overall solution. But I must also tell you that the time is short.</p>
                    <p>We have a new proposal today and I would like to give you its background.</p>
                    <p>I presented your plan of August 1st in Saigon. You will not be astonished to
                        hear that these plans were not greeted with complete enthusiasm and that we
                        were criticized even for presenting them. We had some extremely difficult
                        exchanges.</p>
                    <p>Clearly the political issue is the basic problem we face in these
                        negotiations. Saigon sees in your plans a device for installing a Communist
                        government. Even if we do not agree with every point of Saigon's criticism,
                        we do believe that its objective consequence would be to guarantee the
                        predominance of your supporters.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d157-02" facs="d157-02"/>
                    <p>Your side, on the other hand, rejects an automatic reconfirmation of the
                        present government in Saigon.</p>
                    <p>Faced with this problem, we have sought to find a middle ground, to shape a
                        solution that is just to both sides. Our new plan seeks to remove any unfair
                        advantage for the incumbents without at the same time guaranteeing a Victory
                        for any other force.</p>
                    <p>In order to speed agreed positions with Saigon we have in certain instances
                        used neutral formulations. We want you to know that we will interpret them
                        in the sense of our discussions here and use all our influence in other
                        forums which may open after we agree in principle. I will indicate these
                        interpretations to you after I have presented the plan. We will stand by all
                        that we have told you previously as well as the new elements we now
                        introduce formally and those we give you as informal interpretations. But I
                        must repeat—no progress is possible unless we grant each other's good faith
                        and recognize that this is an objectively difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>Here then is our new proposal. It presents great difficulties for our
                        friends—but we are confident that if you and we agree, it can be
                        implemented.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then read the attached
                        proposal.)</p>
                    <p>Let me comment on this plan in relation to our August 14 proposals. Let me
                        review points and give you additional comments and interpretations.</p>
                    <p>In point 2 you will notice we have reduced the time for our withdrawal from
                        four months to three months.</p>
                    <p>In point 5 we have substituted the word “fairness” for “equality” for the
                        sake of agreement of our associates. However, if in order to obtain
                        agreement the word “equality” should be a decisive one, I will tell you now
                        we are prepared to return to it. If we can settle everything else, I think
                        we can settle that point.</p>
                    <p>Now let me come to two important sets of interpretation. One concerns point
                        9, ceasefire. The other concerns point 4, the political plan. First, with
                        respect to point 9, ceasefire. <pb n="3" xml:id="d157-03" facs="d157-03"/>At
                        our last session the Special Adviser said that the relation of a ceasefire
                        to a political settlement is one of the two major remaining differences. You
                        asserted that a ceasefire before' resolution of the political questions
                        effectively separates political from military issues. Thus, your position
                        has been that a ceasefire should come only after all problems have been
                        settled and after an overall agreement is signed.</p>
                    <p>Your approach to this issue is a good example of your constant attempt to
                        have the best of both worlds. You want to keep on fighting and extend your
                        military influence. On the other hand, you claim in advance that a
                        settlement should yield you political dominance of areas where your forces
                        have not extended their control.</p>
                    <p>You demand our total withdrawal from Vietnam. However, when we offer to do
                        it, you insist that our forces stay on until we have first helped to bring
                        about your preferred political structure.</p>
                    <p>You complained for example in the August 31 article of the Nhan Dan
                        Commentator about the failure to recognize the PRG. But you reject a
                        ceasefire which would lead to a de facto recognition of the PRG. The article
                        claimed that a ceasefire now would leave the large South Vietnamese army in
                        the field to control elections. But there was no mention of the large North
                        Vietnamese army that would also be in the field and - according to you at
                        our last meeting - under PRG command. In a ceasefire-in-place the two
                        standing forces would balance out and would help ensure an equitable
                        political process.</p>
                    <p>In May, July, and August of this year we have made a range of proposals on
                        ceasefire. We offered an immediate ceasefire. We offered a temporary
                        ceasefire. Failing that, we offered a mutual reduction of hostilities. You
                        have rejected all these initiatives.</p>
                    <p>We have also proposed that a ceasefire could take place after agreement in
                        principle and while the details were being worked out. This, too, you have
                        rejected.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d157-04" facs="d157-04"/>
                    <p>We still believe that our approach is practical and just. An early ceasefire
                        would do the following:</p>
                    <p>— Create a political reality and thus is the best means of linking political
                        and military issues - just the opposite of what you maintain.</p>
                    <p>— Produce a de facto control situation in the country, reflecting the real
                        balance of forces.</p>
                    <p>— Serve humanitarian ends.</p>
                    <p>However, in order to speed a comprehensive agreement the President has
                        decided to accept your position on this issue. I am authorized to tell you
                        that we are now prepared to agree—if a settlement depends on it—that a
                        ceasefire should take place after an overall agreement is signed. We shall
                        interpret point 9 to mean that a ceasefire shall occur only at the end of
                        the negotiating process. We have thus fully met your point that a
                        comprehensive solution should precede cessation of hostilities.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d157-05" facs="d157-05"/>
                    <p>Now let me turn to Point 4, the political issue. We agree that this has
                        emerged as the key element.</p>
                    <p>We can agree to a solution that leaves the political evolution of South
                        Vietnam to the free decision of its people. We specifically address your
                        assertion that any political process within the present framework is bound
                        to be controlled by the incumbents and will reconfirm the present power
                        structure. Thus we have proposed a solution that removes any inequitable
                        advantages for the current government, excludes no political force, and
                        assures an equal chance for all forces.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, the test of popular opinion will be run by a committee composed
                        of the elements you proposed. We have thus accepted your tripartite
                        principle even though there is no popular mandate for such representation.
                        And we will apply it as well to the body that will review the Constitution.
                        In the government formed after the election we envisage a tripartite
                        representation as well - but in proportion to the votes achieved rather than
                        arbitrarily fixing equal shares in advance of such a vote. The distinction
                        we make is that we are prepared to give you a veto over the control
                        arrangements on which the fairness of the electoral outcome depends, but we
                        will not in advance determine the outcome of the popular will.</p>
                    <p>To make this approach more concrete we are willing to give you our
                        interpretation of some of the provisions of our proposal.</p>
                    <p>We will interpret the composition of the Committee of National Reconciliation
                        in the tripartite sense of equal proportions that you have advanced. In
                        other words our formulation is composed of the formula you gave us.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Constitution these are unilateral interpretations.</p>
                    <p>Two, with respect to the Constitution, we believe, that revisions will be
                        needed after peace is made. We believe that the Committee of National
                        Reconciliation should play a major role in the revision, and we are prepared
                        to interpret paragraph 4 in that sense and to use our influence in that
                        direction. So the Committee will not end its work with the election.</p>
                    <p>It is as you described it, and it will continue after the election to work on
                        the revisions of the Constitution. But this last point is our interpretation
                        and will have to be an understanding between you and us. <pb n="6" xml:id="d157-06" facs="d157-06"/>The various branches of government

                        branches, all three.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the date for the resignation of the incumbents - specified as
                        one month before the election in our January plan - is negotiable. If this
                        question proves important for overall agreement, we will use our influence
                        in this direction.</p>
                    <p>We believe that these plans and these interpretations would shape a political
                        process that is fair to all parties.</p>
                    <p>We have sought the middle ground with a concrete and reasonable proposal:</p>
                    <p>Let me summarize.</p>
                    <p>We have provided that the political structure in South Vietnam be tested by
                        the popular will. The incumbent President would resign. There would be new
                        popular elections. The Constitution would be subject to revision. And the
                        South Vietnamese would also be free to decide on any other political process
                        to form a new government.</p>
                    <p>We have accepted the principle of three main political forces and tripartite
                        organizations for all control bodies. Thus the Committee of National
                        Reconciliation, which would have the two crucial functions of running the
                        elections and helping in the review of the Constitution, would be composed
                        of representatives of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and other independent political tendencies.
                        This prevents the government from dominating the political process and
                        guarantees all forces equality in the control and supervisory forums.</p>
                    <p>We have assured representation for your side and other forces in the future
                        government. The various forces would gain seats in proportion to the number
                        of votes they received in the Presidential election. Thus this government,
                        too, would have representatives of the three forces you specify. The only
                        thing we have not done is to guarantee the number of seats for any of the
                        forces. That we leave to the people of South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>We have provided for a process of several stages. Rather than freezing the
                        political structure after one event, there would be a continuing evolution
                        with all forces having an effective voice.</p>
                    <p>We agree that the details of this political settlement be resolved before
                        there is a ceasefire.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d157-07" facs="d157-07"/>
                    <p>We accept your position on the implementation of various aspects of an
                        agreement. As you know, our view has been that certain aspects of a
                        settlement, such as withdrawals and the release of prisoners, could be
                        carried out while other details were still being worked on. While we
                        continue to object strongly to your holding our prisoners as hostage, we are
                        prepared to change our position on the sequence issue as well. To show our
                        good will and to remove your fear that we might renege on an agreement in
                        principle, we now agree that implementation of the withdrawal and prisoner
                        provisions would not begin until all negotiations are completed and overall
                        agreement is reached.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these new elements, we have retained our previous offers, such
                        as U.S. neutrality toward the political process; eligibility for all
                        political forces in all branches of government; and guarantees under Article
                        14 (c) of the 1954 Geneva Agreements on which you have specifically
                        insisted.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we have moved up the Presidential election to five, rather than
                        six, months after the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Minister and Mr. Special Adviser, I mentioned earlier the recent
                        editorial in your press and also the speech by your Prime Minister. I have
                        read both with the greatest care.</p>
                    <p>The article asks rhetorically whether the incumbent's resignation and an
                        election would ever take place. You have our ironclad assurances on this
                        point which we are willing to reaffirm to whatever countries you wish.</p>
                    <p>It asks whether elections could possibly be fair. We have specified that they
                        will be controlled by a tripartite body.</p>
                    <p>It challenges the present constitution. We have provided for its review and
                        revision to bring it into harmony with the conditions of peace.</p>
                    <p>It points out the presence of the South Vietnamese army. But your own forces
                        would exert their influence as well, and a ceasefire would bring about a de
                        facto division of jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p>It argues for recognition of the PRG. This is assured de facto in a ceasefire
                        and de jure in the key organizations and the future government.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d157-08" facs="d157-08"/>
                    <p>It complains about our using the designation “<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>” instead of “PRG.” This is not a real issue. A standstill
                        ceasefire would gain more acceptance for the “PRG” than any words we employ
                        here. If we are serious, we should not waste our time on legal quibbles. The
                        solution is that our side use the terminology we prefer, that your side use
                        the terminology you prefer, and that both sides sign both documents.</p>
                    <p>We have made a genuine and maximum effort to take account of your
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that we are making our proposals as a takeit-or-leave-it
                        ultimatum. If you are prepared to consider our plan, we are ready to explore
                        modifications within its framework. But for you to wait for new major
                        concessions will cause you once again to miss the opportune time for a
                        settlement. And for us to suggest that such major concessions were possible
                        would be to mislead you both on what we are willing to do and even more on
                        what we are able to deliver.</p>
                    <p>We are vividly aware of the difficulties we have gone through in order to
                        table this proposal today. We are also conscious of what is required of us
                        to give you these additional interpretations. Against this background, it
                        would be extremely unfortunate if you subjected us once again to your
                        standard charge that we have offered nothing new. You must choose between
                        making debating points and making real progress. You must decide whether to
                        waste the next two months haggling over legal fine print or to use this
                        period to agree on.a course and to implement it energetically in the other
                        forums. And time is getting short.</p>
                    <p>We want to end this war rapidly. Not only to stop the suffering, but to
                        provide justice for both sides. Not only to cease hostilities, but to turn
                        energies to the tasks of peace and reconciliation. Clearly our two countries
                        and our two peoples share an overriding interest in a peace that comes soon
                        and a peace that will last.</p>
                    <p>If you see things the same way, you will find us dedicated partners in the
                        quest for peace.</p>

                    <p>1. The United States respects the independence, sovereignty and territorial
                        integrity of Vietnam, as recognized by the 1954 Geneva Agreements on
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>2. The total withdrawal from South Vietnam of all troops, military advisers,
                        and military personnel, armaments and war material belonging to the United
                        States, and those of other foreign countries allied with the Government of
                        the Republic of Vietnam, and the dismantlement of all U.S. military bases in
                        South Vietnam will be completed within three months after the signing of the
                        overall agreement.</p>
                    <p>After overall agreement is reached, the U.S. is prepared to define its level
                        of military aid with any government that exists in South Vietnam in direct
                        relation to other external military aid introduced into Indochina.</p>
                    <p>3. The release of all military men and innocent civilians captured throughout
                        Indochina will be carried out simultaneously with and completed on the same
                        day as the aforesaid troop withdrawal. The parties will exchange complete
                        lists of the military men and innocent civilians captured throughout
                        Indochina on the day of the signing of the overall agreement.</p>

                    <p>a) The South Vietnamese people will decide the political future of South
                        Vietnam through genuinely free and democratic Presidential elections, review
                        of the Constitution, and any other political processes they agree upon which

                    <p>Electoral procedures will guarantee freedom and equality during the campaign

                    <p>A Presidential election will be held within five months of an overall
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Presidential election will be organized and supervised by a Committee of
                        National Reconciliation which will assume its responsibilities on the date
                        of overall agreement. This body will decide electoral procedures, determine
                        the qualification of candidates, ensure the fairness of voting and verify
                        the election results.</p>

                    <p>There will be international supervision of this election.</p>
                    <p>b) Before the Presidential election, the incumbent President and Vice
                        President a South Vietnam will resign. The Chairman of the Senate will
                        assume the responsibilities of a caretaker head of government except for

                        remain with the Committee of National Reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>c) When he assumes office, the new President will form a new government in

                        of popular votes they received in the Presidential election.</p>

                        or discrimination against persons or organizations on account of their
                        activities during the hostilities and to guarantee democratic liberties.</p>
                    <p>g) For its part, the United States declares that it respects the South
                        Vietnamese right to self-determination; it will remain completely neutral
                        with respect to the political process in South Vietnam; and it will abide by

                    <p>5. The question of Vietnamese armed forces in South Vietnam will be settled
                        by the Vietnamese parties themselves in a spirit of national reconciliation.
                        fairness. and mutual respect, without foreign interference and with a view
                        to lessening the burdens of the people.</p>
                    <p>6. The re-unification of Vietnam will be achieved step by step, through
                        peaceful means on the basis of discussions and agreements between North and
                        South Vietnam, without coercion or annexation from either side and without
                        foreign interference. The time for re-unification will be agreed upon after
                        a suitable interval following the signing of an overall agreement.</p>
                    <p>Pending re-unification, North and South Vietnam will promptly start
                        negotiations toward the reestablishment of normal relations in various
                        fields on the basis of mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam.
                        while Vietnam is still temporarily divided, North and South Vietnam will
                        refrain from joining any military alliance with foreign countries, and from
                        allowing foreign countries to maintain military bases, troops and military
                        personnel on their respective territories.</p>
                    <p>7. The Geneva Agreements of 1954 on Indochina and those of 1962 on Laos will
                        be respected by all parties. The people of each <pb n="14" xml:id="d157-14" facs="d157-14"/>Indochinese country will settle their own internal
                        affairs without foreign interference.</p>
                    <p>The problems existing between the Indochinese countries will be settled by
                        the Indochinese parties on the basis of respect for each other's
                        independence, sovereignty territorial integrity and noninterference in each
                        other's internal affairs. Among the problems that will be settled is the
                        implementation of the principle that all armed forces of the countries of
                        Indochina must remain within their national frontiers.</p>
                    <p>8. The countries of Indochina shall pursue a foreign policy of peace and
                        independence. They will observe the military provisions of the Geneva.
                        Agreements of 1954 and 1962, establish relations with all countries
                        regardless of their political and social regimes. maintain economic and
                        cultural relations with all countries, and participate in programs of
                        regional economic cooperation.</p>
                    <p>9. At a time mutually agreed upon a general ceasefire will be observed
                        throughout Indochina under international control and supervision.</p>
                    <p>As part of the ceasefire the U.S. will stop all its acts of force throughout
                        Indochina by ground air, and naval forces. wherever they may be based and
                        end the ruining of North Vietnamese ports and harbors.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="d157-15" facs="d157-15"/>
                    <p>As part of the ceasefire, there will be no further infiltration of outside
                        forces into any of the countries of Indochina, and the introduction into

                    <p>Creation of favourable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful
                        reunification of Korea</p>
                    <p>The General Assembly,</p>
                    <p>Noting that the peaceful reunification of Korea has still not been achieved,
                        although 27 years have already elapsed since the division of Korea and 19
                        years since the establishment of the armistice in Korea,</p>
                    <p>Warmly welcoming the recent joint statement in which North and South Korea
                        have agreed:</p>
                    <p>(a) On the three principles on which reunification should be based,
                        namely:</p>
                    <p>(i.) The reunification of the country must be achieved on the basis of full
                        independence, without recourse to foreign troops and without foreign
                        interference,</p>
                    <p>(ii.) The reunification of the country must be achieved by peaceful
                        means,</p>
                    <p>(iii.) Great national unity must be promoted,</p>
                    <p>(b) To reduce tension, prevent all military conflicts and engage in
                        multilateral exchanges,</p>
                    <p>(c) To establish and put into operation a co-ordination committee for the
                        purpose of solving the problem of reunification,</p>
                    <p>Considering that it is in accordance with the principles of the United
                        Nations Charter to encourage to the utmost the <pb n="2" xml:id="d158-02" facs="d158-02"/>solution of the question of the reunification of Korea
                        by the Korean people themselves, on the basis of full independence and by
                        peaceful means, in conformity with the principles of national
                        self-determination,</p>
                    <p>1. Decides to suspend the activities of the United Nations Commission for the
                        Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea;</p>
                    <p>2. Considers that the right to use the United Nations flag, a right which has
                        been conferred on the foreign troops stationed in South Korea, should be
                        annulled;</p>
                    <p>3. Expresses the hope that North and South Korea will successfully pursue the
                        political negotiations already under way in order to conclude a peace
                        agreement, to bring about a reduction in armaments and, finally, to achieve
                        as quickly as possible the independent and peaceful reunification of the
                        country;</p>
                    <p>4. Considers that all foreign troops stationed in South Korea should be
                        withdrawn so that more thorough measures may be taken with a view to
                        securing a durable peace in Korea and expediting independent and peaceful
                        reunification;</p>
                    <p>5. Appeals to all the countries of the world to refrain from military
                        intervention in Korea and from interference in any form whatsoever in its
                        internal affairs.</p>

                    <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                    <p>September 26, 1972</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on September 25, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Chinese Mission at approximately 7:00 p.m., where I was greeted
                        by Mrs. Shih and escorted to a room on the second floor. Mrs. Shih served
                        tea and exchanged pleasantries.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih informed me that the Ambassador would not be able to attend since
                        they just returned from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> where they
                        heard Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' speech. I
                        asked what she thought of the speech; Mrs. Shih said although we have our
                        differences, she thought the speech was well organized and to the point.
                        Mrs. Shih then asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> was
                        traveling. I said he was, without mentioning where or when.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih then presented the note (attached) and asked me to read it. After
                        reading it, I said there were no questions and that I would deliver it as
                        soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih then turned the conversation back to generalities and asked when
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> was leaving and if
                        his replacement had been named. I replied General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> would leave before the end of the
                        year and his replacement has not been named.</p>
                    <p>After additional pleasantries, I departed the Mission at 7:20 p.m. and
                        telephoned General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> with a
                        gist of the note.</p>
                    <p>* * * *</p>
                    <p>For what it's worth, the following is additional background on Mrs. Shih:</p>
                    <p>— She has a 3 1/2 year old daughter who is staying with her sister in
                        Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>— Her husband is with the Mission in New York. He speaks fluent French, some
                        Spanish, and a little English. Mrs. Shih said her French was only fair since
                        the members of the French Mission with whom she deals prefer to speak
                        English.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FVJ1">V. James Fazio</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>Situation Room</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d159-02" facs="d159-02"/>
                    <p>The Chinese side expresses the following' views on the Soviet proposal
                        concerning non-use of force in international relations and permanent
                        prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> inquired about during the
                        September 19 meeting:</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet proposal is a hoax aimed at hoodwinking public opinion and
                        masking its policy of nuclear monopoly and nuclear threat.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chinese side has always stood for strict differentiation between the
                        aggressor and the victim of aggression, and opposed sweeping generalization
                        on the nonuse of force. In international relations, it is imperative for
                        states to first of all commit themselves to respect for the sovereignty and
                        territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
                        non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and
                        mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence; only on this basis can there be
                        any talk of renunciation of the use or threat of force in resolving
                        international disputes. This has already been affirmed in the Sino-U.S.
                        Joint Communique. In its proposal, the Soviet Union advocates without
                        stating any conditions that in a nuclear age mankind has no other way than
                        peaceful coexistence of states, advertises indiscriminate nonuse of force,
                        and preaches as a claptrap the permanent <pb n="3" xml:id="d159-03" facs="d159-03"/>prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. Its purpose
                        is essentially to get the people of all countries to meekly submit to its
                        nuclear-supported expansionism. This is utterly unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>3. China has long stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction
                        of nuclear weapons and for reaching, as the first step, an agreement on the
                        non-use of nuclear weapons. In appearance, the Soviet proposal calls for
                        permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, yet it eludes the
                        question of destruction of nuclear weapons. That is to say, they want to
                        keep nuclear weapons permanently in their hands and improve and develop them
                        continuously. That is a cheap diplomatic trick, to which China will never
                        agree.</p>
                    <p>4. The Chinese side has noted that the U.S. side does not agree to the Soviet
                        proposal out of its own considerations. The Chinese side wishes to inform
                        the U.S. side that the Chinese Delegation will expose and refute that
                        proposal during the debate at the current session of the U.N. General
                        Assembly.</p>

                    <p>SECTO 65</p>
                    <p>1. THE SECRETARY GAVE SMALL INFORMAL DINNER FOR VICE FOREIGN MINISTER
                            <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Ch'iao Kuan-hua</persName> AT HIS NEW YORK
                        APARTMENT EVENING OCTOBER 5. AMBASSADOR BUSH AND AMBASSADOR
                            <persName>Huang</persName> HUA PARTICIPATED. INTERPRETER SHEN JO-YUN AND
                        EA/ACA DIRECTOR <persName>Jenkins</persName> ALSO PRESENT. OCCASION WAS
                        PRIMARILY SOCIAL, WAS RELAXED AND EXTREMELY CONVIVIAL. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES
                        DISCUSSED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS, PUNCTUATED BY HUMOROUS ASIDES OFTEN RELATED
                        TO ALLEGED GEOGRAPHICAL ALLEGIANCES AND QUOTE PROVINCIALISMS UNQUOTE OF
                        THOSE PRESENT. THE SECRETARY EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE VICE INISTER WOULD
                        TRAVEL TO OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES, INASMUCH AS NEW YORK WAS NOT
                        CONSIDERED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION. Ch'iao SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD
                        TO DOING THIS AS SOON AS THE SITUATION MADE IT APPROPRIATE. Ch'iao WAS
                        ASSURED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM IN HIS TRAVELS SO FAR AS THE UNITED
                        STATES SIDE WAS CONCERNED.</p>
                    <p>2. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">BUSH</persName>, Ch'iao SAID THE CHINESE THEMSELVES DID NOT KNOW WHAT
                        THE POPULATION OF CHINA WAS TODAY BUT THE FIGURE 800 MILLION HAD OFTEN BEEN
                        USED. HE SAID THEY WERE MAKING EARNEST ATTEMPTS AT POPULATION CONTROL. SOME
                        PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE LARGE CITIES BUT MOST OF THE POPULATION LIVED
                        IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND BETTER HYGIENE AND VASTLY INCREASED MEDICAL
                        FACILITIES HAD EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE
                        MORTALITY RATE.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d160-02" facs="d160-02"/>
                    <p>3. BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED PLEASURE THAT PROVISIONS OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE
                        WERE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN A HIGHLY SATISFACTORY MANNER AND AT AN APPROPRIATE
                        RATE OF PROGRESS. THE SECRETARY NOTED THAT THE MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN SINO-US
                        RELATIONS HAD MET WITH VIRTUALLY UNIVERSAL APPROVAL IN OUR COUNTRY. Ch'iao
                        READILY AGREED THAT THIS WAS THE CASE. AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">BUSH</persName> EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE MANNER
                        IN WHICH THE CHINESE. AND THE <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> UN MISSIONS
                        HAD WORKED TOGETHER WITH SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE. HE SAID THAT WE NATURALLY
                        HAD OUR DIFFERENCES WHICH WE FREELY EXPRESSED, BUT THAT WE WERE BUILDING
                        VERY SATISFACTORILY ON THE COMMON GROUND WHICH WE HAD FOUND.</p>
                    <p>4. THE SECRETARY OBSERVED THAT THE RECENT VISIT OF PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> TO PEKING SEEMED TO HAVE GONE VERY
                        WELL. HE THOUGHT THERE WAS GENERAL SATISFACTION IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THIS WAS
                        SO. THE VICE MINISTER SAID THAT CHINA AND JAPAN HAD A LONG HISTORY OF
                        ASSOCIATION AND THAT MUCH COMMON GROUND WAS FOUND IN THE RECENT SUMMIT
                        MEETING. NATURALLY, THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BUT REAL PROGRESS HAD BEEN
                        MADE.</p>
                    <p>5. THE SECRETARY IN CONGRATULATING THE VICE MINISTER ON HIS LINGUISTIC
                        PROWESS REMINDED HIM THAT IN PEKING WE HAD AGREED THAT EACH SIDE COULD
                        PROFIT FROM HELP FROM THE OTHER. IN LANGUAGE STUDY, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS
                        UPON CONTEMPORARY USAGE. Ch'iao WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE COLLECTING MATERIALS
                        WHICH WE HOPED THE CHINESE WOULD FIND USEFUL IN THIS FIELD.</p>
                    <p>6. AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">BUSH</persName> ASKED HOW THE
                        CHINESE VIEWED THE AMERICAN PARTICIPATION IN THE SPRING CANTON TRADE FAIR.
                        FOR OUR PART, WE THOUGHT IT VERY SATISFACTORY. Ch'iao AGREED AND SAID THAT
                        MORE AMERICANS WOULD BE INVITED TO THE FALL TRADE FAIR. BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED
                        SATISFACTION AT THE MANNER IN WHICH TRADE WAS DEVELOPING AND LOOKED FORWARD
                        TO FURTHER PROGRESS.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d160-03" facs="d160-03"/>
                    <p>7. THE SECRETARY MENTIONED SEVERAL POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN OUR TWO
                        COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES. THE VICE MINISTER SAID THAT HE FOUND OUR HABIT OF
                        QUOTE KIDDING OURSELVES UNQUOTE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE, AND EVIDENCE OF
                        SOCIAL HEALTH. HE CONGRATULATED THE U.S. SIDE FOR HAVING INTRODUCED INTO THE
                        SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THE CONCEPT THAT NO NATION IS INFALLIBLE. HE THOUGH THAT
                        BOTH CHINA AND AMERICA WERE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO BRING ABOUT IMPROVEMENT IN
                        MANY FIELDS. THIS PREVENTED COMPLACENCY WHICH WOULD START ANY NATION ON A
                        DOWNWARD PATH.</p>
                    <p>8. AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">BUSH</persName> EXPRESSED
                        APPRECIATION FOR SIMILARITIES IN CHINESE AND AMERICAN OBJECTIVES WITH
                        RESPECT TO THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM, ALTHOUGH WE HAD A FEW DIFFERENCES
                        PERHAPS IN OUR METHODOLOGY. Ch'iao DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT.</p>
                    <p>9. Ch'iao, INTRODUCING THE ONLY SUBJECT SPECIFICALLY RAISED BY THE CHINESE,
                        ASKED THE SECRETARY TO GIVE QUOTE NON-POLITICAL UNQUOTE OPINIONS OF CONCORDE
                        AIRCRAFT. THE SECRETARY SAID WE HAD NO REASON TO CRITICIZE IT. ITS
                        CONFIGURATION WAS PLEASING .AND WE BELIEVED ITS TECHNOLOGY WAS SOUND, BUT WE
                        HAD SOME DOUBTS AS TO ITS COST EFFECTIVENESS SINCE IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE. IT
                        MIGHT BE FEASIBLE FOR LONG HAULS. WE THOUGHT THE SONIC BOOM PROBLEM WAS
                        MANAGEABLE AND WE HAD PLANS OF OUR OWN TO JOIN IN THE SECOND GENERATION OF
                        SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT.</p>
                    <p>10. NEITHER VIETNAM NOR TAIWAN WAS MENTIONED.</p>
                    <p>11. TENOR OF ENTIRE EVENING WAS QUOTE SO FAR SO GOOD UNQUOTE IN SINO-US
                        RELATIONS. DIFFERENCES WERE BEING FACED FORTHRIGHTLY BUT, FOR THE MOST PART,
                        WERE BEING SET ASIDE IN FAVOR OF CONCENTRATING ON CONSTRUCTIVE POTENTIAL IN
                        ENLARGING COMMON GROUND. IT WAS AGREED THAT SUCH CANDOR WAS BEST FOUNDATION
                        FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS, WHICH BOTH SIDES CONFIDENTLY
                        EXPECTED.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d160-04" facs="d160-04"/>
                    <p>12. BOTH SIDES HAD AGREED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO COMMENT TO THE MEDIA PRIOR
                        TO THE DINNER. THERE WAS, HOWEVER, A LEAK (OUR INFORMATION ATTRIBUTE IT TO
                        THE CHINESE SIDE) AND THERE WAS A SMALL REPRESENTATION FROM THE PRESS ON
                        ARRIVAL OF THE CHINESE PARTY AND SOME DOZEN WERE PRESENT ON DEPARTURE. THIS
                        DID NOT SEEM TO DISTURB THE CHINESE AND MAY WELL HAVE ACCORDED WITH THEIR
                        UNEXPRESSED WISHES.</p>
                    <p>13. DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO DOWNGRADE AND GIVE BROADER DISTRIBUTION.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>The following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission
                        in New York on October 12, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Mission at 3:45 p.m. and was greeted by Mrs. Shih and escorted
                        to the second floor. Tea was served and pleasantries exchanged.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih asked when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        would be returning, and I told her he should be back by the time I returned.
                        Mrs. Shih then presented the note (attached) and asked if there were any
                        questions. I said the note was clear and I would pass it on as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>In the course of conversation, Mrs. Shih mentioned that a Chinese medical
                        delegation was due to arrive in New York today (Thursday) and then proceed
                        to Washington on Friday.</p>
                    <p>I left the Mission at 4:05 p.m. and telephoned the gist of the message to
                        Col. <persName>Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>

                        danced away from this one but in the future, Mrs. Shih should be at the door
                        at the appropriate time to assist entry.</p>

                    <p>1. The Chinese side agrees in principle to the idea put forward by Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on October 3 about the
                        U.S. side sending a mission to China to discuss the prospects of the
                        normalization of Sino-U.S. relations. Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> welcomes Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to come personally again on this mission to China.
                        The specific date of the visit can be discussed and decided upon through
                        this channel after being suggested by the U.S. side.</p>
                    <p>2. The U.S. side is aware of the position of the Chinese side on the Viet Nam
                        question. The Chinese side hopes that the U.S. and Vietnamese sides will be
                        able to reach an agreement on the settlement of the Viet Nam question.</p>

                    <p>October 9, 1972</p>
                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on October 8, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Chinese Mission at approximately 1:45 p.m. and was greeted by
                        Mrs. Shih and escorted to the second floor. Mrs. Shih served tea and
                        exchanged pleasantries.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih said the Ambassador would not be present since he was involved with
                        the Vice Foreign Minister's visit. I presented the package (attached) and
                        asked Mrs. Shih to read it, should there be any questions.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih gave it a quick perusal, commenting she had read both proposals
                        earlier. However, she read the last paragraph of the next-to-last page
                        several times. She said there were no questions and promised to deliver the
                        package as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>The conversation turned to generalities and I commented that the Mission now
                        had both police and plainclothes guards at their door. (On previous

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on October 25, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Chinese Mission at 4:30 p.m., was met by Mrs. Shih and escorted
                        to the second floor. Tea was served and pleasantries exchanged.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih presented the note (Tab A) which I read and said I would deliver as
                        soon as possible. I then presented Mrs. Shih with our note (Tab B). Mrs.
                        Shih read it very carefully, said she had no questions and would pass it to
                        the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>I then delivered the oral message from <gloss target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss>
                        inviting the Vice Foreign Minister and the Ambassador to dinner on November

                        and that details and composition of the party would be passed on by

                        and said she would relay the invitation.</p>
                    <p>General conversation followed and I departed the Mission at 4:55 p.m.,

                    <p>The U.S. side sent the attached message to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side today, October 25, 1972.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side has also clarified for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                        side that paragraph 4(c) means that the final agreement would be arrived at
                        in the Paris meeting proposed in paragraph 4(a) and would not be subject to
                        subsequent change; and that the reference to two weeks in 4(c) applies to
                        the period needed to finalize preparations for the signing and
                        implementation of the agreement.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d163-03" facs="d163-03"/>
                    <p>MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> ON
                        BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. side has studied the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> message
                        of October 24 with the greatest attention. It shares the regret of the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side that a brief delay in the
                        original schedule has become necessary.</p>
                    <p>2. At the same time, the U.S. side is of the view that the constant
                        repetition of unfounded charges can only exacerbate the problem. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> must realize the impossibility for the U.S.
                        of signing a document which asserts the concurrence of one of the parties
                        when this concurrence does not exist.</p>
                    <p>3. The problem which has now arisen requires statesmanship on both sides. The
                        U.S. sides prepared to work seriously and with good will to give effect to
                        the understandings reached with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                        certainly before the end of November. To this end some cooperation by the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side is essential.</p>
                    <p>4. To show its good will, the U.S repeats its undertakings in its note of
                        October 24 and adds some additional ones as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. Special Advisor <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> should
                        meet Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Paris on any
                        day of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s choosing during the week of
                        October 30 to arrive at a final text. (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will be prepared to meet Special <pb n="4" xml:id="d163-04" facs="d163-04"/>Advisor Le Duc Tho at any other
                        location. However, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side should
                        consider that another locale might exacerbate the situation which produced
                        the necessity for the meeting in the first place.)</p>
                    <p>b. The U.S. wishes to reiterate its conviction that the necessary changes can
                        all be accomplished within the framework of the existing agreement.</p>
                    <p>c. The U.S. side would make itself responsible for the document growing out
                        of this meeting without further change within a reasonable period to be
                        agreed—say, two weeks.</p>
                    <p>d. As soon as the document is completed in Paris and while the U.S. consults
                        its allies, the U.S. will stop completely the bombing of the North.</p>
                    <p>e. As soon as the necessary concurrence is achieved, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will come to Hanoi to discuss the
                        post-war situation and to initial the agreement (around November 20).</p>
                    <p>f. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will attend another
                        meeting with Special Advisor Le Duc Tho with instructions to bring about a
                        final settlement.</p>
                    <p>5. It should be obvious that the U.S. side is showing the most serious and
                        earnest desire to bring about a resolution of the difficulties which have
                        arisen. It is equally obvious that the United <pb n="5" xml:id="d163-05" facs="d163-05"/>States can go no further. It is up to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to decide whether to sacrifice all that has
                        been achieved by a policy of public villification and private intransigence.
                        For the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to insist on demands beyond the
                        power of the U.S. to fulfill will permit no other conclusion than that it
                        seeks a pretext for prolonging the conflict.</p>
                    <p>6. As for the U.S., the course adopted during the private meetings in October
                        represents settled U.S. policy. The U.S. is determined to end the war in the
                        nearest future, and it will work with the greatest energy to remove the
                        obstacles that have arisen in any event before the end of November.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on October 27, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Chinese Mission at 8:40 p.m., was met by Mrs. Shih, and
                        escorted to the second floor. Tea was served and pleasantries exchanged.</p>
                    <p>I presented the notes to Mrs. Shih (attached) which she carefully read and
                        had no questions.</p>
                    <p>In the subsequent conversation, Mrs. Shih said that the November 1 date
                        suggested for dinner was acceptable to the Vice Foreign Minister and the
                        Ambassador. She asked if I knew who would be accompanying Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I said I didn't know, and took
                        the opportunity to inform Mrs. Shih that a specific number of guests was not
                        necessary. The Vice Foreign Minister and Ambassador were welcome to come
                        themselves, or to include in their party any members of the Mission they
                        desired. Mrs. Shih said she would await a call from <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston Lord</persName> to finalize the date and
                        details.</p>
                    <p>I departed the Mission at 9:00 p.m. and telephoned Jon Howe with the details

                    <p>The U.S. side has studied most carefully the October 26, 1972, message from
                        the DRVN side. As the U.S. side has already pointed out, it understands the
                        disappointment caused by the inability to meet the schedule. At the same
                        time, the DRVN side certainly has sufficient information to know that the
                        U.S. side exerted maximum efforts to adhere to the timetable, The U.S. side
                        wishes to reaffirm its belief that with a cooperative attitude and good will
                        on both sides, all remaining obstacles can be overcome. The major problem
                        now is to focus on the future and to end recriminations about the past.
                        Public pressure tactics can only retard progress.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side has proposed another meeting in Paris to expedite the
                        conclusion of the agreement, whose essential provisions Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reaffirmed in his October 26,
                        1972 press conference. With respect to paragraph 4 of the October 26, 1972,
                        DRVN message, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side recommends that
                        Special Advisor Le Due Tho and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> meet in Paris beginning on Wednesday, November 1,
                        1972, or any other mutually convenient date. The U.S. side wishes to point
                        out that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will not be
                        available between November 4 and November 9. The session would last as long
                        as required to complete the final text, The U.S. side hopes that the North
                        Vietnamese side would attend with the attitude of making a positive
                        contribution to achieving a satisfactory final text and that it will
                        cooperate in the subsequent effort to achieve the concurrence of all
                        parties. This goal is in the common interest and would permit rapid progress
                        towards a ceasefire.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. side reaffirms that upon agreement on a text in Paris—and while
                        subsequent consultations are occurring it will stop completely the bombing
                        of North Vietnam. The U.S. also agrees not to request any additional changes
                        after agreement is reached at the next session. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Special Advisor <persName corresp="#p_LDT1">Le Duc Tho</persName> will also agree on a schedule
                        which can certainly be maintained since all preliminary consultations will
                        have been completed and plans to bring about final concurrence will have
                        been made well in advance. The U.S. side also reaffirms that as soon as the
                        necessary concurrence is achieved, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will come to Hanoi to discuss the post-war
                        situation and to initial the agreement. The target date is November 20.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side agrees with the DRVN side that an early end to the war and
                        restoration of peace in Vietnam will usher in a new era in the relations
                        between the United States and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>

                    <p>MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DRV ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
                        STATES</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. side has consistently sought to end the war as rapidly as
                        possible and on a basis just to all.</p>
                    <p>2. It is for this reason that it accepted the accelerated schedule proposed
                        by Special Advisor Le Duc Tho, even though it required extreme efforts and
                        the risk of some delays caused by the reaction of allies who did not
                        participate in the drafting process. If the United States had wanted a
                        pretext for delay as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> alleges it
                        could easily have protracted the negotiations on the details of the
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States had always made clear that it had to consult its allies
                        before the agreement would be considered final. The U.S. has always
                        respected the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s position in that regard;
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> cannot ignore the U.S. convictions
                        about its principles. That principled stand will also be a guarantee for the
                        improved relations between the U.S. and the DRV which will certainly begin
                        in the nearest future.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is aware that once agreement in
                        principle had been reached the U.S. unilaterally and without any reciprocity
                        significantly reduced its bombing of the north.</p>
                    <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> cannot be ignorant of the
                        strenuous effort made by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Saigon—efforts complicated by the interview
                        given <pb n="2" xml:id="d165-02" facs="d165-02"/>simultaneously by the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Prime Minister who alleged an
                        agreement had already been reached while it was still being negotiated and
                        who publicly called irrelevant the very government and leaders whose
                        concurrence was being sought by common agreement.</p>
                    <p>6. True to its principles and as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out to Special Advisor Le Duc Tho on
                        October 11 and to Minister <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName>
                        on October 17, it could not guarantee acceptance of the proposed time table
                        by Saigon. A four party agreement obviously requires the agreement of all
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>7. Since a discussion of the past is fruitless, the United States now feels
                        bound by its principles to request one more meeting between Special Advisor
                        Le Duc Tho and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in Paris
                        on any day of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s choosing during the
                        week of October 30.</p>
                    <p>8. At this meeting, it is necessary to discuss three sets of issues:</p>
                    <p>a. Technical changes which do not change the substance of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>b. Some modifications in which the Vietnamese language seems to produce a
                        different meaning than the English text, espcially with respect to paragraph
                        9g.</p>
                    <p>c. Some modifications which were always foreseen to take account of the
                        possible necessity of a [unclear].</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d165-03" facs="d165-03"/>
                    <p>d. An additional discussion of troop dispositions outside the text of the
                        agreement to insure its workability.</p>
                    <p>e. Efforts to make the ceasefires in Indo-China more nearly simultaneous with
                        each other and with the coming into being of the supervisory machinery.</p>
                    <p>9. All these changes are minor compared to what has already been surmounted
                        and many are in practice already agreed. The U.S. side will approach these
                        discussions with the determination that they should finally conclude the
                        negotiations. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will be
                        instructed to stay in Paris till this is accomplished.</p>
                    <p>10. To show its good will, the U.S. gives the following undertakings:</p>
                    <p>a. The U.S. declares that the text developed at the next private meeting will
                        be final. The U.S. makes itself responsible for the fact that no additional
                        changes will be raised. It will give this undertaking as well to the allies
                        of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>b. A schedule will be agreed at that meeting which, now that consultations
                        have been completed, can be considered firm.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. will, in the meantime, stop all bombardment north of the 20th
                        parallel.</p>
                    <p>11. The U.S. is determined to end the war rapidly and to begin a new era in
                        its relations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> moving from
                        hostility to <pb n="4" xml:id="d165-04" facs="d165-04"/>friendship. It is up
                        to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to decide whether to use the
                        pretext of understandable disappointments to continue a conflict which has
                        no further objective or whether to seize this opportunity to move toward
                        normalcy, reciprocity and cooperation.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION</p>
                    <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Monday, November 13, 1972, 7:30-l0:00 p.m.</p>
                    <p>PLACE: Century Club, New York City</p>
                    <p>(The evening's conversation went back and forth between social talk and
                        substantive discussion. This memcon recounts all the substantive exchanges.
                        The Chinese party arrived at 7:30 p.m. and drinks were consumed for half an
                        hour before dinner. The Vice Minister presented Governor Rockefeller with a
                        Chinese vase, gave a smaller one to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and another artifact to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>, together with tea and mao tai for
                        all the Americans. After a few minutes of light banter the following
                        discussion ensued before dinner.)</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d166-02" facs="d166-02"/>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We should drink a toast to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> upon his return. (To Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>) How do things stand?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are as I explained
                        last time to your Ambassador. We will meet next week as you know. We will
                        have about four or five substantive changes and eight to ten technical
                        points, of the kind we discussed the other evening. If <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> shows the same attitude as previously we
                        should be able to come to agreement. Then if the North Vietnamese show some
                        patience and understanding for our needs, in two to three weeks at the most
                        we should be able to bring Saigon along. Everything should be done by
                        December 10. We will not ask for any more changes after the next meeting.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> made some progress in
                        Saigon. After the meeting next week I will go back to Saigon, and we will
                        complete the discussions.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: You mean you first go to Paris and then to Saigon?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will be honest. The
                        mistake I made last time was to go to Saigon with a very brief deadline. The
                        disadvantage was that as time went on our negotiating position got weaker.
                        It was a very embarrassing position. Therefore, we now want an interval
                        after Paris so that next time we can prepare gradually. We may send General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> back again. We will apply
                        influence ahead of the time that I return to Saigon.</p>
                    <p>In Paris, if Hanoi deals with us in the same farsighted spirit, we will
                        settle next week in principle and then return to Washington for a week. We
                        will apply pressures from here rather than while I am in Saigon. That is the
                        only thing that makes sense. Therefore patience and silence from Hanoi is
                        needed. It is no good to claim victory while we are influencing Saigon. But
                        it will be done and we will succeed. I will go to Saigon the first of
                        December after a week in Washington. Our target date is December 8 or 9.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: (To General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>) Was there some change in the attitude in Saigon after
                        you went there?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes. There was
                        considerable change, considerable progress. There are still some differences
                        on one area.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d166-03" facs="d166-03"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Really on two
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Well, two.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The big difficulty is
                        the presence of North Vietnamese troops in the South. If that can be solved,
                        everything else will be easy. We understand the problem of Hanoi. They do
                        not wish to admit their forces are in the South and then withdraw them,
                        which is a double humiliation. But on the other hand, it is very difficult
                        for Saigon to make peace and to recognize the right of the North Vietnamese
                        forces to be on its territory. So we have to look for some practical
                        solution. I indicated to the Ambassador the direction we are thinking about,
                        that North Vietnam withdraw some forces - they don't need to tell us, we can
                        pick it up from intelligence. Second, there is already in the agreement now
                        a provision for demobilization of forces. <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan
                            Thuy</persName> referred to it in the New York Times That provision can
                        be strengthened and made a little bit more explicit. After a ceasefire the
                        two parties can negotiate a reduction in forces. I think the combination of
                        those two measures would succeed in breaking the difficulties.</p>
                    <p>There is one other thing that can be done - one of those complicated formulas
                        that we use (Vice Minister Chiao laughs heartily). We can say that all
                        Vietnamese agree that … What we can do, for example, we can have a protocol
                        in which we note all the things the North Vietnamese say, that the only
                        forces in the South are South Vietnamese or South Vietnamese who went North
                        and returned. We can acknowledge these statements and say we do not
                        recognize the right of the North Vietnamese to go South. They don't claim to
                        have this right. This and the other measures would satisfy Saigon.</p>
                    <p>Either Hanoi will keep the agreement, in which case it won't matter how many
                        troops they have in the South, or Hanoi will break the agreement, in which
                        case we have the U.S. Air Force in Thailand and will take drastic action. I
                        assume the same factors in North Vietnam which made it make peace will work
                        against the starting of the war again. We are prepared to see an evolution
                        take place. We are not children. We are students of history, and know the
                        revolution will not stop on December 10. But it is in no one's interest to
                        see things forced, particularly at a time when we are making decisions that
                        are going to be unpopular, so that confidence in our leadership is not
                        shaken.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d166-04" facs="d166-04"/>
                    <p>You were present when I was with the Prime Minister. Everything we said in
                        June we reaffirm. We will not increase our demands. We will not break the
                        ceasefire. We will not seek any military solution there. We will not stand
                        in the way of a historical political process. I think the question of the
                        forces in the South should be shifted to the political arena, and if this is
                        done, all things will be possible.</p>
                    <p>I think the Vice Minister understands everything I say in English.</p>
                    <p>Governor Rockefeller: He gets two shots at what you are saying.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Not exactly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One major point—we will
                        use our strength gained through the elections to end the war, not to
                        prosecute it. The Prime Minister should understand we want to end the war so
                        that we can turn to the bigger things that we have discussed.</p>
                    <p>(At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested
                        that they go into dinner and the party moved to the round table in the same
                        room where a lengthy cordial dinner ensued for a couple of hours. Most of
                        the dinner was taken up with substantive discussion which is recorded below.
                        There were also brief interludes of lighter conversation.)</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Although we had some heated discussions [in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>] there was always a good feeling.</p>
                    <p>Governor Rockefeller: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        returned with a deep respect and affection for his counterparts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It was important work.
                        We have established a good relationship with China, and we have every
                        intention of accelerating it in the new Administration.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We all stated the facts.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: You can't go
                        wrong with the facts, even at the local level. I am a provincial leader.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="d166-05" facs="d166-05"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Ambassador
                            [<persName>Huang</persName>] taught me a lesson {in July 1971] when we
                        were negotiating the communique about the President's visit to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. I have not told him this yet. My only
                        experience had been with your northern ally.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: My old friend.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We tried the same
                        method we used with them, which the Communists usually follow, i.e., to
                        present very extreme demands. I suggested that each side present its maximum
                        position - we present ours, you present yours - and then we would start
                        negotiating. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> said,
                        no, that is not the way to do it. He believed that each side should state
                        what it honestly must have and then the two sides could find words easily.
                        This is what we did. This is how it happened. You know the Russians would
                        prefer to have a worse agreement with some concessions from the other side
                        than to have a better agreement. They insist on extreme demands.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Is this
                        technique for public consumption or for self-gratification?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: With the Chinese, for
                        example, you would start out with $750 million and end up with $725 million.
                        With the Russians if you started out with 800 million they would settle for
                        $776 million, but they would take it as a victory because they got you down
                        25 million dollars worth.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Mr. Vice
                        Minister, it's a sign of inward insecurity.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: With respect to the negotiations on the boundary
                        question with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Which system is
                        used - the Russian or the Chinese?</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: (to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>) You had some successful negotiations with them. I
                        have not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They're not as afraid
                        of me as they are of you.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d166-06" facs="d166-06"/>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: As Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        knows, the negotiations on the borders have gone on for over three years,
                        and I was directly engaged for two years. The negotiations started in 1969
                        after agreement was reached between the two Prime Ministers in Peking on the
                        principles. What are the present state of the borders between China and the
                        Soviet Union which were established in mid, or the latter part of the, 19th
                        century? China and Czarist Russia concluded a series of unequal treaties. At
                        that time China was in a very weak position. In the unequal treaties there
                        were simply no surveys. They just used pencils and drew lines on the map.
                        That was the way the boundaries were decided. Accordingly, in these unequal
                        treaties problems arose because in certain sections of the treaties they did
                        not stipulate very clearly the borders between China and Russia in these
                        disputed areas. The Soviet side say these belong to them, and we say that
                        they belong to us.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You do not challenge
                        the treaties themselves?</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: No. All propaganda to the contrary is groundless. Some
                        people say the Chinese want to abrogate the unequal treaties and recover all
                        the land seized by Russia. These are groundless and not the position of the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: That's very
                        interesting.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: So in 1969, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet
                        Union, came to Peking and <pb n="7" xml:id="d166-07" facs="d166-07"/>Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> talked to him on the
                        boundary question. He said the problems between the two countries should be
                        settled and that negotiations should be held, first, free from any threat
                        and, secondly, proceeding from the basis of taking the SinoRussian treaties
                        on the border as the basis, while at the same time [recognizing that] some
                        disputed areas along the Sino-Russian border exist. From this basic point
                        should proceed negotiations of the question. At that time I was present.
                        Chairman Kosygin then asked, what are the disputed areas? Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> gave him an explanation of what
                        I said just now. He said, now I understand. Some places you claim are yours,
                        and some we claim are ours. The Premier told him that his understanding was
                        correct. Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> said, in
                        order for the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the border questions to be
                        conducted free from any threat and through peaceful negotiations, that:
                        there should be three points with regard to the provisions of the agreement.
                        First, one should maintain the status quo of the border. This is a very
                        clear point and needs no explanation. Second, the two sides should avert
                        armed conflict. The third point is that for the disputed areas, which they
                        claim and we claim, the armed forces of both sides must be withdrawn and
                        disengaged. Premier Kosygin said he was in full accord.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know your
                        experience but our troubles usually start at that point.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Exactly. That's where the trouble starts. So the
                        problem follows. There was agreement at that time. Premier Kosygin said that
                        we should write down the points on paper. Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> said that could be done, and Premier Kosygin
                        asked how many days it would take to put it down on paper. Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> asked him how many days he
                        wanted. Premier Kosygin said one week. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-ial</persName> said all right and within one week we gave them a
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>When the paper was given to them, they said that these questions should be
                        discussed when negotiations start on the boundary question. We agreed and
                        the negotiations on the boundary question started, and I played a most
                        unhappy role. I was in the negotiations for two years and now the
                        negotiations are going on for more than three years. And I washed my hands
                        of it last year.</p>
                    <p>And recently on the question of the non-use of force or threat of force,
                        including conventional weapons, missiles, and nuclear weapons, we thought
                        negotiations should be conducted free from any threat of force. So we put
                        forward the proposition that both sides should refrain from doing so. This
                        is in the provisional agreement that we proposed, one of the provisions in
                        the provisional agreement. Because, if between China and the Soviet Union
                        there is any chance of armed conflict, the main problem is with the border
                        question.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d166-08" facs="d166-08"/>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Right.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: And the greatest danger is these disputed areas. The
                        two sides maintain armed forces in these areas, so the forces of the two
                        sides should disengage.</p>
                    <p>Three years have passed in the negotiations, and no results have been
                        achieved. What I'm going to tell you is something new, that is, recently, in
                        early November, the Soviet Union all of a sudden changed its attitude.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Very
                        interesting.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: They proposed that we should leave aside other
                        questions and only talk about the non-use of force, of conventional and
                        nuclear weapons and keep this issue separate from the boundary question. On
                        the one hand, they are not recognizing that there are disputed areas of the
                        Sino-Soviet border. On the other band, they are fundamentally opposed to
                        withdrawing their forces from the disputed areas. But it is very clear why
                        they fear so much the disputed areas—once they recognize that there are
                        disputed areas along the Sino-Soviet border, there will be a chain reaction
                        concerning other boundaries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: From their other
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: They try to lasso us by abstract provisions which have
                        nothing to do with reality, such as the non-use of force.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you accept this
                        point, it has a relationship to other strategy of theirs which may come
                        along in the next two or three years. It seems to fit into the general
                        strategy of the proposals they are making to us.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Please listen to me. We refused in November.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You just refused.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Yes. I wanted you to know this piece of information. If
                        anybody tells you that China and the Soviet Union have reached agreement on
                        the non-use of force, including nuclear and conventional weapons, that is
                        unfounded. It is nonsense. You should not believe them. You know our
                        character and what we say is honest.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d166-09" facs="d166-09"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have always been
                        able to rely on your word. I hope you can always rely on our word. Any
                        information we receive from the Soviet Union on its relations with you, we
                        will check with you. It would be useful if you check with us anything on our
                        relations with them that you get from them. We will generally give the
                        information. If you haven't heard from us, the chances are it is not true.
                        We will reach no understandings with the Soviet Union without your knowing
                        about it. This is a fixed principle of this Administration.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: And I believe since your visit to China relations
                        between our two countries have been according to this principle. We may have
                        difficulties. We may have very heated discussions, for example, in
                        Hangchow—I don't know whether you remember or not.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You took a half-hour
                        interval to prepare a speech, but you had provocation.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: No. As we have always done, I wanted to tell you this
                        information.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate this very
                        much because, no doubt, we will hear a more complex version in the not too
                        distant future.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: So I wanted to tell you in advance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In this connection, we
                        will be under considerable pressure in the next month on the nuclear treaty,
                        of which we gave you the text, but we will proceed with the strategy that we
                        have told you about, of avoiding any commitment to it. We will do it in a
                        complex way without ever actually refusing it. But you can be certain that
                        we will not accept it, and we will keep you informed about any new proposal
                        we receive.</p>
                    <p>Of course, I want to discuss this whole subject with the Prime Minister when
                        I see him in January.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I would publish all their thoughts so that they will be
                        discredited before the world. <pb n="10" xml:id="d166-10" facs="d166-10"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have a good
                        intelligence system. You know when I leave my office. You will recall
                        Bangladesh.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: The New York Times did not take my word.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: You should take
                        the New York Times the whole organization, with you.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Do you have any specific requests with respect to your
                        visit to China next January?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: First, I thought I
                        would come around January 6, if this is convenient for you. I thought we
                        might discuss first of all the evolution in our bilateral relations. I am
                        assuming we will have finished the war in Vietnam so that we can then make a
                        schedule for normalization of our relationships. Then I might put before the
                        Prime Minister and you our views on how we envision the next four years and
                        listen to any advice you choose to give us, particularly concerning the
                        problem I discussed with the Ambassador. It is not inconceivable that the
                        maximum dangers of the hegemonial designs that we discussed, and both
                        pledged to oppose in the Shanghai Communique, could arise from 1974 onward.
                        We are determined to oppose this, not out of any consideration for others
                        but for consideration for ourselves.</p>
                    <p>But this is a complex problem for us, and so I thought we might have a very
                        frank exchange on the general subject—which, of course, we hope will not
                        arise in practice.</p>
                    <p>And then we might have our usual exchanges on Indochina. I think it is
                        important that after peace is made there should be a period of tranquility
                        for some years. This is particularly true for Cambodia, where you have a
                        special interest. I frankly think that your interests and ours are similar.
                        You want a neutral, independent Cambodia not dominated by any one country,
                        and this is what we want too. There is no American interest there. We don't
                        care how this is done so long as the evolution is gradual. But
                        unsatisfactory arrangements could affect other relationships. It is very
                        difficult for us to end the war and then have a renewal of war elsewhere
                        because then we are accused of a bad deal that hampers us elsewhere. Our
                        objectives are not dissimilar, if I understand them, and we are not wedded
                        to any particular orientation.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d166-11" facs="d166-11"/>
                    <p>Then we can continue to discuss Europe. Incidentally, I believe the Prime
                        Minister's discussions with European Foreign Ministers (I have seen reports
                        of these) have been very useful from our point of view. I have said that you
                        are the toughest European country (laughter).</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Talking about this question, the question of Cambodia,
                        I will very bluntly ask you one question. Are you prepared to talk to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: While I am there?</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Anyway, do you have any ideas of talking with him?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will speak very
                        candidly. If we can have a period of quiet then there would inevitably have
                        to be some discussions with <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince
                            Sihanouk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We are assuming… our hope is that there will be quiet
                        in Vietnam. Of course, there are many questions. When you go to China in
                        January, if you do have the idea of talking to <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName>, I can arrange it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have not considered
                        it for that period. But I will be very glad to talk to the Prime Minister
                        about Cambodia. I can tell you now on a confidential basis it would be
                        possible to arrive at an understanding with the Prime Minister that does
                        justice to the concerns of <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince
                            Sihanouk</persName>. If the war continues in Cambodia, then we have to
                        maintain in our present position. But what we want in Cambodia, to be very
                        blunt, is to reduce the influence of India and the Soviet Union, and to
                        preserve it from becoming an appendage of Hanoi. Whoever can best preserve
                        it as an independent neutral country, is consistent with our policy, and we
                        believe consistent with yours.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I think that the three Indochinese countries must be
                        independent, but at the same time must have friendly relations among
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There are three
                        countries, but four states for the time being. Vice Minister Ch'iao: <pb n="12" xml:id="d166-12" facs="d166-12"/>Of course, the present status is
                        three countries and four sides. But in the historical process, the South and
                        North of Vietnam will inevitably go toward reunification.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will not oppose
                        this, and we are not opposed to friendly relations among these
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I think Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is aware that there was once a summit meeting of
                        the Indochinese peoples, and they published documents, and the documents set
                        forth their principles.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You left some
                        literature about it in my study in the guest house along with some pictures
                        (Vice Minister Ch'iao: laughs).</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: You reminded me—I was going to give you some documents
                        on the SinoSoviet question. But you must be very busy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will read them.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We had some very happy times, with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, but we had an experience with
                        our old friend which was very unhappy. In Hangchow we had a big quarrel.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, until 5 a.m. There
                        was an agreement the night before, and I wanted to change it. I must say
                        seriously, that we had an agreement the night before and for purely internal
                        American reasons we had to request many changes. They were trivial. This
                        made it extremely hard to explain why we needed another session. It was a
                        great tribute to the Prime Minister and the Vice Foreign Minister that they
                        agreed to reopen the question after a half-hour speech during which what was
                        said was basically correct. We spent until S a. m. for internal American
                        reasons of no interest to China, and not on essential problems. It showed
                        very great generosity on the part of the Chinese. They had already had a
                        meeting of their governing body to approve the wording. Nothing affected the
                        essence; only something in one paragraph. I must say we deeply appreciated
                        this, and it was very important in gaining concurrence among all our people
                        for the communique.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Thank you very much. My theory is that we all reason
                        things out. We must make major accommodation within a framework of
                        principle. I can't impose my ideas on you, nor can you impose your ideas on
                        me. <pb n="13" xml:id="d166-13" facs="d166-13"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There was also human
                        understanding, which was very important.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: And respect.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What always impresses
                        me in dealing with the Chinese is that your word counts.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Maybe the day
                        will come when your northern neighbor will wish it had settled the border
                        dispute during those two years.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Nobody can tell.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Joseph Alsop is going
                        to China and will seek an interview with the Prime Minister. If you could
                        pay some attention to him, it would be very useful.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Mr. Galbraith said what you told me he would say.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> I want to tell you that
                        I appreciate very much your seeing him.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: And we found he had very clear ideas on the
                        India-Pakistan crisis.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All wrong.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Really? At the time of the Security Council debate on
                        the entry of Bangladesh, I told Galbraith that we were not opposed to
                        Bangladesh. I said that we thought the people of Bangladesh were good and
                        that we had no prejudice against its leader, but the main thing was to
                        implement the UN resolutions. Galbraith said he was in complete agreement
                        with me, and wondered why Bangladesh was in such a hurry. He said that China
                        was outside the UN for 24 years—it was really 22 years - and that they also
                        should be able to wait 24 years.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He was very impressed
                        with his meeting with you. He called me when he got back. <pb n="14" xml:id="d166-14" facs="d166-14"/>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I was very much
                        impressed by his views. I thought he was reasoning things out, but you know
                        better. He is your old friend.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He is a very
                        intelligent and decent man, very influential among American intellectuals,
                        and I thought it was important that you see him. He had a very good
                        impression of the Vice Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We feel we can make friends with those who are
                        honest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister made
                        quite an impression on Foreign Secretary Home with respect to problems where
                        he needed to have an impression on him, including India-Pakistan and
                        Bangladesh.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We talked about the same questions, not only with Home,
                        but <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName>. We are realistic; we are
                        not windbags.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is rare among
                        Foreign Ministers these days. <pb n="15" xml:id="d166-15" facs="d166-15"/>In
                        this sense you had a very good influence on the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Tomorrow I leave for Britain, and I will probably have
                        a chance to see <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> Home.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: lam sure. If necessary,
                        I will talk with him about this some more.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In many European
                        countries—this is not true of Home—the left wing is influenced by Moscow. It
                        is very useful to hear from Peking a different assessment of international
                        affairs. Because you are very realistic and not windbags. This is very
                        helpful. I talked to <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName>, Scheel
                        and Home after you. I believe with. respect to Europe in this his torical
                        period our interests are practically identical.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Yes, indeed.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then got up to propose
                        a toast, which follows):</p>
                    <p>“This is a very informal occasion, but is also a very notable occasion
                        because I think it is the first opportunity that we in Washington have had
                        to entertain on a social occasion senior officials from the People's
                        Republic of China. When we look back on the last four years, the most
                        important event in a very dramatic four years has been the first visit to
                        China. It has brought an entirely new perspective to all of us.</p>
                    <p>“If I may say so, although you are a communist country we greatly respect
                        people who deal with events in terms of objective circumstances and we
                        recognize that you are people who have fought for your ideal in a way that
                        trivial people would not do. You are also people who very strongly defend
                        principle, and we can rely on your word. We deal with you in frankness,
                        openness and mutual trust. We have many shared objectives, some of which
                        were reflected in the Shanghai Communique, and some of which were as
                        discussed tonight at the dinner table. We both oppose hegemony. We both are
                        dedicated to the independence of nations. And we both are dedicated to the
                        principles discussed so much during the visit to China, and which appeared
                        in the Shanghai Communique.</p>
                    <p>“On our side, a week after the President's election, I assure you that the
                        normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China is not a
                        tactical development but a profound historical necessity which we will
                        pursue with greater vigor during the new Administration. We will do <pb n="16" xml:id="d166-16" facs="d166-16"/>this because we believe in it.
                        The principles of the Shanghai Communique will be embellished in the next
                        Administration, and we will make the transition in our relations from
                        adversaries to friendship—a friendship which already exists at the human
                        level between our peoples and our governments.</p>
                    <p>“I propose a toast to the Chinese and American people, to the Vice Foreign
                        Minister, and to an accelerated improvement in our relations.”</p>
                    <p>(Vice Minister Ch'iao then rose to make his own toast.)</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: In the past two years, in the improvement of relations
                        between China and the U.S. all people will remember one person without a
                        name—who is here tonight, “Mr. Doctor”—who has made outstanding
                        contributions. And we also hope that in the relations between our two
                        countries we will continue t o overcome various obstacles and difficulties
                        and head toward accelerated normalization.</p>
                    <p>At this time here I would like to express congratulations on the reelection
                        of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I think all agree—I agree with the views of our many friends and our friend
                        whose name I forgot. Therefore, I propose a toast to the man whose name I
                        forgot, to Mr. Governor, and to all our friends and the great people ;of our
                        two countries and our great friendship. (Sits down.)</p>
                    <p>At the banquet in Shanghai, the President said something that our northern
                        friend attacked us about.</p>
                    <p>It was just a sentence, and was nothing very serious in the first place. He
                        said that when the Chinese and American peoples were united, they would be
                        invincible in the world. They (the northern friends) said from this that
                        China and the U.S. were united against the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They said it to us,
                        too.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: They attacked
                        you because it is true.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the statement that
                        “this was the week that changed the world” they attacked us. We meant both
                        sentences. It changed the world and it is in our interest to stay together
                        with you.</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="d166-17" facs="d166-17"/>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: This sentence is correct in the first place.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Both are correct.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: It would indicate the changed situation in the world.
                        And if our two people unite, why not?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is not directed
                        against anyone but it is a peaceful intent.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I have told many friends that we are very patient in
                        our negotiations with our Soviet friends. Why should we oppose the Soviet
                        Union? It is not true. We are not opposed, although we are not in agreement
                        with their policy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is an amazing thing.
                        We make many agreements with the Soviet Union. We always tell you, but there
                        are no complaints. You are not opposed.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We are not that kind of people, with absolutely
                        subjective views. We know that different countries have different views and
                        different ways. of acting. We don't demand that all the people in the world
                        act as we do.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are very
                        self-confident.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Our self-confidence comes from the fact that we have no
                        expansionist intention nor any ulterior motive. We only defend our
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is important that we
                        both oppose expansionism by others.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We also oppose the hegemony of any country. We jointly
                        oppose the hegemony of any country. We related the same position to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> and Mr. Ohira. On the
                        question of Japan, I don't know what you feel. We told you our attitude.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="d166-18" facs="d166-18"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: First, we appreciate
                        the fair way you kept us informed about your moves. Second, we have no
                        objection to the normalization of relations between Japan and the People's
                        Republic. I think we have a common interest in not exciting Japan's
                        nationalistic ambitions too much, because even if at first it turns against
                        one of us, at the first change it could turn against the other.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: It was the same with Germany, the Nazis. Nazi Germany
                        first opposed one country and then the other.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So, if we can keep that
                        principle which we have established in mind, we think that Sino-Japanese
                        relations can be very useful.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We will firmly carry out this policy. The last time
                        Ohira was in the United States, he first talked to you, and then he talked
                        to me.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When be was in New York
                        City.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: In a reception I said that we very much hoped that
                        Japan would maintain friendly relations with all of her neighbors, with the
                        U.S. and the Soy-let Union and China and other countries.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Good.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The danger with Japan
                        is the one the Prime Minister mentioned to me at our last meeting. If it is
                        too full of pride in its achievements it might become very nationalistic.
                        But if countries like you and we encourage it in a moderate direction, we
                        can control that. We have noticed you have not discouraged them from
                        maintaining military relations with us, and you will notice we have not
                        discouraged them from maintaining economic and political relations with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We are very clear about this point and I think both of
                        us must make efforts, particularly you, to prevent Japan from embarking on
                        the old track of expansionism and aggression.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, you can be
                        sure.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="d166-19" facs="d166-19"/>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We talked with <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> and Ohira about this question, because the results of
                        embarking on the old road would be dangerous and not in the interest of
                        Japan itself.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We should keep
                        ourselves generally informed.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Mr. Doctor, you
                        have greater influence in Japan than China does, so you have greater
                        responsibility. I speak honestly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are right. But if
                        we compete with each other and encourage Japan then neither has any
                        influence. We will encourage Japan in a moderate direction and keep you
                        generally informed. I think it would be helpful if we kept each other
                        informed. Our interests are mutual.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Please rest assured that we will inform you of the
                        general spirit of what we talk about with Japan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have been very
                        correct.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Because a revival of Japanese militarism would not be
                        good for Japan, nor to the interests of China or yourself. Either they would
                        attack you or us and in the end be defeated.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: We draw profound lessons from history. We have less to
                        say than you, except in culture. Our attitude is more influential in
                        economic and political problems, the U.S. in military ones.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. On political and
                        military matters, the U.S. has more influence, but in the long range
                        cultural sense, you have more.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Correct. But that
                        is caused by history.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And by Japanese
                        greed.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: That is a problem.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: I suggest that
                        as an observation on Japan, that Japanese economic cooperation with China,
                        and Japanese economic cooperation with other countries should be balanced,
                        so that there is not a one-sided influence.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="d166-20" facs="d166-20"/>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I agree. We don't talk behind the backs of the
                        Japanese. We also tell the Japanese that. What Mr. Governor has said is
                        correct, but it is impossible for Japan to be excessively linked with China
                        economically unless China becomes a colony of Japan. I tell you in
                        confidence we will not repeat fifty years of history.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: I
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Some Japanese friends who are sober-minded also
                        understand this. Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>
                        That's good. Vice Minister Ch'iao: Another subject I would like to talk
                        about is Vietnam. You understand our position. We will not get involved in
                        this question, but we earnestly hope that you will settle it in a very good
                        way. We have our own positions and many questions, but today we will not
                        debate. We can talk about it in Peking.</p>
                    <p>Indeed this is a very important question. If the Vietnam question cannot be
                        solved, then the Indochina question cannot be solved, and this will be a
                        very difficult problem in the relations between our two countries. This is
                        the overall significance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. I hope when I
                        am in Peking we will have a signed agreement. I will not ask you to give me
                        a reply, but when Le Duc Tho comes to Paris be will undoubtedly stop in
                        Peking. The great thing about the Prime Minister's conversations with me and
                        the President was that be could distinguish between what is essential from
                        the trivial, and he remained objective. The North Vietnamese have one
                        difficulty—they are a small country and they do not have your largeness of
                        spirit—they cant keep the larger view and not get bogged down in detail. If
                        be comes to Paris with this largeness of spirit, I am certain we can reach a
                        fair solution. If there is a period of quiet so normal forces can begin to
                        assert themselves, then I believe that Indochina will disappear as an issue
                        between our two countries. This is our highest objective.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="d166-21" facs="d166-21"/>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I am going to tell you my personal opinion. You said
                        that the Vietnamese side and the American side have made many mistakes. You
                        know and we know that we are not in agreement with you on those questions. I
                        will not debate it here. But recently Saigon has made many, many statements
                        and has put forward positions which make the whole situation insoluble.
                        That's what I'm worried about. That is my personal opinion. I think that
                        after over more than one year of contact between us we have identical
                        positions on many questions. Anyway, we must think of a way out.</p>
                    <p>I think you still remember before when you were embarking on the plane, Prime
                        Minister Cbou En-Lai said to the President that Vietnam is a small country
                        and the U.S. should assume a high profile.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understood the Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: A high vantage point. I think a country like yours can
                        make some concessions. Maybe you can't accept this. I speak what I think. I
                        don't want to humiliate you. I have no intention.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no, we are speaking
                        as friends.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: For example, the question of the presence of North
                        Vietnamese troops in the South. If you make too big an issue of it, Hanoi
                        cannot possibly accept, and your views will fundamentally be untenable. I
                        think Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> En-Lal
                        stated to you that we indeed understand the feeling of the Vietnamese
                        people, and you should show some statesmanship to such a fighting and
                        courageous small country. For example, you talk about the propaganda from
                        Hanoi. You should not blame them on this and take what they say to heart.
                        Anyway, we should think of a way out of this question, though it is a small
                        question, if it is not solved, then others cannot be solved.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. First we must
                        make an effort to find a way out. We are looking at this in a statesmanlike
                        way, and we are not supporting all of Saigon's points. On the other band, we
                        cannot totally ignore a country in which we have fought and where we are
                        still fighting. It is not unreasonable that they make requests. We are
                        willing to be generous, but we will not back all their demands. We can see
                        from the radio that they are not satisfied. Nobody can respect us if we
                        overthrow a country we have supported. If people see us as being totally
                        cynical, then in other <pb n="22" xml:id="d166-22" facs="d166-22"/>difficult
                        situations there is a problem. We will not make an excessive issue of the
                        North Vietnamese troops. They must make some concession, but we do not ask
                        them to make all. They do not have to make all the concessions; we will make
                        some too and approach them half way, but they must do something. Your
                        influence could be very helpful. I know you have your principles, as we have
                        ours. I have experienced yours, usually after midnight (laughter).</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Mr. “X” (laughter), I am not Le Duc Tho. I do not
                        represent Le Duc Tho. It would be a good thing to settle this question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My own estimate is that
                        by the time I come to Peking, if Hanoi shows any reasonableness, this will
                        be settled.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I won't discuss this with you. I will only say one
                        word. I studied philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So did I.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: So we're in the same line. One should not lose the
                        whole world just to gain South Vietnam. Perhaps the Governor will not agree
                        with me, but you're too much involved in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: I don't think we
                        will lose the whole world.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: There are many causes. I talked philosophy with you
                        last year. The results of the India-Pakistan question were that you were too
                        much involved. You may not agree,, and treat me as a professor treats a
                        student.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree that there is
                        something in what you say, but if we are humiliated in Indochina we will not
                        be able to do anything anywhere else. The Governor is more experienced than
                        I am, and knows this.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Just as a
                        politician.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: You are modest.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="d166-23" facs="d166-23"/>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: As an observer
                        rather than a politician, we have been through a period of politics for
                        North Vietnam, South Vietnam and the U.S., partly having to do with the
                        elections. Now we can say that the time has come to get together and
                        settle.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister <persName corresp="#p_QG1">Chiao</persName>: Because now you
                        are in the position to settle the question.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>: Now we are in a
                        position to settle.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: That is not to say that we hope that somebody is
                        humiliated. Nobody should be humiliated.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On that basis we can
                        certainly settle within a month. My honest judgment is that it is 80 - 85
                        percent settled, and it would be a great tragedy if the remaining
                        differences were to stop an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I'm a little worried about the question of North
                        Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam. If you act like the propaganda in Saigon
                        it will be difficult.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will tell you
                        informally that we will not go nearly so far as the propaganda in Saigon,
                        but Hanoi must cooperate and give us something. Then we can go to Saigon and
                        say this is all we can get. But if Hanoi does nothing then there is a
                        problem. I can assure you that we will not go nearly so far as Saigon.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: I told you now that I am not Le Duc Tho.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We need a face-saving
                        formula. You know how much importance we Westerners attach to face.</p>
                    <p>Vice Minister Ch'iao: Just like Orientals! You have talked with us one year
                        and more, and you know that the Chinese are frank and honest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and they always
                        keep their word.</p>
                    <p>(The Chinese soon took their leave in a most cordial fashion.)</p>

                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on October 31, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Chinese Mission at 3:30 p.m., was greeted by Mrs. Shih, and
                        escorted to the second floor. Tea was served and pleasantries exchanged.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih presented the note (attached) and asked that it be forwarded to Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I read the note and
                        had no questions. Mrs. Shih then said she had an oral message to pass to Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>“The Vice Foreign Minister and the Ambassador appreciate Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> kind invitation to dinner.
                        However, they are sorry that they cannot accept it. Since the invitation
                        came on short notice, the Vice Foreign Minister had made other plans.
                        Perhaps we can discuss another date later.”</p>
                    <p>After making this presentation, Mrs. Shih immediately turned the conversation
                        to general amenities.</p>
                    <p>I departed the Mission at 3:55 p.m. and telephoned <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Winston Lord</persName> with a gist of the note and the oral

                    <p>The following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission
                        in New York on October 16, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Mission at 2:30 p.m. and was greeted by Mrs. Shih and escorted
                        to the second floor. Tea was served and pleasantries exchanged.</p>
                    <p>I handed the message (attached) to Mrs. Shih and told her Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that it be conveyed to the

                        no questions.</p>
                    <p>In the general conversation that followed, Mrs. Shih made the following
                        comments:</p>
                    <p>— She was pleased to see the President had received the Chinese medical
                        delegation.</p>
                    <p>— She commented on the photos in Life magazine of Chinese Mission personnel.
                        (This was done in a light vein.)</p>
                    <p>— I noticed workmen in the area and Mrs. Shih said they were installing a
                        closed-circuit TV.</p>
                    <p>— I departed the Mission at 3:10 p.m. with Mrs. Shih's greetings to all.</p>

                        Asia. One of the remaining issues in the effort to achieve a negotiated
                        settlement of the conflict relates to the question of restricting military
                        supplies to both North and South Vietnam by outside powers. The Democratic
                        Republic of Vietnam has insisted that there can be no international
                        restrictions on the amount of military aid it will receive from outside
                        powers while on the other hand there must be precisely such restrictions
                        with regard to aid for South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>While the U.S. side is prepared to accept limitations on American military
                        aid to South Vietnam under the terms of the settlement, such a one-sided
                        limitation will not be understood by the American public, on whose support
                        the viability of any arrangements depends. Moreover, such a one-sided
                        arrangement would violate the principle of reciprocity and equality of
                        commitments which must be the foundation of any lasting settlement.</p>
                    <p>The question of how restrictions on military aid to North Vietnam may be
                        formulated in the actual agreement on the settlement is less important than
                        the actual conduct, in practice, of the countries which are the principal
                        military suppliers of the North Vietnamese. Therefore, in assessing its
                        willingness to undertake what are essentially unilateral <pb n="3" xml:id="d168-03" facs="d168-03"/>written obligations on this outstanding
                        point, the U.S. side would welcome some indication from the Government of
                        the People's Republic of China as to what policies it will pursue in regard
                        to United States and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>As soon as a settlement is arrived at, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will be prepared to explore other outstanding
                        issues of Indochina, especially the problem of Cambodia.</p>

                        greeted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> warmly. He took
                        the American party into the living room. There was some small talk,
                        including Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>'s and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s mutual pleasure at
                        seeing one another again.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: You are busy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am caught between two
                        groups of Vietnamese fighting each other. It is a terrible fate.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: The Chinese have a
                        saying, “galloping all the time on horseback.” (laughter)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That was recently
                        translated into Italian.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d169-02" facs="d169-02"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Seeing you reminds me
                        of my old friend, General Walters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He is now in
                        Washington. I see him often.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I also remember my
                        old colleague, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName>. lam
                        glad to hear that he and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName>
                        will be in Paris November 27.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> is coming then and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> later.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I think when Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> comes he will ask to go to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: His daughter wishes to
                        go to China as well.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: And a friend of
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Miss Watson</persName>'s also.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think the Ambassador
                        has learned English. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>
                        indicates he has picked up some.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> is an old friend, and the Chinese
                        People's Institute will invite them. If <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Miss
                            Watson</persName> and her friend travel with Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName>, they will be the guests of the
                        Chinese People's Institute. If Miss <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> and her friend go alone, the trip will be arranged by
                        the travel agency.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was thinking again on
                        going to China, as you probably know. I am serious—I am thinking of going in
                        early January.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: You are welcome
                        whenever you wish to go to China.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I look forward to it
                        very much, but I must lose weight first because I know I gain whenever I go
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: How much did you gain
                        last time when I was there to welcome you?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Four or five
                        pounds.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d169-03" facs="d169-03"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: (In French) Pas
                        beaucoup.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That was because I only
                        had five meals a day.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I am sorry I couldn't
                        see you from 7:00 to 8:00 tonight. I held a reception for the medical
                        delegation which just visited your country.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I saw them at the White
                        House, and the President saw them. I had an opportunity to shake their
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Our medical
                        delegation told me a lot of things about their visit to the U.S. They are
                        very much satisfied to be received by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and some other friends. They also told me that they
                        saw Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. We are satisfied
                        that the Chinese delegations, including the medical delegation, were warmly
                        received by the American Government. A few days ago our acrobatic team
                        arrived in Canada and will go on later to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They will come to
                        America in December, around December 15.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: We have encouraged
                        them to put on a performance to display their best technique to the American
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I look forward to
                        seeing them. I visited the Institute where they were training when we were
                        in Peking in June.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: This time you will
                        have an opportunity to see if their technique has improved.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I look forward to
                        seeing them. [To <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>]: Are they
                        coming to Washington?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: They will be at the
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> Center in January.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Now we are discussing
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName> the exposition of
                        unearthed relics.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d169-04" facs="d169-04"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That includes the jade
                        costumes from the Imperial City.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: There is something
                        better than that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Your collection is
                        going to New York.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: First it is coming to
                        Paris, and then it will go to other countries and after that it will go to
                        the U.S.</p>
                    <p>I have learned that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        and you are very much concerned with the Paris channel between our two
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. We have a very
                        great interest in it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: We are very satisfied
                        to see the progress between our two sides through this channel, and we hope
                        that the channel will see further progress in the future.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We hope to see the
                        Ambassador in America sometime soon. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> smiles.) We consider relations with the Peoples
                        Republic as one of the most important aspects of our foreign policy. As I
                        told your Vice Foreign Minister, what we started in the previous
                        Administration we will accelerate now that the President is reelected, and
                        we expect to take large steps toward normalization of our relations. (Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> repeats the substance
                        when Mr. Ling has trouble understanding.) It is our firm intention.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Yes, I read the
                        speech delivered by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Ambassador
                            <persName>Malik</persName> was very happy when your Vice Minister left
                        New York (laughter). The Minister always torments him.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: He appeared to be
                        quite fierce last year.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I have learned that
                        this year he is not as fierce as last year.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He has been
                        intimidated.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Why? They have so
                        many atom bombs and so many troops. They have more than one million troops
                        along the Chinese border. They are quite strong. Why be afraid?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They are very
                        nervous.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. Tsao starts to leave the room and is called back by the Ambassador.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: It is too late to
                        invite you to eat some Chinese food. The Chinese custom is to entertain our
                        guests in any event with some Chinese food. This will be more simple than a
                        meal. (Mr. Tsao leaves.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am sorry that I could
                        not accept your very nice invitation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I know you didn't
                        have time. I hope sometime in the future you can do so.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would be honored. I
                        am told by the Minister [Kubisch] you serve the best Chinese food in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: One of the menus for
                        the meals during President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                        visit to China was published here in Paris and gave a great boon to Chinese
                        restaurants in Paris. So we intended to try our best to make the dishes
                        according to the menu for the President. Many of our friends who come to our
                        embassy to have a Chinese dinner have never been to China, and since they
                        don't know the dishes in China they say we have the best food in Paris.
                        Actually it is not so good as Peking. The other day Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName> also said that our dishes were
                        good. If Mr. Kubi.sch went to China he would say they were not so good
                        here.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="d169-06" facs="d169-06"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName>: It is hard to believe
                        that it would be better in Peking than here in your embassy, Mr. Ambassador.
                        It is so delicious.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> must know very well that the food
                        in Peking is better than the food here.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have never had a meal
                        here, but I know the food in Peking is outstanding.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I hope to entertain
                        you in the future.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I hope there will not
                        be too many more trips to Paris on this particular enterprise on which I am
                        engaged, though I am always delighted to see the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I am also very glad
                        to see Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. How many days
                        longer will Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stay in
                        Paris?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will decide tomorrow.
                        I will decide tomorrow whether we can finish quickly or whether I should
                        have to come back. When we have made a decision I will let the Minister call
                        you just for your information. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> nods).</p>
                    <p>(Warm snacks, including spring rolls, were then brought in, adding to the tea
                        already there.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: According to the
                        broadcast today, we learned that today you and the Vietnamese side once
                        again held talks.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, I had a private
                        talk today with Le Duc Tho, with only my Deputy, General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>, and myself present. On the
                        Vietnamese side were Le Duc Tho and <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan
                            Thuy</persName>. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>
                        then led the party in a round of gombays with mao tai.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I learned that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s daughter would like
                        to go to China.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: She would like to go
                        next spring.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="d169-07" facs="d169-07"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: If she would like to
                        go, it is better to go in the spring.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is her intent. I
                        was going to talk to your Ambassador in New York about it.</p>
                    <p>We are very pleased the way this channel is working and very pleased at the
                        efforts you are making. You and I established it. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> smiles.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I should say that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAK1">Watson</persName> and I cooperated very
                        well. Although our cooperation did not last very long, we cooperated very
                        well. Of course, I am cooperating very well with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName> now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is he behaving
                        himself?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: He is a very good
                        collaborator.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If he gives you any
                        trouble, let me know.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: At one time Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName> was in the Navy and I was
                        an Army man once, and thus we are colleagues.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe we will see a
                        General as Ambassador here after January 1.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: That would be fine.
                        In that case your Ambassador and I would be at the same time colleagues and
                        Generals.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You would be planning
                        military campaigns all the time.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Frankness is one of
                        the characteristics of Generals, of army men, so we can exchange views very
                        frankly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely. (not
                        translated) We want this channel to develop more and more.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: We hope the same.
                        Gombay! (The party then drinks more mao tai.)</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="d169-08" facs="d169-08"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If they have to carry
                        me and the Minister into the Embassy, I won't tell them where we have been.
                        (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: In that case it will
                        be spread in the papers tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That would be quite
                        serious. In Washington they are happy with anything I do as long as I am not
                        photographed with a girl. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> laughs.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: A few days ago I saw
                        a picture of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> together
                        with the wife of a friend. The introduction to the article made this
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's living very
                        dangerously. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>
                        laughs.) He [the husband] made the reservations for us at lunch.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: These are the small
                        hours, and we are still keeping you up. Will you go on with your talks
                        tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we will go on
                        tomorrow. I have another private meeting with Le Duc Tho in the morning, and
                        after that we will decide whether to continue or to interrupt for a few
                        days.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: What do you think the
                        prospects are for this round of talks? (Mr. Tsao takes out his notebook and
                        begins taking notes.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We've settled many
                        problems. I want to be honest with you. We would like to make peace. We have
                        nothing to win in Vietnam. If we can normalize our relations with Peking, we
                        can normalize our relations with Hanoi. And I think our interests—that is,
                        the interests of Peking and Washington—are not too different. At least we
                        want only a neutral, independent Indochina. We don't want any foreign powers
                        that are far away establishing a military position there. But we also have
                        our principles, and we cannot make an agreement when our allies feel that we
                        are sacrificing all their concerns.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="d169-09" facs="d169-09"/>
                    <p>There is one principal problem, which is the presence of so many North
                        Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam. They tell us that these are not North
                        Vietnamese troops, and for reasons of their principles, we are willing to
                        maintain what we know is a fiction. But if the North Vietnamese, outside of
                        the agreement, would withdraw some troops, or would make some gesture that
                        indicated they understood the problem which would enable us to preserve the
                        principle, we think we could settle quite rapidly.</p>
                    <p>And it is difficult to imagine that having come this close to an agreement,
                        we should fail now. But if we cannot get an agreement, we must prosecute the
                        war. And I tell you, really in friendship, given the dangers I foresee in
                        the world outside Vietnam it cannot be in the interests of some of our
                        friends to pressure us to give up our principles, because we will be in many
                        difficult situations where we will have to make difficult decisions when
                        greater powers are involved. (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> repeats the substance when Mr. Ling has trouble
                        understanding.) In Vietnam this is the issue. We want to settle. But if the
                        American people are told that the U.S. will do anything to have peace, then
                        if some great power with aggressive tendencies engages in aggression, it
                        will be very difficult to appeal to our people to resist them as we in the
                        White House believe we should resist them.</p>
                    <p>So, we want to make a genuine peace, but we must have some recognition that
                        we too have the respect of our allies to consider. That is the principal
                        issue right now.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Because we are
                        friends, I would like to use this opportunity to say some sincere words
                        about the Vietnam problem to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is surely aware of the Chinese position on the
                        Vietnam problem. (During this presentation, Mr. Ling is clearly reading from
                        a prepared English text, as he takes very few notes on what the Ambassador
                        is saying, merely seeming to correct a few words on his notebook as the
                        Ambassador speaks.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. (not
                        translated)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: I should very frankly
                        say that we very much regret that you did not sign the agreement which was
                        scheduled in October.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="d169-10" facs="d169-10"/>
                    <p>Now it seems very clear that you acted that way in order to suit your own
                        unilateral needs. During recent days, according to what we have gotten to
                        know, the Vietnamese side has been carrying on the talks with great
                        flexibility. Considering the situation as a whole, they have made all the
                        concessions which they can make. Now everything is up to your side. If once
                        again you fail to reach an agreement with them, how can you achieve trust in
                        others? Besides such a result will only benefit someone who is contending
                        for hegemony. I would like to repeat again that since we are friends that is
                        all I want to say sincerely about the Vietnam problem to you.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. I
                        appreciate it. But let me as a friend speak equally sincerely to you. You
                        have your own experience with us. You know we have kept every promise we
                        have made to you, and we always believe that reliability is a very important
                        principle. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> confers
                        with his colleagues and Mr. Kubisch repeats the word “reliability.”)</p>
                    <p>But what did we face with the Vietnamese? For four years I was negotiating
                        with them and there was never any change in their position. They always said
                        exactly the same thing for four years. Suddenly on October 8 they wanted to
                        settle a war that has lasted ten years in three days. In order to show our
                        good will, we cooperated with a procedure which was, to put it mildly, very
                        extraordinary. We always told them that we had to consult our allies.
                        Despite our best efforts, we did not succeed in October. If we had wanted to
                        trap them, if we had wanted to delay the agreement, we could have delayed by
                        arguing about specific provisions indefinitely. But we cooperated with them,
                        and they are now trying to pressure us with this. Now they are giving us
                        deadlines again. They first make an unreasonable demand, then they withdraw
                        it and claim they have made a concession. And they want to trade giving up
                        unreasonable demands for real concessions on our side. That is the
                        difficulty.</p>
                    <p>When we dealt with you, we did so on an open basis. You never tried to take
                        advantage of us, and I hope we never tried to take advantage of you. If they
                        ever talk to us the way you do, we will settle in one day. It would be very
                        easy.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="d169-11" facs="d169-11"/>
                    <p>But again this week they have changed some wording in paragraphs that have no
                        concrete significance. For example, to give one example, there is a
                        paragraph concerning the ceasefire going into effect which specifies
                        Indochina time. Now it turns out that there is a Saigon time and a Hanoi
                        time. Now we have agreed to use <gloss target="#t_GMT1">GMT</gloss>. You
                        have to admit, speaking here privately, that this is not a big concession.
                        It is nothing about which history will be written some day. (Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> smiles. Or maybe I am
                        missing the significance.</p>
                    <p>And we clarified a few other sentences, so that esthetically it is a better
                        document now. (Mr. Ling does not understand “esthetically. ) It reads better
                        for experts who have studied grammar.</p>
                    <p>So this is the problem. I still think we can settle. But you see another
                        problem is that there are hundreds of American journalists in town, all of
                        whom talk to the North Vietnamese and all of whom happen to dislike the
                        President. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> smiles.)
                        Despite their dislike, the President got elected by 61 percent of the vote.
                        The Vietnamese must not listen to the journalists. They have listened for
                        too long. The President always means what he says. His word counts. We can
                        have peace this month—what is it now?—we can have peace in December. But
                        there has to be an effort on both sides. But we have narrowed the
                        differences this week. It's not true that it depends only on us.</p>
                    <p>I am sorry I have made such a long speech.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: This is our view,
                        that everything depends on your side.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't completely
                        agree.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Of course, we know
                        that you will not agree completely, but I tell you this as friends.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate the spirit
                        in which you say this, and I hope that when I visit China in January, when
                        the Prime Minister and I meet, we will not have to talk about Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="d169-12" facs="d169-12"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: (In English): Very
                        good!</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister said
                        something to the press. I have already complained to the Vice Minister about
                        it. When an American newspaperman asked him a question, he said he has to
                        give a direct answer. The only man who talks a half hour without saying
                        anything is Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, he said.
                        He was right, but I had kept that from the press. (The Chinese side appeared
                        to misinterpret the tone, thinking Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was displeased by the Prime Ministers
                        comments.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: We wonder if the
                        journalists added anything to what Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> Enlai said.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It was a joke. He meant
                        it as a joke.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: It has happened
                        several times that some journalists going from here have twisted what the
                        Prime Minister said here. (Mr. Tsao helps with the translation.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I took it as a
                        compliment. He said it with affection. It was not said as criticism.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: The peaceful solution
                        of Vietnam is the burning issue at this moment. I hope when you visit the
                        Prime Minister next year, it will not be necessary to talk about Vietnam
                        again.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree completely.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: It is the common
                        desire of the people all over the world, including the American people, the
                        Vietnamese people, and the Chinese people, that the Vietnam war come to an
                        end.</p>
                    <p>I took part in the current general conference of <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>, as head of the Chinese delegation. During the
                        conference I met your head of the delegation to the conference. (Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asks Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName> who that was, and the latter
                        mentioned that it was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Cultural
                        Affairs, together with the Ambassador.)</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="d169-13" facs="d169-13"/>
                    <p>I congratulated the President for his reelection through the head of your
                        delegation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName>: Please once again
                        convey my greetings to Mr. President.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I will do so with the
                        greatest pleasure, and if you could convey my greetings to the Prime
                        Minister and how much I look forward to seeing him again.</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then gets up to leave.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HZ2">Huang</persName> escorts the American
                        party to the door in a very cordial atmosphere. Mr. Tsao mentions to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> that “you have been very
                        busy.” The Chinese party stands on the steps outside the Embassy and waves
                        as the American party drives away.)</p>

                    <p>BEGIN TEXT: THE U.S. SIDE WISHES TO INFORM THE CHINESE SIDE THAT IT REMAINS
                        PREPARED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT ON VIETNAM WHICH WOULD MEET THE ASPIRATIONS OF
                        THE WORLD'S PEOPLES. TO THIS END, IT HAS SENT A MESSAGE TO THE <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> SIDE, THE TEXT OF WHICH IS ATTACHED.</p>
                    <p>THE U.S. SIDE WISHES TO POINT OUT THAT REPETITION OF UNJUST CHARGES CAN ONLY
                        COMPLICATE THE SITUATION. AN ANALYSIS OF THE U.S. MESSAGE CAN LEAVE NO DOUBT
                        THAT ITS PROPOSALS DO NOT CONSTITUTE SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS BUT RATHER THE
                        MINIMUM CLARIFICATIONS REQUIRED. THESE POSITIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACCEPTED
                        BY THE DRV SIDE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE DMZ
                        QUESTION, THE DRV SIDE AGREED TO LANGUAGE ON NOVEMBER 23, 1972, WHICH IS
                        ACCEPTABLE TO THE U.S. WITH RESPECT TO THE SIGNING PROCEDURE, THE DRV SIDE'S
                        OWN PROPOSAL, AS DESCRIBED IN THE U.S. MESSAGE, WOULD PROVIDE AN ACCEPTABLE
                        SOLUTION.</p>
                    <p>ON THE BASIS OF THE U.S. MESSAGE, THERE CAN BE A RAPID CONCLUSION OF THE
                        NEGOTIATIONS AND RESTORATION OF PEACE. END TEXT.</p>

                    <p>AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE RECORD OF THE RECENT NEGOTIATING SESSIONS, THE
                        U.S. SIDE HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DRV SIDE WAS DELIBERATELY AND
                        FRIVOLOUSLY DELAYING THE TALKS. THE U.S. SIDE WAS DETERMINED TO CONCLUDE THE
                        NEGOTIATIONS RAPIDLY AND THIS CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IF
                        THERE WERE RECIPROCAL GOOD WILL AND SERIOUS INTENT.</p>
                    <p>IN ORDER TO BRING THE NEGOTIATIONS TO A RAPID CONCLUSION, THE U.S. SIDE MAKES
                        THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL. WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AGREEMENT, THE
                        TWO SIDES SHOULD RETURN TO THE TEXT AS IT EXISTED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE
                        SESSION OF NOVEMBER 23, 1972, EXCEPT FOR THE DELETION OF THE PHRASE
                        “ADMINISTRATLVE STRUCTURE” IN ARTICLE 12(A) AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THE
                        STRICTLY TECHNICAL CHANGES IN THE TEXT MUTUALLY AGREED IN THE EXPERTS
                        MEETINGS IN DECEMBER. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROCEDURE FOR SIGNATURE, THIS
                        SHOULD BE ON THE BASIS OF THE DRV PROPOSAL OF MONDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1972.
                        ACCORDINGLY, THE UNITED STATES AND THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM SHOULD
                        JOINTLY SIGN THE AGREEMENT, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM
                        AND THE PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH
                        VIETNAM SHOULD SIGN SEPARATE DOCUMENTS WHICH WOULD BE IDENTICAL TO THE
                        AGREEMENT, MINUS THE PREAMBLE, AND THUS CONTAIN ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS.</p>
                    <p>IN THE MEANTIME THERE SHOULD BE RAPID PROGRESS ON THE PROTOCOLS DESIGNED TO
                        IMPLEMENT THE AGREEMENT. THE U.S. SIDE WISHES TO REEMPHASIZE THAT IT IS
                        UNACCEPTABLE TO REINTRODUCE INTO THESE PROTOCOLS SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES WHICH
                        CONFLICT WITH THE AGREEMENT ITSELF OR ATTEMPT TO REOPEN QUESTIONS ALREADY
                        DECIDED.</p>
                    <p>ON THIS BASIS, DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> IS
                        PREPARED TO MEET SPECIAL ADVISOR Le Duc Tho ON ANY DATE AFTER DECEMBER 26,
                        1972, TO BE CHOSEN BY THE DRV SIDE. IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE OF
                        HIS OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> TO REMAIN IN PARIS FOR EXTENDED
                        PERIODS OF TIME IN THE FUTURE. THE U.S. SIDE ALSO WANTS TO EMPHASIZE THAT
                        THE PRESENT FRAMEWORK FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT CANNOT BE MAINTAINED
                        INDEFINITELY.</p>
                    <p>THE U.S. SIDE REITERATES ITS STRONG PREFERENCE FOR AN EARLY AND STABLE PEACE
                        AND BELIEVES THAT A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THIS MESSAGE WOULD CONSTITUTE A
                        MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH TOWARD THAT GOAL.</p>

                    <p>Message Delivered to North Vietnamese December 22, 1972</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side wants to take the occasion of Vice Minister Thach's remarks at
                        the December 20 experts meeting to state the following:</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Side's references to the past record
                        concerning U.S. military actions contain distortions based on quotations
                        taken out of context, a practice that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side has resorted to with increasing frequency at recent
                        meetings. As the DRV side well knows, the U.S. side unilaterally accepted
                        some restrictions on its military actions so long as an agreement seemed
                        imminent and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side was negotiating in
                        good faith. The U.S. side has repeatedly emphasized that these restrictions
                        would be impossible to maintain if the negotiations no longer reflected a
                        serious attitude by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side. As its
                        message of December 18, 1972 made clear, the U.S. side came to the
                        conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> side was
                        deliberately and frivolously delaying the talks during the session of
                        December 4-13.</p>
                    <p>Both governments now confront a very grave decision. The choice is whether to
                        slide into a continuation of the conflict or to make a serious final effort
                        to reach a settlement at a time when agreement is so near. The U.S. side,
                        preferring the latter course, proposes a meeting between Special Adviser Le
                        Duc Tho and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> January 3,
                        1973 in Paris on the basis of the U.S. message of December 18, 1972. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> could set aside three
                        days for the purpose of concluding the settlement.</p>
                    <p>If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> agrees to this meeting, the U.S.,
                        as a sign of its good will, will again suspend its bombing north of the 20th
                        parallel starting as of midnight December 31 and lasting for the duration of
                        the negotiating sessions. If an agreement is reached, this restriction will
                        continue. The U.S. side reaffirms that it will stop all bombing and shelling
                        against the territory of Democratic Republic of Vietnam within 48 hours of
                        an agreement in Paris.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime the technical experts should at last start serious
                        negotiations on the protocols associated with the agreement with a view to
                        reaching agreement on these documents in time for a settlement during the
                        meeting between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        Special Adviser Le Duc Tho.</p>

                    <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</p>
                    <p>Following is a report of a meeting with Mrs. Shih at the Chinese Mission in
                        New York on December 22, 1972.</p>
                    <p>I entered the Mission at 3:45 p.m., was greeted by Mrs. Shih and escorted to
                        the second floor. Tea was served and pleasantries exchanged.</p>
                    <p>I presented the package to Mrs. Shih and explained that although Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had intended to send
                        two sets of the minutes, after reviewing the texts, he found that one was a
                        repetition of the other. Therefore, she would receive only the December 13,
                        1972 transcript.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Shih acknowledged that they were expecting two sets; however, she
                        accepted the explanation. Mrs. Shih did not read the document, but counted
                        the pages to make sure that it was complete.</p>
                    <p>I departed the Mission at 4:15 p.m.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>December 29, 1972</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side has read the message of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                        side of December 28, 1972. The U.S. accepts the following propositions:</p>
                    <p>1. Experts of the two sides will resume meetings on January 2, 1973.</p>
                    <p>2. A private meeting of Special Adviser Le Duc Tho and Minister <persName corresp="#p_XTC1">Xuan Thuy</persName> with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will take place on January 8,
                        1973 in Paris.</p>
                    <p>U.S. liaison officers will be in touch with their North Vietnamese
                        counterparts regarding specific arrangements for the meetings of experts as
                        well as arrangements for alternating the meeting sites for the private
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>As indicated in its messages of December 22 and 27, 1972, the U.S. side will
                        as a unilateral gesture cease the bombing of North Vietnam north of the 20th
                        parallel by 7:00 p.m. Washington time on December 29, 1972.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side wants to again affirm that it will make one final major effort
                        to see whether a settlement within the October framework can be worked out.
                        The U.S. side wants to point out that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will not be able to spend more than four days in
                        Paris on this occasion. A repetition of the procedures followed in December
                        could lead to a collapse of the talks.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side enters these renewed negotiations with good will but urges the
                        DRV side to study carefully the U.S. message of December 18, 1972. The
                        decision must be made now whether it is possible to move from a period of
                        hostility to one of normalization. This remains the U.S. goal which will be
                        pursued with great seriousness.</p>
                    <p>In the interim it is essential that both sides show the maximum restraint in
                        their public pronouncements.</p>
