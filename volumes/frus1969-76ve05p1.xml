                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume E–5, Documents on Africa, 1969–1972</ref>, as an electronic-only publication. This volume is the latest publication in the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important decisions and actions of the foreign policy of the administrations of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald Ford</persName>. Volume E–5 is the third <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in this new format, available to all free of charge on the Internet. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes scheduled for publication for the 1969–1976 subseries, covering the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations, will be in this format.</p>
                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration toward Sub-Saharan Africa, 1969–1972, with the exception of Southern Africa, which will be covered in a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> print volume to be published later. The largest chapter in this volume deals with the challenges faced by the Department of State and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration during and after the Nigerian civil war. The principal issue was how to channel humanitarian aid to Biafrans, without undermining the U.S. policy of non-intervention in the civil war. Included in this chapter are documents that illuminate President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>ʼs personal views on the humanitarian crisis there. The second largest chapter is on the Horn of Africa and U.S. relations with Ethiopia and the Somali Republic. The United States became increasingly identified with Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs Government and U.S. relations with the pro-Soviet Union Somali Republic deteriorated markedly. The chapter on Burundi highlights another humanitarian crisis: the large-scale massacres of civilians condoned by the Burundi Government in late 1972. The Department of State and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration were slow to realize the nature of this tragedy. Given a policy of non-intervention, and the fact that the massacres were drawing to a close when the tragic nature of the events were brought to its attention, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration decided that realistically there was little that it could do to ameliorate the situation. The downward spiral of U.S. relations with Uganda and its erratic President, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName>, is covered in a separate chapter. Zaire and its President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, who was then considered by Washington a staunch friend in a key central African country and a relative success story in Africa, has its own chapter. U.S. relations and policy toward other sub-Saharan African countries not mentioned above, if significant, are covered in the first chapter on general African policy.</p>
                <p>The volume, including a preface, list of names, abbreviations, sources, annotated document list, and this press release, is available on the Office of the Historian website (<ref target="frus1969-76ve05p1">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/e5</ref>).

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">George H. W. Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of Stateʼs Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the</hi> Foreign Relations <hi rend="italic">Series</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important decisions and actions of the foreign policy of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>. This is the third <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in a new format, that of electronic-only publication. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes scheduled for publication for the 1969–1976 subseries, covering the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations, will be in this format. The decision to institute this change was taken in full consultation with the Departmentʼs Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established under the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute. The advantages of this new method of presenting documentation are evident in this volume: the format enables convenient access to more key documentation on a broader range of issues, all or any portion of which can be easily downloaded. Annotation—the value added element of documentary editing—is still present in limited form, but not to the scale of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume. This electronic-only publication results in substantial savings in cost and time of production, thus allowing the series to present a fuller range of documentation, on a wider range of topics, sooner than would have been possible under a print-only format. These advantages compensate for the fact that this <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an actual book bound in traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the Historian, the General Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all dedicated to publishing the great majority of the volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also posted in electronic format on the Department of Stateʼs website. While the future of research in documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease of use and availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue to use both print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In that sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the series begun by President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued by subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for more than 140 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for <ref target="frus1969-76ve05p1">Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, E–5</ref>
                    </hi>
                </p>
                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration toward sub-Saharan Africa with the exceptions of the Republic of South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, and Namibia, which are covered in print volume <ref target="frus1969-76v28">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> 1969–1976, Vol. XXVIII, Southern Africa, 1969–1976</ref>. In addition, chapters on U.S. policy toward North Africa will be included in this electronic-only volume when they are declassified. This volume does not attempt to cover all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but instead concentrates on those areas where U.S. interests and concerns were greatest. The chapter on general U.S. policy toward Africa provides the widest scope of coverage.</p>
                <p>The largest chapter, comprising more than half the volume, documents the Nigeria civil war and it aftermath. While the United States did not recognize the rebellion in Biafra and followed a policy of non-intervention, it was heavily involved in providing humanitarian relief mainly through the International Committee of the Red Cross and Joint Church Aid. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> appointed A Special Coordinator on Relief to Civilian Victims of the Nigerian Civil War to provide guidance and direction to relief operations and to deflect some of the domestic criticism of the U.S. policy of non-intervention. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> himself was sympathetic to Biafran aspirations and the suffering caused by the civil war, and complained about, but did not to change, the Department of State policy of refusing to recognize Biafra as a belligerent.</p>
                <p>The second great humanitarian crisis covered by the volume relates to the 1972 massacres of Hutus by Tutsis in Burundi. Again the Department of State followed a low-key, non-intervention policy and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration did not make any effort to prevent the brutality and massacres beyond again expressing private dismay.</p>
                <p>Chapters on Congo and the Horn of Africa highlight the growing U.S relationship with President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> of Zaire and Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> of Ethiopia as the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration attempted to create strong, pro-American governments in those two key African countries, especially through military assistance and sales of military equipment. On the other hand, in the Horn of Africa chapter, the volume documents the deterioration of U.S. relations with the Somali Republic. The virtual breakdown of U.S. relations with Uganda under the erratic leadership of President <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName> is documented in the Uganda chapter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> electronic-only volumes follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and Publishing Division. The original text is reproduced exactly, including marginalia or other notations, which are both visible on the facsimile copy of the document and described in the source note. There is also a text version of the document. The editors have supplied a heading, a summary, and a source note with additional relevant information, as required, for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected in the text file. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the text, and a list of abbreviations, persons, and sources accompanies the volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text file to indicate text omitted by the editors because it deals with an unrelated subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is blacked-out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type) appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source note, and a bracketed note indicating the number of pages not declassified. These denied documents are listed in their chronological place in the volume.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation reviews records, advises, and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Historical Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The Historical Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and reviews volumes, as it deems necessary, to fulfill its advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act Review</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House officials, since these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and related implementing public access regulations require NARA to notify formally the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> estate and former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House staff members that the agency is scheduling for public release <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House historical materials. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and former White House staff members have 30 days to contest the release of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> historical materials in which they were a participant or are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to segregate and return to the creator of files private and personal materials. All <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that include materials from NARAʼs <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Staff are processed and released in accordance with the PRMPA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National Security Information, and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 2000 and was completed in 2005, resulted in the decision to withhold 4 documents in full, to excise a paragraph or more in 9 documents, and to make minor excisions in 22 documents. The editors are confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described above, that this volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the first Nixon administration toward sub-Saharan Africa, 1969–1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Acknowledgments</hi>
                </p>

                <p>The editors also wish to acknowledge the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> Estate for allowing access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential recordings, and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> Library &amp; Birthplace for facilitating that access.</p>
                <p>Joseph Hilts did the research, initial selection, and initial annotation of the volume. Upon his retirement, David C. Humphrey revised the volume and reorganized it to make it conform to the new electronic-only format. Edward C. Keefer, General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, reviewed the volume.</p>
                <p>Susan C. Weetman, Chief of the Declassification and Publishing Division, and Chris Tudda coordinated the declassification review. Chris Tudda also compiled the list of sources. Carl Ashley, Renée A. Goings, and Jennifer Walele performed the copy and technical editing.</p>

                        <p>The decline of prospects for Communist-oriented radicalism in Africa has apparently led Moscow to some shifts of emphasis in its approach to black Africa. Moscow now seems unwilling to depend so heavily on such allies as Nkrumah, and may have moved Africa somewhat farther down on its order of priorities. New tactics include a more extensive diplomatic presence and some new aid and training overtures to the African military elite. The new Soviet approach to Africa is more varied than the old, but still contains inherent contradictions. Though the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now portrays itself as a respectable and friendly great power, it has not abandoned its cultivation of assets for political subversion.</p>
                        <p>The African elite tends to view Soviet ideology as irrelevant, and is still culturally attuned to the West. Moreover, this elite, though eager for aid from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or any other source, is growing more nationalistic and suspicious of foreigners. Even if new leftist leaders emerge, as seems likely, we doubt that the Soviets will find them easy to influence or control.</p>

                            <item>After a decade of grappling with the problems of black Africa, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is still casting about for an effective approach to the African elite. A good deal of the Soviet investment in black Africa went down the drain with the sudden overturn of friendly regimes in Ghana and Mali. The Soviets, despite prolonged cultivation of these governments through economic and military aid, cultural exchanges, scholarships, and political tutelage, had made no permanent impact and had failed to create a substantial cadre of pro-Moscow devotees.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>One result of these coups seemed to be a realization in Moscow that the Soviets still did not understand the Africans. Soviet African experts appear unsure of how to apply Marxism-Leninism to African societies and recognize that “revolutionary-democratic” single party states in black Africa are likely to be unstable even with Soviet support. Clearly the Soviets are still feeling their way, and their new tactics in Africa reflect a greater degree of flexibility and caution.</item>

                            <item>Apparently in an effort to learn more about the Africans and to expand contacts with them, the Soviets are building up the staffs of their black African embassies, even in insignificant countries. For example, the Soviet embassies in Sierra Leone, Dahomey, and CAMEROON each have over 20 accredited diplomatic personnel, as well as the usual complement of wives, chauffeurs, and janitors. They are demonstrating their willingness to deal amicably with regimes currently in power, regardless of their political leanings. Thus they are working with Chadʼs Tombalbaye and Senegalʼs Senghor, who are among the most conservative African statesmen. The Soviets have also expanded their already generous scholarship and travel programs. They are using less arm twisting and fewer subversive schemes than in past years and are portraying themselves as a respectable, benevolent great power. Their policies have not, however, changed so much as to eliminate the conflict between open diplomacy and subversion.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Moscow is currently stressing military aid and training as a convenient and inexpensive way to increase its influence in black Africa. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has always been less concerned than the Western powers about arms build-ups in <pb n="4" xml:id="d1-04" facs="d1-04"/>Africa and, indeed, has exploited Western reluctance to meet some of the more extravagant African arms requests. In recent years, the Soviets have provided substantial military aid to Nigeria and Somalia. Moreover, they apparently encourage requests in both countries for additional aid. In addition, the Soviets have offered military aid to Congo (Kinshasa) and Ethiopia, key countries now largely dependent on US support but uncertain of future US policies. In each case, Moscow is demonstrating its willingness to deal with relatively pro-Western regimes that have shown little interest in following the “non-capitalist road to development”. Each has something of interest to the Soviets: Nigeria, Congo (Kinshasa), and Ethiopia their size and potential wealth, Somalia its long Indian Ocean coastline and its suitability for utilization by Soviet space scientists.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>In addition to government-to-government activities, the Soviets are trying to establish personal contacts with the military elite in black African states. This makes some sense in view of the current vogue of military coups, which have thrust African officers into a dozen or so presidential palaces. During 1968, about 500 Soviet military technicians served in black Africa, 250 in Somalia alone. A Soviet <pb n="5" xml:id="d1-05" facs="d1-05"/>military attache (the second in black Africa) has recently been assigned to Nigeria. Moreover, approximately 1,000 black Africans are receiving military training in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Of course, Moscow still has a long way to go to match the influence of the former metropoles on the African military elite, but it is clearly trying.</item>

                            <item>On the other hand, the Soviets have been much less forthcoming on requests for additional economic assistance in the last few years.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3" type="source">In 1965, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> extended to black Africa credits and grants worth over $50 million; in 1968, it furnished just over $5 million.</note> The Soviets have stopped offering massive lines of credit and have been much more careful about committing funds, even to apparently feasible projects. Like many Western creditors, they have had trouble collecting on their debts. They do not want to spend money on projects with uncertain political benefits. In Nigeria, for example, despite signing an agreement for economic cooperation last November, the Soviets have yet to come through with any significant commitments. This stands in sharp contrast to the speed with which the Soviets responded to Nigeriaʼs request to buy arms.</item>

                            <item>The Soviet presence is a recent phenomenon in black Africa. The African elite, Western oriented by tradition and training, tend to look upon the Soviets as strangers with unfamiliar habits and language. To some extent this is an advantage, for those fed up with the colonial influence and receptive to some radical ideas find the Soviets a fresh, promising alternative to the West. The Soviets, quick to take advantage of this reaction, cultivate the restless ones in labor unions, civil service, the army, and elsewhere. Young, impressionable types are offered scholarships; older ones are given trips to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>It is still too early to tell if Moscow is getting its moneyʼs worth out of the 5,000 or so black African students currently on scholarship in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But it is worth noting that the Soviets tend to accept students with low academic qualifications, many of whom cannot make the grade. Some are pulled aside for political indoctrination, but few who have already returned to their home countries appear to have been converted to the Communist cause. Though impressed with some of the visible accomplishments of socialism, <pb n="7" xml:id="d1-07" facs="d1-07"/>many students are critical of the racial prejudice and restrictions they meet in Soviet society and resent spending a year or two learning a language virtually useless to them back home. Moreover, they are not usually as well trained to pursue their vocations (mostly the civil service) as those educated in the Western tradition. Often, e.g., in Kenya and Ghana, students returning from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have had a difficult time finding jobs because prospective employers are suspicious of their Soviet connections and unimpressed with their qualifications, especially in technical fields.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>In those countries where Soviet influence has been significant in the past, few of the elite apparently turned to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for ideological inspiration. They did, however, accept the material benefits of Soviet interest, and professed enough attachment to the socialist cause to keep the aid coming. So far as we can tell, such elaborate, Soviet-sponsored institutions as the Kwame Nkrumah Institute of Economics and Political Science in Ghana, the Higher Party School in Mali, and the Polytechnic Institute in Guinea failed utterly to produce a crop of ideologically committed African communists. The largely foreign faculties had trouble <pb n="8" xml:id="d1-08" facs="d1-08"/>communicating with the students and tended to quarrel among themselves about ideological definitions. Similar problems hindered the ambitious joint Soviet-Ghanaian apparatus for conducting clandestine operations out of Ghana against other African countries. Moreover, the Soviets, by close association with the governments of Ghana and Mali, had placed themselves in an exposed position. The Soviets were blamed as well as the overthrown leaders for the mess left behind. Consequently the disappearance of these governments brought a considerable drop in Soviet influence and prestige.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Even where regimes courted by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are still in power -- Guinea and Tanzania -- the Soviets have found little gratitude for their investments and are unable to match the Communist Chinese in providing ideological inspiration. The local elite tend to ask what the Soviets have done for them lately. We see little to suggest that Sekou Toure still seeks comfort and guidance from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, though his speeches are full of Marxist slogans and his state and party institutions are still based on the Soviet model. Apparently he has not overcome his enduring suspicion of the Soviets, who once tried to subvert teachers in his own party. Nyerere, unhappy with Soviet military training programs, Soviet <pb n="9" xml:id="d1-09" facs="d1-09"/>failure to provide economic aid on easy terms, and Soviet initiatives in Czechoslovakia and Nigeria, has turned out to be an especially unreliable friend. Moreover, he suspects Moscow of encouraging his exiled political rival, Oscar Kambona. Both Toure and Nyerere, currently impressed by the Communist Chinese rhetoric, are devising methods of bringing the inert mass of peasantry into the political mainstream and in the process have borrowed slogans from the Chinese cultural revolution.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Most black African leaders remain suspicious of all big powers, and some are developing distinctly xenophobic tendencies. A few Western oriented states, such as Togo and Niger, while wanting the economic benefits of Soviet aid, are especially wary of Communist subversion. Several have objected to the size of the Soviet diplomatic missions in their countries. Ghana went so far as to seize two Soviet fishing trawlers on charges that the ships had intruded into territorial waters and their crews were meddling in internal affairs. Ghanaians claimed that the crews were plotting to restore Nkrumah and detained them for several months despite mounting protests from the Soviet government.</item>

                            <item>Nationalism is likely to remain the dominant theme in African politics as in African attitudes toward the outside world. In so far as the African elite will be susceptible to foreign influence, we think they will probably remain culturally attuned to the West and not very attracted to or influenced by Soviet ideology. Though willing to accept aid from anyone, the elite will not be of much service to Moscow unless they become much more disillusioned with the West than they are today. Any further deterioration in African relations with the West will improve Soviet opportunities to extend their influence. For example, the Soviets are winning friends among Nigerian civil servants by offering more support to the war effort than the West, and have convinced some influential Nigerians that Westerners simply cannot help being neo-colonialist.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>Current Soviet aid policies will probably not win the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> many new friends among the African elite. The cut-backs in economic aid will be resented, especially in those countries to which it has been of major importance in the past. Soviet scholarship programs seem unlikely to gain <pb n="11" xml:id="d1-11" facs="d1-11"/>suddenly the relevance they have lacked for the last ten years. On the other hand, Moscow may have better luck finding support among the young military elite because of the stepped-up military aid and training efforts. In an age when military coups seem inevitable, the Soviets may see some friends take power, if only for a short time.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>In addition to these efforts, the Soviets will probably continue to support some clandestine organizations even in those countries, such as Ethiopia, where they are trying to improve relations with the government. Similarly, they will likely persist in supporting individuals, whom they believe to be ideologically sympathetic, even when these men are in the ranks of the local opposition. This, however, is a risky business. In gambling that such clandestine support will produce friendlier governments, Moscow would risk alienating leaders it has been wooing.</item>
                            <label>15.</label>
                            <item>Should new African radicals come to power over the next few years, with or without Soviet clandestine support, Moscow would be tempted to claim that “revolutionary-democratic” leaders, despite temporary reversals, were back <pb n="12" xml:id="d1-12" facs="d1-12"/>for good. But the Soviet tendency to rely too heavily on such types is likely to prove as embarrassing in the future as it has in the past, largely because black African national-ism is growing along with xenophobia. Once in office, African leftists tend to be more African than leftist. Such radicals would not necessarily be very susceptible to Soviet guidance or even follow policies pleasing to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Much depends on whether or not the Soviets learn to accept Africans as they are and stop trying to squeeze them into a Marxist-Leninist mold.</item>

                        <p>After an exchange of courtesies, the Ambassador said relations between the United States and Kenya were excellent and he had nothing of a bilateral nature to raise. However, he wanted to mention two points concerning U.S. policy toward Africa in general. First he wished the U.S. would formulate and follow an independent policy toward Africa instead of always following the lead of other major Western powers such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and France. He said the practice of following others occurred during the previous U.S. administration and appeared to be continuing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could not agree that the U.S. did not act independently. It was true that we did not rush in with solutions to every problem, but when we did act it was in accordance with our own best judgment. We did not believe that we could solve all African problems and, furthermore, we felt that the independent, responsible African states wished to and could take care of most situations on their own or through their multi-lateral organizations. He said the U.S. was prepared to discuss any problem raised with us and to help in any way it could, but did not feel it should take unwarranted initiatives. He cited the example of Nigeria where the U.S. position was different from that of either the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> or France. Instead of becoming involved with either side to the Nigerian conflict, the U.S. was doing everything it could to provide relief to the victims and yet the U.S. was being blamed for not solving the problem.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d2-02" facs="d2-02"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Nabwera said that Kenya welcomed the U.S. position on Nigeria which was similar to its own. Kenya regretted that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had provided arms to the Nigerian Federal Government and that France, for its own reasons, was supplying arms to the Eastern Region. That outside interference complicated the situation and made it more difficult for a solution to be achieved. The Ambassador said the particular area where he hoped the U.S. would act independently and strongly was with regard to southern Africa, including South Africa, Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies. He expressed the hope that the U.S. would use its considerable power and influence to bring about a solution in the interest of the Africans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that on the principles involved, the U.S. stood with the Africans and there would be no change in U.S. policy in that regard. However, the U.S. did not have as much power and influence to affect situations as it was often credited with having. Also the U.S. did not believe it should initiate or support irresponsible, impractical, unrealistic statements or acts which could do nothing to improve a situation or might even be counter-productive. We would do whatever seemed practical and useful to uphold and promote our principles, but we recognized, and hoped others would recognize, that our power to affect situations was not very great.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the other point he wished to mention was the impression among Africans that the U.S. was not giving much attention to Africa. He hoped that the Secretaryʼs next trip, instead of being to Europe or some other part of the world, would be to Africa so that he could get to know the realities of the continent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had been to West Africa some years ago and would be happy to visit the continent again, and particularly East Africa, as soon as he could. The conversation then turned to a discussion of tourism in East Africa after which it ended.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Most of my day-to-day battles are fought out in the murky reaches of the 6th floor at State -- with a Bureau which is neither top heavy with talent nor excessively realistic about Africaʼs priority in U.S. foreign policy. I understand that I am paid to shield you from the unsavoury details of that process. But I thought it would be informative (and maybe fair warning) to give you a random sample of some issues now percolating in the bureaucracy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">1. <hi rend="underline">Nigeria</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My task here has been to get State to face up to the critical period that lies immediately ahead in the civil war. I outlined in detail some of these problems in the two-month prospectus you requested last week -- to wit, a harsh occupation and belligerent foreign policy by the Federals if they win; endemic instability and tribal strife win <hi rend="underline">or</hi> lose.</p>
                        <p>I have been pushing roughly along two tracks. First, we need to begin <hi rend="underline">now</hi> some intensive contingency planning on possible developments following this current Federal offensive. For example: if we are backing the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, we should have a clear idea of how far we are willing to go in support of peace-keeping operations. We have got to have a plausible and thoughtful answer to Congressional critics who are likely to raise the spector of genocide in the wake of a Federal victory. We should know the alternatives and risks in post-war aid for a Federal side that may disintegrate even after it wins the civil war. And finally, as wrenching as it is for my State colleagues, they have to deal with the prospect of recognizing Biafra if the reality comes to that. All this I am trying to spur forward with my own thoughts and some general goading around town.</p>
                        <p>The second track carries more immediate problems. I asked for an African IG meeting last week when I discovered we were about to handle in the most-routine manner the sale of IT&amp;T military radios to the Feds. This is a private deal, but it does require an export license from Commerce. <pb n="2" xml:id="d3-02" facs="d3-02"/>In effect, we would be endorsing the sale when our policy is a complete arms embargo on both-sides of the civil war. State had given the initial go-ahead, however, on the grounds that (a) the items were non-lethal, and (b) we had approved a similar sale in August 1967. My concern was that even a sale of radios now could make a good Senate speech for anyone trying to discredit the Presidentʼs scrupulous non-involvement in the civil war.</p>
                        <p>A related problem is to guard that we donʼt slip through at this stage any commitments to the Feds on post-war aid or rehabilitation. Our Embassy in Lagos all along has had a penchant for feathering our nest in Nigeria, based on their far too roseate view of the countryʼs future.</p>
                        <p>State is now pledged to keep a careful eye on both the radios and aid conversations with the Feds. I understand Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> is bucking the radio sale question to the 7th floor. Iʼll put in my 2 cents on the subject with Richardsonʼs people, but I may still have to ask you to make a demarche if the problem doesnʼt get a careful look. Pending the 7th floor persuasion to the contrary, I donʼt think the radio sale is worth it (to IT&amp;T or in relations with the Feds) compared to the headaches it could cause us here at home.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">2. <hi rend="underline">Southern Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Work has begun on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study with predictable confusion and bureaucratic back-biting. State is dearly wed to the present hortatory policy, and would prefer something tougher if they can get it. Defense wants a softer line, but so much so that they have trouble defining what is realistic at the outer range of the options. Perforce, I have been operating as a sometime mediator in the IG Working Group, and have done a good deal of the first drafting. It is too early for real optimism, but I think we should have a fairly decent paper for the President. It will certainly reopen the policy debate on Southern Africa that has been stifled since 1961.</p>
                        <p>I understand Dean Acheson has his contribution on Southern Africa in draft. I should have some presentable draft options for his further comment and criticism, if that seems useful, later this week.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">3. <hi rend="underline">Conte-Long Problems with the Congo</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I sent you a piece last week on the Conte-Long issue over the Rapier missiles purchased by Zambia. The African IG is now wrestling with a similar problem with the Congo left over from the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Administration. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is apparently contracting to buy 15 Macchi trainer jets from Italy, <pb n="3" xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>with the clear intention of arming them as fighters of the Congolese Air Force. On one hand, State is arguing that the Macchis are not sophisticated -- which is a point I fail to appreciate for a country where 15 white men with sten guns have constituted an invasion force and a major threat to territorial integrity. They are also willing to argue, however, that the President can reasonably determine to the Congress that Congolese jets are “important to the national security of the United States.” I stick on that argument also.</p>
                        <p>The other side of the coin is that enforcement of the Conte-Long penalties (in this case $7 million) would be very hard on our aid program in the Congo at a time when the country has found its first tranquil moment since independence. Frankly, Iʼm not sure now where I come out on this question. But I am persuaded at the outset that we cannot dodge the issue with the Congress. In the long run, flimsy evasion of the amendment will do a lot more than $7 million worth of damage to Congolese development.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">4. <hi rend="underline">Succession Problems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In another effort to fill some major gaps in planning, Iʼm trying to persuade State and Defense to take a careful look at places like Ethiopia and Kenya, where the passing of elderly autocrats could create a volatile political reaction. The Ethiopian case is particularly noteworthy because (a) there is clearly no established line to the Emperorʼs successor, and (b) the country ranks near the top of our political and military interests in Africa. I am also tying this contingency planning for Ethiopia to the danger I flagged for you last week -- a possible attack by tribal dissidents on the major U.S. communications facility at Kagnew Station in the northern province of Eritrea.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">5. <hi rend="underline">The African Aid Program</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The problem here is painfully plain. On a Continent where development is the overriding job, we lack (a) money, (b) a long-run development strategy, and (c) a clear sense of short-run priorities. Again, I am trying to spark some new ideas and a reappraisal of practiced dogma. I am about convinced, however, that this may be fair game for a formal NSSM. The President should have his own African policy, but unless we get hold of aid strategy, weʼll miss one-half of our policy stake on the Continent. Iʼll have a longer piece for you soon on this subject.</p>

                        <p>Here is another run-down to keep you posted on the more important African issues bubbling in the bureaucracy. I donʼt expect any of these problems to hit your desk very soon. But you should be aware of them as background.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                                    <hi rend="underline">Contingency Planning for Nigeria.</hi> As I reported earlier, I have been stumping for a careful look ahead at the range of possible circumstances following the latest Federal offensive of the civil war. The objective is to lay out for each plausible contingency (a) potential dangers to the U.S., (b) key issues we would face both in Nigeria and on the domestic front, and (c) the range of objectives and policy choices.</p>
                                <p>State has now come up with a first draft covering the cases of (1) continued stalemate, (2) a negotiated settlement, and (3) a Federal victory. (As usual, theyʼll leave thinking the unthinkable -- Biafran success -- to someone else.) Iʼm working over that draft now, and the African IG will have a first session on the plans at the end of this week. I see my job here as basically two-fold: not only to expose the nasty prospects and sure weʼre ready for them, but also to restrain the African Bureau in its love affair with the Federal side until the smoke has cleared and the President can make an unfettered choice.</p>
                            </item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="underline">Conte-Long Problem and the Congo.</hi> As you may recall again from my earlier report, this is a problem of deciding whether to dock the Congo $7 million in aid money for their purchase of 15 Macchi trainer jets from Italy. State was ready to ignore the Macchis almost routinely on the grounds that they were “unsophisticated” -- despite the fact that the Conte Amendment specifically refers to “jet aircraft.” And if the sophistication argument didnʼt wash, Joe Palmer was ready to go after a Presidential determination that Congolese purchase of the Macchi jets was “important to the national security of the United States.” The latter argument was obviously ludicrous, but the Macchis do point up the minor agonies of living with the Conte-Long Amendment.</p>
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d4-02" facs="d4-02"/>
                                <p>Macchi trainers are at the very bottom of the spectrum of jet air-craft in terms of age, cost and sophistication. They are, in fact, a less impressive weapon in many respects than many propeller aircraft. Then too, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> will buy them whatever we do. There are simply no other non-jets available from anybody by gift or sale. And the Congolese do have a case that ground support aircraft of this kind are an asset psycho-logically as well as militarily in holding the Congo together. Cutting the aid program only (i) hurts our political standing with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> and (ii) penalizes the economic development which is still the best medicine against future instability in the Congo -- and all this <hi rend="underline">without</hi> restraining weapons purchases.</p>
                                <p>As it is, the African IG will buck this one eventually to the Under Secretaryʼs Committee as part of the package that <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hannah</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> et al. could raise with the Congress in trying to get some modification of the amendment. On balance, I think this is the kind of case Congress would understand as being beyond the intent of the legislation. The important point to get across at State has been that we should lay these problems out fully and frankly, rather than sneak through a quiet judgment that leaves us vulnerable later.</p>

                                    <hi rend="underline">Southern Africa</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study here is in its final stage, though the tough IG negotiating sessions are still ahead next week. (The paper is due to the Review Group May 30.) I think we will produce, after all, a reasonably credible array of “soft” choices as well as the harder lines. The general policy choice is surrounded by thorny operational issues like the Rhodesian chrome problem, South African sugar quota, etc. I see the task as to give the President a sharp and unencumbered choice on posture, yet include some flavor of the lesser actions that add up to policy.</p>
                                <p>Roughly, the paper poses a basic policy choice on posture toward the white minority regimes: (a) ease up, (b) talk tough but keep dealing, and (c) disengage. Within that choice are four major issues:

                                            </hi>: back <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> pressures or soft pedal.</item>
                                        <item>-- <hi rend="underline">Black States and Insurgents:</hi> economic aid and sympathy or minimal involvement.</item>

                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d4-03" facs="d4-03"/>
                                <p>These choices encompass, of course, some very fundamental judgments about Africaʼs importance to us, the volatility of the racial issue in world politics, the interplay of ideals and interest in foreign policy, etc. I recognize my clients are more often a source of irritation or amusement rather than stimulation. But I think youʼll find Southern Africa an interesting intellectual issue.</p>

                                    <hi rend="underline">Review of African Aid</hi>. Iʼve put off proposing a NSSM to review aid strategy because Joe Palmer is leaving this month. I think it makes sense bureaucratically to let his successor move in and then move forward on a major review.</p>
                                <p>The object would be to reassess the Korry Report of 1966-67, which took us out of bilateral aid and into the present “regional” strategy. There are some obvious holes in this approach, mainly because regional projects are still not very relevant to the rudimentary stage of African development. Moreover, we are still pouring money on dubious clients like Liberia, whose corruption and sloth taints us politically. If weʼre going to be tough-minded and make the most of limited resources in Africa, we have to start by harnessing aid policy to the Presidentʼs approach.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Despite the general failure of Communist Chinaʼs once wide-ranging diplomatic efforts in the developing world, Peking has been able to maintain and expand a significant presence in a handful of African states. It has attached considerable importance to this remnant of conventional Chinese diplomacy during a period when Cultural Revolution excesses have disrupted its relations with most of the world. Peking has displayed a surprisingly low-keyed and circumspect diplomatic posture in its African foothold. Although its effort in these few African states is centered around a generally well-received aid program, its eagerness to cooperate with host African governments in support of black nationalist “liberation movements” has also redounded to Pekingʼs favor. Because of these relatively favorable circumstances and Pekingʼs rather bleak prospects elsewhere in the world, Africa probably will remain a major area of Chinese diplomacy. Any significant expansion of Chinese influence there appears unlikely, however, particularly in view of the competition Peking faces from foreign rivals and the poor image it continues to project throughout most of Africa.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">BACKGROUND</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the early 1960s Peking began a large-scale effort to establish itself as a major influence on the African continent. Increasing numbers of African states were gaining independence and experimenting with a wide range of domestic and international policies, often radical in nature. Peking hoped to encourage such radical tendencies and establish an “anti-imperialist” African bloc amenable to Chinese guidance. To this end the Chinese employed opportunistic and free-wheeling tactics aimed at developing a broad presence in a short time. Speed was essential because Pekingʼs major rivals, the Soviet Union, the Western powers, and Nationalist China were also attempting to cultivate the Africans. Chinese diplomatic missions to Africa were increased; prominent Chinese leaders, including Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, made extensive good will tours to drum up diplomatic support. African delegations were encouraged to visit Peking, and promising African “revolutionaries” were sought out and occasionally brought to China for training. Chinese radiobroadcasts were beamed to Africa with increasing frequency, and a large number of New China News Agency offices were established on the continent.</p>
                        <p>Bribery, subversion, and aid to anticolonial and radical organizations in Africa also were utilized. In Zanzibar, where Peking quickly gained significant influence within the government apparatus, over half of the ruling council was on Chinese retainer by the mid 1960s.</p>

                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d5-05" facs="d5-05"/>
                        <p>Nevertheless, Chinaʼs ambitious Africa effort soon ran into trouble. Many African leaders were anxious to maintain a position of nonalignment and became increasingly alienated by doctrinaire Chinese insistence that they adopt narrow anti-Soviet and anti-US positions. Moreover, Pekingʼs heavy-handed and indiscriminate support of “revolutionary action” in Africa gradually aroused a deep suspicion of Chinese sincerity and intentions. The discovery of Chinese subversive activities in Burundi, Congo (Kinshasa) and Ghana served as a warning to these and other African governments.</p>
                        <p>The overthrow of governments friendly to the Chinese in a few other states painfully pointed out to Peking the risks involved in seeking influence in such politically unstable areas, and further limited Chinaʼs presence on the continent. Additionally, many African leaders were accepting generous offers of economic and military assistance from Moscow and the West–offers which Peking apparently felt it could not match. In Algeria, for example, Pekingʼs efforts were overwhelmed by a massive Soviet military and economic aid commitment.</p>
                        <p>The recall of diplomats and Pekingʼs increasingly militant diplomacy during the early stages of the Cultural Revolution detracted further from Chinaʼs position on the continent. Although the Chinese generally isolated their prime interests in Africa from the worst effects of the radical “Red Guard diplomacy,” overbearing political tactics, including preaching Maoʼs thought and virulent attacks against the Soviet Union, strained Pekingʼs relations with Congo (Brazzaville), Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. Significant Chinese presence in Africa became limited to a mere handful of states.</p>
                        <p>Despite these setbacks, the Chinese have continued to maintain and develop a limited foot-hold in Africa, largely through a generally well-received foreign aid program. At present, Peking is the strongest foreign presence in Tanzania, has a growing position in Zambia, and has aid programs in Guinea, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p rend="center">AFRICAʼS SPECIAL ROLE IN CURRENT CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY</p>
                        <p>The Maoist world view assigns Peking the roles of leader of the world revolution, champion of “peoples liberation movements” and supporter of Afro-Asian nationalism against white racism, colonialism and neocolonialism. In terms of Chinese ideology, therefore, Africa has been and will remain important to Peking. At a time when China stands isolated to an unprecedented degree from the international community, it must take some comfort in its relative success in even a handful of African states.</p>
                        <p>The states of primary Chinese concern--Tanzania, Guinea, Zambia, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), and Mauritania—are all ruled by nationalistic, independent-minded leaders. They do not take direction from any Western state or the Soviet Union, and have periodically agreed with Pekingʼs point of view on certain world issues. These states have all encouraged Pekingʼs support for African and Asian “peopleʼs liberation” movements, have publicly opposed US “imperialism and neocolonialism,” and most have denounced the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia. A few of the more radical states, most notably Guinea, have enthusiastically praised the “success” of the Cultural Revolution in China.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these relatively favorable political circumstances, Pekingʼs effort in Africa appears to be one of the few areas in which the Chinese leadership is generally agreed on strategy in foreign affairs. Even the staunchest advocate of “revolutionary diplomacy” in Peking could hardly fault Chinaʼs efforts in the above six states <pb n="6" xml:id="d5-06" facs="d5-06"/>which follow policies that correspond in varying degrees to the demands of Maoist ideology. On the other hand, the more pragmatic elements of the Chinese leadership, together with Foreign Ministry professionals, doubtless have welcomed the opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of conventional diplomacy in at least a limited area.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Pekingʼs current interest in these African states is also a reflection of its limited possibilities in other parts of the developing world. The Chinese have traditionally regarded the developing “third world” as the area of greatest opportunity for their diplomacy, but a combination of factors has critically limited Pekingʼs sphere of effective activity in recent years. Chinaʼs rigid ideological posture, as well as stepped-up competition from Moscow and strong US commitments, has blocked significant advances in Asia. In the Middle East, Pekingʼs inability to back up its calls for an Arab “peopleʼs war” with substantial amounts of military and economic assistance has left these states within the Soviet pale, while the possible intrusion of Chinese revolutionary influence into Latin America has been effectively blocked by Pekingʼs own blunders and by the presence of Castroʼs influence during the past ten years. As a result, the Chinese have apparently had little choice but to concentrate their efforts in the few states where competition is less intense.</p>
                        <p>For the most part, the Chinese have displayed a surprisingly low-keyed and circumspect diplomatic approach—moving ahead with a foreign aid program at a time when Chinese foreign relations elsewhere were largely paralyzed. Some African leaders have criticized Western and Soviet aid programs as too expensive and elaborate. By contrast, Pekingʼs relatively simple, labor intensive, and inexpensive projects have met with approval. Chinese technicians work hard and live closer to African standards than do their Western and Soviet counterparts—a fact generally noted with appreciation by the host governments. Most importantly, Chinese personnel have not engaged in the level of provocative propaganda activity which, during the period of “Red Guard diplomacy,” strained Chinese relations with other states throughout the world.</p>

                        <p>“Unlike the imperialist countries of the West and the modern revisionists who are plundering the recipient countries in the name of “aid,” Chinese assistance is designed to help recipient countries embark on the road of independent development and self-reliance. in accordance with Chairman Maoʼs teachings, the Chinese experts have been working hard and have forged a close friendship with the African workers.”</p>

                        <p>Since 1962, China has steadily improved its relations with Dar es Salaam; Tanzania now is Pekingʼs most important African base of operations and one of Chinaʼs foremost “foreign friends.” As in other African states of prime interest to Peking, success in Tanzania rests primarily on a well-run foreign aid program and a continued low-key diplomatic posture. China is the primary source of aid for Tanzaniaʼs military forces and a main source of that countryʼs economic development aid. The Chinese work closely with Tanzanians in arming and training Mozambique guerrillas. In 1967, Peking agreed to construct the 1,200-mile TanZam Railroad from the Zambian copper mines to Dar es Salaam—a major project to which the Tanzanian Government attaches great importance. The Chinese are rapidly completing the detailed engineering survey for the line. In addition to some 350 Chinese technicians engaged in the railway survey in 1968, Peking had another 500 technicians and advisers in the country and has given Dar es Salaam about $30 million in economic credits.</p>
                        <p>Tanzaniaʼs recent decision to terminate Canadian military assistance has left Peking with the dominant foreign role in all branches of Tanzaniaʼs security forces. Chinese aid has included small arms, trucks, antiaircraft guns, medium tanks, patrol boats, and landing craft. Commitments to future expansion of the Tanzanian armed forces include construction of a $1.5 million army barracks complex, a factory to produce small arms, and the construction of a naval base at Dar es Salaam. Tanzania was offered <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17s and pilot training by Peking in 1967 but in the meantime was considering proposals from both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Canada. Dar es Salaam has now rejected these proposals making it likely that Tanzania will now be the fifth nation to receive Chinese Communist <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Peking appears to view Zambia as one of its brightest prospects for future expansion. Although the Chinese had never before extended aid to the Lusaka government, in 1967 they gave it a $16.8 million interest free loan for the construction of a road from Lusaka to western Zambia. Soon after, they agreed to build the TanZam railroad which will give the Zambians an outlet for their copper through friendly Tanzania rather than Rhodesia. By supplying technicians and workers for their projects, the Chinese have been <pb n="8" xml:id="d5-08" facs="d5-08"/>increasing their presence in the country, and there now are more than 300 Chinese technicians there. Although President <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> generally resists large foreign influences in his country, he has sanctioned the Chinese presence. He has been pleased with their apparently well-managed work and the generous terms of Chinese aid,-but he is aware of Chinaʼs past record in Africa and undoubtedly will maintain a close surveillance.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">CONTINUED SUCCESS IN GUINEA; UNCERTAINTY IN MALI</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The radical Guinea Government has the longest history of Chinese assistance, dating back to 1959. Chinese relations with the Conakry regime have been cordial even though President Toure in recent years has sought to play East against West and Moscow against Peking. Through 1968 the Chinese had extended almost $60 million in economic credits to the Guineans, of which almost $38 million had been drawn. Peking further consolidated its position in Conakry by agreeing a year ago to help construct the 200-mile Guinea-Mali railroad—a project now in doubt because of the coup in Mali last November. Although the Chinese commitment in Guinea to date has consisted entirely of economic and technical assistance, an exchange of military delegations between Peking and Conakry last year indicated that Peking is making an effort to gain influence within the Guinean military, which has been receiving assistance from Soviet bloc nations.</p>
                        <p>Mali has been another major target of Chinaʼs effort to gain influence in Africa, al-though the overthrow of the radical Keita government last November has cast considerable doubt on Pekingʼs future status there. Since 1961 China has dispersed $35 million of economic aid in Mali and at the end of 1968 had almost 900 technicians in the country. Since the fall of the Keita government and his replacement by a moderate military regime, Peking has taken a more cautious and circumspect approach, avoiding any public comment on the new Malian leadership. With the exception of the Guinea-Mali railroad, however, the Chinese seem to be continuing to follow through on projects already under way, apparently in the hope of maintaining a presence in the country.</p>

                        <p>The aid programs in Congo (Brazzaville) and Mauritania are smaller, but the Chinese nevertheless continue to demonstrate an active interest in both states. Elsewhere in Africa, however, significant Chinese presence and influence are almost nil. Soviet competition has been especially troublesome to Peking; Moscowʼs aid programs in Algeria and ʼSomalia have served to undercut Chinaʼs efforts there, and the Soviet presence in Congo (Brazzaville), Mali, and Guinea also represents a potential threat to Pekingʼs position. Moreover, Nationalist Chinaʼs persistent efforts to expand its presence on the continent have met with considerable success in recent years. This is, perhaps, the most dramatic reflection of Pekingʼs general failure in Africa. At present the <pb n="9" xml:id="d5-09" facs="d5-09"/>Nationalist Government is recognized by 21 African governments, and the Communists must find Taipeiʼs limited but exceptionally efficient aid program especially galling.</p>

                        <p>“At present, the African peopleʼs revolutionary. struggles against imperialism, colonialism, and neocolonialism are developing in depth. In conjunction with the anti-imperialist national revolutionary movements in Asia and Latin America, the national revolutionary movement in Africa is forcefully pounding and weakening the foundation of the rule of imperialism, colonialism, and neocolonialism and it is a component part of the anti-imperialist revolutionary front of our time.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Although state-to-state relations have been the primary sphere of Chinese activity in Africa, Peking has also used aid to African nationalist and other insurgent groups to develop its influence on the continent. In general, the assistance consists of varying amounts of small arms and financial support as well as Chinese sponsored guerrilla <pb n="10" xml:id="d5-10" facs="d5-10"/>training in Africa or China, political instruction, and propaganda support. Most of the Chinese-backed movements are small and to date have demonstrated little capability for successful revolutionary action. Nevertheless Pekingʼs assistance has strengthened its ties to those African governments which are most committed to the black nationalist movements—notably Tanzania, Zambia, and Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The most effective insurgent group substantially supported by the Chinese is the Mozambique Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_FRELIMO1">FRELIMO</gloss>). This relatively large Tanzania-based organization probably receives half of its military aid from China. <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO1">FRELIMO</gloss> has managed to gain control of small Mozambique areas which border on Tanzania. The Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, a much smaller, ineffective group based in Zambia which split from <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO1">FRELIMO</gloss> in 1964, also has received limited Chinese aid. In addition, the Chinese have extended token aid to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, which is dependent on the Soviet Union for most of its support.</p>
                        <p>Peking is a major supporter of the Zimbabwe African National Union, a small Rhodesian group which split from the larger Soviet-backed Zimbabwe African Peopleʼs Union in 1963. In Guinea, the Chinese provide limited assistance to the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and the Cape Verde Islands, an anti-Portuguese nationalist group, despite the fact that the Soviet Union is this groupʼs primary supplier. The Pan African Congress, a small Tanzania-based South African organization, also receives some token assistance.</p>
                        <p>Aside from African nationalist groups, Peking has recently given limited support to a small Ethiopian insurgency group, certain Congolese rebels opposed to the anti-Chinese Mobutu regime in Kinshasa, and to Oginga Odinga, a dissident Kenyan politician. Last fall Peking belatedly endorsed Biafran independence and agreed “in principle” to supply aid to the rebel regime-a move primarily designed to please Tanzanian President <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>, a strong advocate of Biafra. Although Peking has been replacing Chinese arms given to Biafra by Tanzania, it has shown little interest in assuming a more direct involvement in the Nigerian civil war.</p>

                        <p>“We get along very well with the Chinese. One either gets along well with them or one doesnʼt get along at all.”</p>

                        <p>Because of its importance ideologically and Pekingʼs rather bleak prospects elsewhere, Africa is likely to remain an area of major focus for Chinese diplomacy in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the short term prospect for a significant expansion of Chinese influence there appears negligible. In general, the conditions that caused the collapse of Chinaʼs more ambitious and wider efforts in the early 1960s still prevail. Chinaʼs image in Africa remains tarnished by the convulsive disorder of the Cultural Revolution, and Pekingʼs continuing support for dissidents in their struggle against the black-ruled nations of Congo (Kinshasa) and Kenya probably has further reinforced the general African suspicion of Chinese intentions.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Chinaʼs position in the foothold it now enjoys is far from secure. Although the host governments have generally been ideologically appealing to the Chinese and receptive to Pekingʼs advances, they have avoided any significant political commitments to Peking. On the contrary, the <pb n="11" xml:id="d5-11" facs="d5-11"/>Chinese generally have achieved a continuing presence in Africa simply by “paying off” certain African states with generous foreign aid offers. In general, the governments which have accepted assistance have been careful to maintain an independent posture while merely accepting the aid program best suited to their national interest.</p>
                        <p>On the plus side, Chinaʼs low-keyed effort in these few African states demonstrates that, in reasonably auspicious circumstances, Peking is capable of effective diplomacy and suggests somepromise over the long term for Chinese diplomatic efforts throughout the developing Afro-Asian world. To date, however, Peking has shown little sign of trying to enhance its appeal by down playing indiscriminate championing of “peoples war” and abandoning its penchant for alienating potential friends for the sake of ideological principle. Until Peking is willing to abandon this militant and doctrinaire Maoist approach to foreign affairs, Chinaʼs potential for leadership or even influence in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world will remain largely unrealized.</p>

                        <p>“We know you have no easy task in seeking to assure a fair share of Africaʼs wealth to all her peoples. We know that the realization of equality and human dignity throughout the continent will be long and arduous in coming. But you can be sure as you pursue these difficult goals that the United States shares your hopes and your confidence in the future.”</p>
                        <p rend="center">Presidentʼs Message<lb/>to the Sixth Annual<lb/>Assembly of the Organization<lb/>of African Unity,<lb/>September 6, 1969.</p>
                        <p>In this greeting last September to the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity, I expressed Americaʼs determination to support our African friends as they work to fulfill their continentʼs high promise. <pb n="3" xml:id="d7-03" facs="d7-03"/>The unprecedented visit of the Secretary of State to Africa this month is a confirmation of this support.</p>
                        <p>One of the most dramatic and far-reaching changes of the last decade was the emergence of an independ. ent Africa.</p>
                        <p>Only ten years ago, 32 countries covering nearly five-sixths of the Continent were still colonies, their voices silent in world affairs. Today, these are all sovereign nations, proudly determined to shape their own future. And contrary to fears so often voiced at their birth, these nations did not succumb to Cornmunist subversion. Africa is one of the worldʼs most striking examples, in fact, of the failure of the appeal of Communism in the new nations. African states now comprise one-third of the membership of the United Nations. African issues have become important moral and political questions. African views justly merit and receive the attention of the world.</p>
                        <p>But this rebirth of a continent has been hazardous as well as hopeful. Africa was the scene of many of the recurrent crises of the 1960ʼs. There was the factional strife and international rivalry in the Congo, an arms race between Ethiopia and Somalia, the establishment of white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia, and the agonizing human loss in the Nigerian civil war.</p>
                        <p>The Continent still faces grave problems. The imbalances of economies and institutions once under full external control are only too evident today. Arbitrary boundaries drawn in European chancelleries left many African countries vulnerable to tribal strife; and no-where is the task of nation-building more taxing. Not least, Africans face the formidable task of strengthening their sense of identity and preserving traditional culture as their societies make the transition to modernity.</p>
                        <p>Over the last decade, America has not had a clear <pb n="4" xml:id="d7-04" facs="d7-04"/>conception of its relationship with post-colonial Africa and its particular problems. Because of our traditional support of self-determination, and Africaʼs historic ties with so many of our own citizens, our sympathy and friendship for the new Africa were spontaneous. But without a coherent concept to structure our policies, we allowed ourselves to concentrate more on temporary crises than on their underlying causes. We expressed our support for Africa more by lofty phrases than by candid and constructive dialogue.</p>
                        <p>Just as we focus our policies elsewhere to meet a new era, we will be clear with ourselves and with our African friends on Americaʼs interests and role in the Continent. We have two major concerns regarding the future of Africa:
<list>
                                <item>—That the Continent be free of great power rivalry or conflict in any form. This is even more in Africaʼs interest than in ours.</item>
                                <item>—That Africa realize its potential to become a healthy and prosperous region in the international community. Such an Africa would not only be a valuable economic partner for all regions, but would also have a greater stake in the maintenance of a durable world peace.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>These interests will guide our policies toward the most demanding challenges facing Africa in the 1970ʼs.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Development</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The primary challenge facing the African Continent is economic development.</p>
                        <p>If the 1960ʼs were years of high hopes and high rhetoric, the 1970ʼs will have to be years of hard work and hard choices. The African nations and those who assist them must decide together on strict priorities in employing the relatively limited development capital available <pb n="5" xml:id="d7-05" facs="d7-05"/>to the Continent. In doing this, Africa and its friends can benefit from several lessons of the past decade.</p>
                        <p>Certainly development will not always proceed as rapidly as the Africans and their friends hope. In many countries, needs will outrun local and international resources for some time. But solid and steady progress will be made if our common development investment concentrates on those basic if undramatic building blocks of economic growth—health, education, agriculture, transportation and local development. In particular, Africa will realize the full advantage of its own rich material resources only as it nurtures the wealth of its human resources. In close coordination with the Africansʼ own efforts, the United States will direct our aid at these fundamental building blocks.</p>
                        <p>Another lesson we have learned from the 1960ʼs is the need for close regional cooperation, in order for Africa to get the most from development resources. The United States will work with other donors and the Africans to help realize the potential for cooperative efforts—by the support which we are giving, for example, to the East African Economic Community and the promising regional groupings in West Africa. We will recognize, however, that regional action is not the only road for African development. In some cases, for geographic or political reasons, it will not work.</p>
                        <p>Our assistance throughout the Continent will be flexible and imaginative. We will make a particular effort—including programs of technical assistance and new encouragement of private investment—to help those countries not in a position to participate in regional projects.</p>
                        <p>We have learned that there are no panaceas for <pb n="6" xml:id="d7-06" facs="d7-06"/>African development. Each country faces its own problems, and the solutions to them must spring from the national experience of each country. Foreign ideologies have often proven notoriously irrelevant, and even tragically wasteful, as designs for African progress. The most creative conceptual approaches to African development should come, of course, from the Africans themselves. Outsiders cannot prescribe the political framework most conducive to Africaʼs economic growth. In some countries, progress has depended upon stability. Yet elsewhere, solutions to local problems have been found amid periods of uncertainty or even turmoil.</p>
                        <p>The United States will measure African progress in terms of long-run social and economic accomplishment, and not in the political flux which is likely to accompany growth.</p>
                        <p>In Africa, as throughout the developing world, our goal in providing development aid is clear. We want the Africans to build a better life for themselves and their children. We want to see an Africa free of poverty and disease, and free too of economic or political dependence on any outside power. And we want Africans to build this future as they think best, because in that way both our help and their efforts will be most relevant to their needs.</p>
                        <p>As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said in Ethiopia on February 12:</p>
                        <p>“As a developed nation, we recognize a special obligation to assist in the economic development of Africa. Our resources and our capacity are not unlimited. We have many demands at home. We will, however, continue to seek the means, both directly and in cooperation with others, to con-tribute more effectively to economic development in Africa.”</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d7-07" facs="d7-07"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Nationhood</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Africaʼs second challenge in the 1970ʼs will be to weather the inevitable strains which will come with the further development of nations which house a great diversity of peoples and cultures.</p>
                        <p>We have witnessed tragic manifestations of this problem in the civil strife in the Congo and Nigeria. The process of national integration may be stormy elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Such turmoil presents a tempting target to forces outside Africa ready to exploit the problems of change to their own advantage. But foreign intervention, what-ever its form or source, will not serve the long-run interests of the Africans themselves.</p>
                        <p>The United States approaches these problems of national integration with a policy which clearly recognizes the limits as well as the obligations of our partnership with Africa:
<list>
                                <item>—We will not intervene in the internal affairs of African nations. We strongly support their right to be independent, and we will observe their right to deal with their own problems independently. We believe that the national integrity of African states must be respected.</item>
                                <item>—However, we will distinguish between non-interference politically and the humanitarian obligation to help lessen human suffering.</item>
                                <item>—Finally, consulting our own interests, we will help our friends in Africa to help themselves when they are threatened by outside forces attempting to subvert their independent development. It is an-other lesson of the 1960ʼs, however, that African defense against subversion, like African development, <pb n="8" xml:id="d7-08" facs="d7-08"/>must be borne most directly by Africans rather than by outsiders.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Southern Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third challenge facing Africa is the deep-seated tension in the southern sixth of the Continent.</p>
                        <p>Clearly there is no question of the United States condoning, or acquiescing in, the racial policies of the white-ruled regimes. For moral as well as historical reasons, the United States stands firmly for the principles of racial equality and self-determination.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the 1960ʼs have shown all of us—Africa and her friends alike—that the racial problems in the southern region of the Continent will not be solved quickly. These tensions are deeply rooted in the history of the region, and thus in the psychology of both black and white.</p>
                        <p>These problems must be solved. But there remains a real issue in how best to achieve their resolution. Though we abhor the racial policies of the white regimes, we cannot agree that progressive change in Southern Africa is furthered by force. The history of the area shows all too starkly that violence and the counter-violence it inevitably provokes will only make more difficult the task of those on both sides working for progress on the racial question.</p>
                        <p>The United States warmly welcomes, therefore, the recent Lusaka Manifesto, a declaration by African leaders calling for a peaceful settlement of the tensions in Southern Africa. That statesmanlike document combines a commitment to human dignity with a perceptive understanding of the depth and complexity of the racial problem in the area--a combination which we hope will guide the policies of Africa and her friends as they seek practical policies to deal with this anguishing question.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d7-09" facs="d7-09"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>American policy toward Africa, then, will illustrate our general approach to building an enduring peace. Our stake in the Continent will not rest on todayʼs crisis, on political maneuvering for passing advantage, or on the strategic priority we assign it. Our goal is to help sustain the process by which Africa will gradually realize economic progress to match its aspirations.</p>
                        <p>We must understand, however, that this process is only beginning. Its specific course is unclear. Its success depends in part on how we and the Africans move now in the climate as well as the substance of our relations.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—Africaʼs friends must find a new tone of candor in their essential dialogue with the Continent. All too often over the past decade the United States and others have been guilty of telling proud young nations, in misguided condescension, only what we thought they wanted to hear. But I know from many talks with Africans, including two trips to the Continent in 1957 and 1967, that Africaʼs new leaders are pragmatic and practical as well as proud, realistic as well as idealistic. It will be a test of diplomacy for all concerned to face squarely common problems and differences of view. The United States will do all it can to establish this new dialogue.</item>
                            <item>—Most important, there must be new and broader forms of mobilizing the external resources for African development. The pattern of the multilateral consortium which in the past few years has aided Ghana should be employed more widely else-where. This will require the closest cooperation between the Africans and those who assist them. <pb n="10" xml:id="d7-10" facs="d7-10"/>There is much to be gained also if we and others can help devise ways in which the more developed African states can share their resources with their African neighbors.</item>
                            <item>
                                <p>—The United States is firmly committed to non-interference in the Continent, but Africaʼs future depends also on the restraint of other great powers. No one should seek advantage from Africaʼs need for assistance, or from future instability. In his speech on February 12, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> affirmed that:</p>
                                <p>“We have deep respect for the independence of the African nations. We are not involved in their internal affairs. We want our relations with them to be on a basis of mutual respect, mutual trust and equality. We have no desire for any domination of any country or any area and have no desire for any special influence in Africa, except the influences that naturally and mutually develop among friends.”</p>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Africa of the 1970ʼs will need schools rather than sympathy, roads rather than rhetoric, farms rather than formulas, local development rather than lengthy sermons. We will do what we can in a spirit of constructive cooperation rather than by vague declarations of good will. The hard facts must be faced by Africans and their friends; and the hard work in every corner of the Continent must be done. A durable peace cannot De built if the nations of Africa are not true partners in the gathering prosperity and security which fortify that peace.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Liberia</hi>ʼs Tubman also warned of the possible spread of communism in Africa to the detriment of the West.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, <hi rend="underline">Zambia</hi>ʼs <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> in <hi rend="underline">Nigeria</hi> were aware of the dangers of dealing with the Chinese and the Soviets but generally discounted the impact of the Communists on the political fabric of their countries and on the continent.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>All evidenced a strong desire for more U.S. assistance preferably bilateral and with as few strings as possible. All recognized the great need for development and the related need for an improved climate for foreign investment. Specific requests for bilateral assistance are noted in the enclosed country summaries. Bilateral issues for each country are summarized at Tab B.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Most expressed some concern for U.S. policy toward the White Regimes but emphasis varied. The subject was only lightly touched upon in Ethiopia, Kenya and Congo(K). In Zambia and Ghana we were asked to take a more positive stance against the racial and colonial policies of the White States. <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Secretary General Telli pressed hard on this point. CAMEROON urged a stronger stand in support of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction over South West Africa. Our own Ambassadors, who were meeting in Kinshasa, want us to maintain moral and political pressures on the racial situation in Southern Africa.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Morocco and Tunisia</hi>. In both countries the Secretary en-countered what is becoming a common North African view of the Arab-Israeli problem -- that there will not be a settlement until Israel and the Palestinians come to terms with each other. This has long been President Bourguibaʼs sincerely held view, but King Hassan may have adopted it as a convenient way of bowing to the Palestinian cause while extricating himself from unqualified backing for Nasser. Since you will be talking with Hassan in July, you may be interested to ask the Secretary his view on how deeply held a position this is in Hassanʼs mind.</p>
                        <p>Having expressed an interest in pursuing further the concept of a Mediterranean policy, you might also be interested to ask the Secretaryʼs view on whether North African leaders look more to their African or their Mediterranean relationships.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> conveyed the respects of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. He added that he had yesterday also received a message instructing him to convey to Houphouet the personal best wishes of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his appreciation for Houphouetʼs counsel and his efforts to alleviate suffering during the Nigerian war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> then read in translation the text of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>ʼs oral message (State 026971). President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had also asked him to report back on Houphouetʼs impressions and advice concerning future U.S. relations with Africa. After stressing the historical and political significance of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ visit to Africa, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> regretted that the need to return to Washington for the Pompidou visit had prevented him from stopping off in Ivory Coast. He had sent Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> to Abidjan expressly to transmit to the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> the views of the USG.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Houphouet hoped that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> visit would serve to make even closer the excellent relations existing between Ivory Coast and the U.S. Ivory Coast remains attached to principles which had guided its course since independence. It was leaving the colonial era behind by dint of hard work directed to its own legitimate interests. There had to be cooperation; even so great a power as the U.S. could not do without the cooperation of small countries such as Ivory Coast. Technical assistance and economic and financial aid from developed countries was needed. Houphouet recalled that he had told President <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> that Ivory Coast did not want to remain an oasis of prosperity, for such an oasis would not be viable. It is beside the point to pretend to view the problems of developing <pb n="2" xml:id="d9-02" facs="d9-02"/>countries solely in terms of their internal difficulties; account must be taken of the youth and naivety of young countries. But even little countries are “citizens of the world,” and aware that their own security and prosperity would be endangered by a world at war even if the little countries themselves might not be directly involved. For this reason Ivory Coast was very attached to world peace.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Houphouet then said that what set him apart from other African leaders was his concern over the future. He attached great importance to the role of U.S. policy in Africa and elsewhere in the world. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> does not want to be the worldʼs policeman, but unfortunately we are not at the stage where we can dispense with policemen. The U.S. has a certain position in the world today and it cannot escape its responsibilities. What was most to be feared in Africa today was the spread of Communism. He had told De Gaulle that he understood his desire to achieve detente with the Soviets but that Africans remained skeptical of the wisdom of following such a course themselves. He had therefore told De Gaulle that Ivory Coast would not follow French lead in recognizing Peking, and he (Houphouet) had actively lobbied with other African leaders to that end. The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and North Koreans were now in Paris; but Taipei and Seoul were represented in Abidjan.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">History confirmed that the West had misjudged the Soviet threat ever since the October Revolution, Since World War II the Communists have gained ground everywhere. Communism remains the number one danger today. This is why the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> approves U.S. action in Viet Nam, and the only reproach it might make is that the U.S. did not intervene there soon enough. The big powers should have ensured respect of the partition of Palestine. They should have realized early on--as did the British and French at least at the time of Suez--the threat that Nasser posed. (“Nasser,” remarked Houphouet,”is the only head of state whose prestige grows with each defeat.”)</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">It was not Southeast Asia but the Middle East that today posed the greatest threat to world peace. It was once pretended that Communism had no chance to gain a foothold in the Middle East. But today the Communists are in Egypt (which had been the first African country to imprison Communists, Houphouet commented wryly). It had also been said that Communism could not catch hold and hence was not a danger in tropical Africa; but today the Communists were in Congo(B), Burundi, the <gloss target="#t_CAR1">CAR</gloss> and Guinea. “The giant canʼt see the ant at his feet, but the child can,” he said.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d9-03" facs="d9-03"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">We are today witnessing, continued Houphouet, a long, slow obstinate Communist penetration of Africa. A Communist is a Communist, regardless of differences in method between the Soviets and the Chinese, though—who knows?--perhaps race will one day predominate over doctrine--the Soviets grouped with the whites, the Chinese with the blacks. Communist influence was fanning out from the UAR and footholds had been established along the African coast. Ivorian youth had wanted the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> to show its independence, and so the Soviets had been permitted to establish diplomatic representation in Abidjan. provided they did not interfere in Ivorian internal affairs. But the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> soon saw that the Soviets were up to their usual tricks and so they were summarily asked to leave. And they were not about to be admitted back, he said. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName>ʼs dream of detente with the Soviets is realized today, and Soviet ships cruise the Mediterranean. Everyone had said that Libya would not move to the left; it has. Ethiopia was encircled by Communist subversion in the UAR, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, and Eritrea ʼwas a weak point within.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">“Non-alignment” was not a policy for the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss>. It was not by putting Odinga in to prison that Kenyaʼs problems could be solved. Houphouet said that he was on close terms with Nyerere but had told him frankly that he could not understand his policy towards Communist China and hoped that Nyerere did not underestimate the threat. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> cooperation on the TanZam railroad project troubles the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss>. The railroad would be uneconomical; Zambian copper could be shipped more cheaply via Kinshasa, which is also more convenient for the buyers. In plugging the “peaceful co-existence” line the Communists think that time is on their side and others will be lulled into complacency: “Communism has been fought since the end of World War II, but the Soviets havenʼt lost a single man.”</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This, said Houphouet, was why he had intervened in the Nigerian question. He had been an old friend of Balewa and their positions had always been identical. A few months before Balewaʼs death Houphouet had asked him why he permitted a national communist party (the only legal one in Africa) when there was already so much poverty in northern Nigeria where Communist ideology could take root. Balewa had replied that he would be vigilant and in case of danger would an the party. Even then, said Houphouet, he (Houphouet) feared what might happen in Nigeria because of Soviet influence. Later he had asked Tubman to go talk sense into the Nigerians. Tubman said that he had sent his Ambassador to Lagos three weeks previously but Gowen would not receive him. Then the Nigerian government announced that the country would be divided into twelve regions--<pb n="4" xml:id="d9-04" facs="d9-04"/>one region for the Ibos and eleven regions for the 249 other Nigerian tribes. Fighting broke out. Gowon sent an emissary to Abidjan and to Monrovia to assure that only a simple police action was underway in Nigeria. “I didnʼt even know Ojukwu then,” said Houphouet, Indeed, more than ten months afterwards arms for Gowon were moving through Ivory Coast: from the port at Abidjan they went by railroad to Ouagadougou and then on to Niamey for final shipment to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">During this time the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> had sought ways to end the war, and thought that it could be achieved by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention in much the same way that this had been brought about in Cyprus. Then Houphouet had received a telegram from Senghor, commending to him the former President of. Nigeria, Azikiwe, who had eloquently pleaded the cause of Biafra and urged its recognition. He had spoken of genocide; “I hadnʼt heard of this before,” said Houphouet. Houphouet had responded to Azikiwe that if he recognized Biafra everyone would think that it was for reasons of francophone versus anglophone politics. Azikiwe argued that recognition would be a means of bringing in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> expeditionary force. Nyerere arrived in Abidjan on his state visit (February 1968). <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> too said that some way had to be found to bring the Nigerian question before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. When <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> decided to recognize Biafra, he asked the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> to follow suit. But other African leaders--Mobuto, Ahidjo, for example--did not go along, for they saw the Nigerian conflict in terms of their own internal problems. They could not have acted differently and this did not bother us, said Houphouet.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">What did bother was the worsening of the problem in Nigeria because of the Soviet presence. The Soviets had <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>ʼs and heavy artillery pieces; why didnʼt they give them to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> three years earlier? Because it was in the Sovietsʼ interest for the war to fester and to be prolonged. If the Soviets established a foothold in Nigeria, the Africans would work with the Communist Chinese, said Houphouet. “After all, the Soviets are white, and we were the slaves of the whites.” Hence, if the West continues to remain indifferent it is not the Soviets but the Communist Chinese who will win out in the long run. And the West will be surprised, just as it was in Europe. What basis is there for any different appreciation of the problem in Africa today? The West has displayed inexcusable indifference. The West has force and unity, but in peacetime &amp; its thrust is diffusive. One mustnʼt take desire for reality. It is all very well for the USG now to say that it does not want to engage in ideological competition in Africa and to see problems there in terms of the East-West conflict; but it takes two to renounce competition.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d9-05" facs="d9-05"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Houphouet then turned to the problem of South Africa. It is, ho said, an internal problem that the people of South Africa must resolve. Apartheid was wrong. But other Africans could not change it by force. The other African states should help South Africa rethink the whole problem, for it is not a social or economic problem there but a human one and it will take time to solve. Black African states must avoid the fanaticism which has seized the Arab mind, and which the Soviets are now exploiting. “Our Arab brothers offer us for use against South Africa the legions which they canʼt muster to send against Israel.” The whites of South Africa are superior technicians. Africaʼs problem today is economic development and the promotion of better material well-being. Why should black Africans involve themselves in a struggle against Portugal or South Africa, thus squandering resources that could better be used for their own economic development? Tomorrow the cleavage in Africa will be between those who are for and those who are against Communism. Those Africans who oppose Communism might one day regret that they donʼt have the whites of South Africa on their side.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Use of force to correct conditions in Southwest Africa was a comedy that black Africa could ill afford. In the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Ivory Coast refuses to condemn South Africa; the reason was not that the <gloss target="#t_GOIC1">GOIC</gloss> approves of South African policy but rather that condemnation itself is a poor policy. Africans, mused Houphouet, are prone to see the effect and never the cause; if one goes to the cause one can better understand the problem. So in condemning South Africa, these black Africans forget that Africans have sold one another as slaves and other Africans were buyers. They forget that there are also castes in black African society. A leading figure in the Senegalese Government is the son of a blacksmith, which in their tribal society is very low caste; as a result, some notables have objected to having to associate with him. No, said Houphouet, outsiders cannot pretend to be able to solve South Africaʼs race problems any more than they can substitute themselves for the American people in solving civil rights problems in the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> thanked Houphouet for his views. He said that while there might be some points of nuance on which US policy differed, in the main he thought that U.S. and Ivory Coast views on these important issues were much alike. On the question of the Communist threat, he stressed that the U.S. was not unaware of Communist activities in Africa but considered that it was important to view the problem in each country in terms of the local situation and needs. In the specific case of Nigeria, he warned against <pb n="6" xml:id="d9-06" facs="d9-06"/>being deceived by the present tone of the Nigerian press. It did not necessarily reflect the considered views of the Nigerian Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> recalled that he had been in Lagos when the war ended. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> had told him at that time that he was well aware of the Soviet threat and would not be taken in by it.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">(At the conclusion of the meeting, the group retired to the Presidentʼs official residence nearby for luncheon, where they were joined by Philippe Yace, President of the National Assembly; Mamadou Coulibaly, President of the Economic and Social Council; and Alphonse Boni, President of the Supreme Court.)</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">After a great deal of consideration of our performance during the first year, I have decided that our greatest weakness was in spreading my time too thin -- not emphasizing priorities enough. This may sound strange in view of the fact that I did arrange my time to do the November 3rd speech and the State of the Union adequately; but the balance of this memorandum will demonstrate what I want implemented for the future. Also, while this applies primarily to my time, I want <persName corresp="#p_EJD1">Ehrlichman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to apply the same rules to allocating their time to the extent that they find it possible.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">What really matters in campaigns, wars or in government is to concentrate on the big battles and win them. I know the point of view which says that unless you fight all the little battles too that you do not lay the ground work for winning the big ones. I do not agree with this point of view to the extent that it means that I will have to devote any significant part of my time to the lower priority items, or to the extent that <persName corresp="#p_EJD1">Ehrlichman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> have to do so.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This means that there must be delegation to the Departments and within the White House staff of complete responsibility for those matters which are not going to have any major effect on our success as an Administration.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Applying this general rule to specifics, in the field of Foreign Policy, in the future all that I want brought to my attention are the following items.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Policy toward Western Europe, but only where NATO is affected and where major countries (Britain, Germany and France) are affected. The only minor countries in Europe which I want to pay attention to in the foreseeable future will be Spain, Italy, and Greece. I do not want to see any papers on any of the other countries, unless their problems are directly related to NATO. At the next level out where I am indicating policy toward the Mid-East and then finally in the last is policy with regard to Vietnam and anything that relates to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, etc. As far as the balance of Asia is concerned, that part of Africa which is not directly related to the Mid-East crisis, and all of Latin America and all countries in the Western Hemisphere with the exception of Cuba and anything else that may be concerned with the East-West conflict, I do not want matters submitted to me unless they require Presidential decision and can only be handled at the Presidential level.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This is going to require a subtle handling on <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>ʼs part. He must not let members of his staff or members of the establishment and the various Departments think that I do not care about the under-developed world. I do care, but what happens in those parts of the world is not, in the final analysis, going to have any significant effect on the success of our foreign policy in the foreseeable future. The thing to do here is to farm out as much of the decision-making in those areas to the Departments, and where <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> does not have and the various Departments think that I “do not care” about the confidence that State will follow up directives that I have previously laid down with regard to Latin America, Africa and the under-developed countries of Asia, he should farm that subject out to a member of his staff but he, himself, should not bother with it. I want him to concentrate just as hard as I will be concentrating on these major countries and these major problem areas.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">In the future, all that I want to see with regard to what I consider the lower priority items would be a semiannual report indicating what has happened; and where a news conference is scheduled, of course, just enough information so that I can respond to a question, although it is interesting to note that we have received very few questions on the <pb n="3" xml:id="d10-03" facs="d10-03"/>low priority items in news conferences to date.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName>, in the arranging of my schedule, have in mind these priorities. Great pressures will build up to see this and that minor or major officials from the low priority countries. All of this is to be farmed out to Agnew. For example, the Minister of Mines from Venezuela is a case in point; he should not have been included on the schedule, and I do not want this to happen again.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>We have prepared and are submitting for your approval the attached statement on our policies in Africa. This is the first full statement of this kind by the United States Government in recent years. It represents, as you know, the results of numerous discussions with African leaders, a reflection of your own observations and interests regarding the continent, and conclusions arising from my own recent tour of Africa. It reflects with greater detail the principles of our African policy set forth in the Report on Foreign Policy in the 1970ʼs.</p>
                        <p>The report emphasizes elements of our relationship to Africa both economic and political which will be of special importance in the coming months.</p>
                        <p>We believe the actions and objectives set forth in this paper represent a positive program within current budgetary and legislative guidelines. We have not suggested precise levels for the economic programs in view of the current studies of the world-wide foreign assistance policy. We feel it important, however, that our programs be certainly not less than the present level. We intend, within that level, to demonstrate herein how our current capabilities can respond more fully to Africaʼs stated needs.</p>
                        <p>In the ensuing weeks we shall be discussing aspects of the program with members of the Congress. We shall <pb n="2" xml:id="d11-02" facs="d11-02"/>be developing other aspects in direct consultation with African governments, governments of other countries participating in African development and significant regional and international institutions.</p>
                        <p>As time goes on, we shall be building on this foundation, expanding where we can to increase the total effectiveness of our relationship with this significant continent. I believe you will find in our approach the basis for the positive expression of U.S. interest in Africa which you have so strongly encouraged.</p>
                        <p rend="right">Respecfully yours,</p>

                                <hi rend="underline">U. S. AND AFRICA IN THE 70ʼS</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">A. <hi rend="underline">Africa and the U.S.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>Africa, for many reasons, deserves the active attention and support of the United States. It is in our national interest to cooperate with African countries in their endeavors to improve conditions of life and to help in their efforts to build an equitable political and economic order in which all can effectively share.</p>
                            <p>The energy and talent of the peoples of Africa represent a significant force in world development and world trade. It is a continent of impressive opportunities for future growth and development--one destined to play an increasingly important role in the world. Africans have taken much of their political inspiration from the United States. Their thousands of students in the United States today--and the many Americans studying and teaching in Africa--continue the tradition of this exchange. More than a few Africans who studied in America became leaders of independence of their countries.</p>
                            <p>Many of our ties to Africa have been longstanding. The Sultan of Morocco recognized our own independence at an early date and exchanged diplomatic correspondence with George Washington. The oldest American treaty which has been continuously in force was signed with Morocco in 1787. We <pb n="4" xml:id="d11-04" facs="d11-04"/>signed a similar treaty with Tunisia in 1797. Close U.S. ties to Liberia date from 1816 and with Ethiopia from 1903. And Americans have long identified themselves with the pursuit of independence and freedom in Africa, as elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>Africa is growing closer to the United States. Communications with Africa are rapidly developing, and communication links with other continents through Intelsat are now in operation and more African earth stations are being constructed. Two major American airlines serve the continent. Overflight rights are important to our commerce and to our scientific efforts. We have important communications facilities in both West and East Africa. Our space and scientific programs rely on the cooperation of the peoples and governments of Africa.</p>
                            <p>The resources of Africa are products which we purchase substantially in international trade: rubber, petroleum, bauxite, timber, coffee, cocoa, minerals and precious stones, to name a few. They are important to the Africans as a primary source of their wealth.</p>
                            <p>Americaʼs links with the peoples of Africa have been extensive. Missionaries have established schools and hospitals throughout the continent and have lived and worked in Africa many years before official relations were established. We have <pb n="5" xml:id="d11-05" facs="d11-05"/>demonstrated humanitarian concern for the people of the continent in our provision of help and relief in countless ways.</p>
                            <p>And, finally, we are linked by the cultural fact that one out of every ten Americans has his origins in Africa.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">B. <hi rend="underline">What We Seek</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>We seek a relationship of constructive cooperation with the nations of Africa--a cooperative and equal relationship with all who wish it. We are prepared to have diplomatic relations under conditions of mutual respect withʼ all the nations of the continent. We want no military allies, no spheres of influence, no big power competition in Africa. Our policy is a policy related to African countries and not a policy based upon our relations with non-African countries.</p>
                            <p>As early as 1957, when he returned from a mission to Africa on behalf of President Eisenhower, the then Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> recommended that the U.S. assign a higher priority to our relations with an Africa, which he recognized to be of growing importance to the United States. Specifically he said:</p>
                            <p>“The United States must come to know these leaders better, to understand their hopes and aspirations, and to support them in their plans and programs for strengthening their own nations <pb n="6" xml:id="d11-06" facs="d11-06"/>and contributing to world peace and stability. To this end, we must encourage the greatest possible interchange of persons and ideas with the leaders and peoples of these countries. We must assure the strongest possible diplomatic and consular representation to those countries and stand ready to consult these countries on all matters affecting their interests and ours.”</p>
                            <p>Personal relationships between members of the Administration and African leaders have been widely expanded. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met leaders from 10 African countries during the past year. I met a number of African leaders during 1969 and in the fall met and discussed common issues with 26 African Foreign Ministers at the United Nations General Assembly. The meetings included and contributed to closer understanding even with states with which we have no current diplomatic relations; in the case of Mauritania the discussion with the Foreign Minister in New York was the first step toward a resumption of relations which has now taken place. In February I became the first Secretary of State to tour Africa. I visited 10 African countries. I also spoke with leaders of the Organization of African Unity, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Economic Commission for Africa and other regional bodies. I met in Kinshasa with the American chiefs <pb n="7" xml:id="d11-07" facs="d11-07"/>of mission and principal officers from the African countries in which we are represented.</p>
                            <p>It is through open and honest exchanges such as these that we can better understand the needs and aspirations of the peoples and governments of Africa and they can learn of the objectives and problems we Americans face at this time and place in history.</p>
                            <p>Some of my countrymen used to long for the luxury of isolation behind the protection of two great oceans. But the time for that has passed. The continental size of the United States, its vast productive power, its technological capabilities, its interdependence with other parts of this planet impel us into active participation in world affairs.</p>
                            <p>But in this participation we do not seek any kind of domination. We seek with all nations the closest relationship which is mutually acceptable and beneficial, but seek it with full respect for diversity among nations.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">C. <hi rend="underline">What Africans Seek</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>An effective relationship with Africa depends on an under-standing of Africa and its needs. We have sought in our discussions and visits with African leaders and African peoples to determine how they define these needs.</p>
                            <pb n="8" xml:id="d11-08" facs="d11-08"/>
                            <p>They have spoken to us first of their strong desire to satisfy the aspirations of their people for a better life. They want to do this through economic cooperation. They want economic assistance now to make themselves less dependent later on foreign resources. They look to trade as a more equitable relationship than aid. They want investment in which they are partners.</p>
                            <p>After decades of being governed from afar, they want respect for human dignity. They want to abolish discrimination. They want equality throughout the continent.</p>
                            <p>They want self-determination throughout the continent. They want respect for the independence of the new nations and for their sovereignty. They welcome cooperation with other nations but they do not want intervention.</p>
                            <p>They want to build political and social institutions based on their own cultural patterns. They want to adapt ideas from abroad to their own psychology and spirit.</p>
                            <p>They want respect for the boundaries of Africa and security for each nation within these boundaries. They want recognition that, within its infinite diversity, Africa has a cohesion and a unity of its own, such as represented by the Organization of African Unity.</p>
                            <pb n="9" xml:id="d11-09" facs="d11-09"/>
                            <p rend="flushleft">D. <hi rend="underline">The U.S. Response</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The United States desires to be responsive to Africa, even though there are limitations on our capacities and our resources.</p>
                            <p>We desire economic relations on a basis of mutual benefit and respect. Recognizing the need for capital and technical assistance, the United States directly and in cooperation with others will continue to help. The U.S. will pursue more active programs of trade and private investment, with full recognition of African sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>We will continue to support wider cooperation on a regional and continental basis among African counties.</p>
                            <p>The United States will continue to stand for racial equality and self-determination looking for peaceful and evolutionary solutions to advance these goals. We will help to provide economic alternatives for the small independent states in southern Africa.</p>
                            <p>We will avoid supplying arms in southern Africa, and we will persist in our support for self-determination.</p>
                            <p>We will respect the institutions which the African them-selves create. While we in this country have a preference for democratic procedures, we recognize. that the forces for change and nation-building which operate in Africa may create <pb n="10" xml:id="d11-10" facs="d11-10"/>governmental patterns not necessarily consistent with such procedures.</p>
                            <p>We are impressed with the growing force of youth in Africa. In country after country, governments are headed by young leaders--each with constituencies made up overwhelmingly of people even younger than themselves. Leaders and led, they are to an impressive degree post-World War II men, all shaped by the forces of this era of rapid, unprecedented change.</p>
                            <p>The opportunities for progress, and the prospects for difficulties, are immense: More educated, more aware, more confident, more competent than any African generation before, tie youth of that continent cannot help but exert a restless pressure for change, for greater opportunity to improve their lives.</p>
                            <p>Their percentage of the population is enormous and growing. Today, 45 percent of Africaʼs population is 15 years old or younger. But it is not through strength of numbers alone that these youths will change the face of the continent. All of us are conscious of the vastly changing nature of our times, but for Africa perhaps even more than for the rest of the world, one era ended and another began while this generation was growing up. The city attracts the villager; school and university challenge ancient customs and ritual; the transistor radio <pb n="11" xml:id="d11-11" facs="d11-11"/>brings the farthest points of the world instantly to the smallest village. Better trained in modern techniques and modern concepts than previous generations, todayʼs young African will be the key to progress.</p>
                            <p>United States policies and programs in Africa will be affected by the force of youth and its potential for the future of the continent. As we review and try to strengthen our educational exchange, our technical training and assistance programs, and our Peace Corps support, we shall give special attention to programs to cooperate with these youths in preparation for their present and future responsibilities.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">E. <hi rend="underline">Economic Assistance Policy</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>An American economic assistance program in Africa is in United States national interests. We wish to see African countries develop and take their rightful place in cooperative international efforts to resolve worldwide problems. The drive and determination to develop must come from the African countries themselves. But at this point in their development, when per capita annual incomes average about $135, most of these countries need substantial external assistance to achieve rates of progress responsive to the minimum aspirations of their more than 300 million people for a better life. Our principal concern, therefore, is how most effectively to make capital assistance and technical knowledge from the developing <pb n="12" xml:id="d11-12" facs="d11-12"/>nations available to these developing nations.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the wave of independence swept through Africa in the late ʼ50ʼs and early ʼ60ʼs, Western European nations and multi-donor organizations have provided 60 to 70 percent of economic assistance to Africa. Because of their strong traditional and historic links to Africa, we hope the European nations will continue to provide the bulk of foreign assistance to Africa. But the United States also has deep and special ties to Africa. We should do our fair share in support of the independence and growth of African nations.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">F. <hi rend="underline">U.S. Assistance</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The total U.S. share has, in fact, averaged about $350 million a year for the past several years. This is about 20 percent of all external assistance to Africa. We intend to maintain a substantial contribution, hopefully with a larger share in economic development programs.</p>
                            <p>Our bilateral assistance program has included resources from A.I.D., PL-480, the Export-Import Bank and the Peace Corps. In the form of loans, grants and personnel, it has reached some thirty-five African countries. It has assisted national development programs, as veil as regional projects. We have worked through regional organizations, and jointly with other donors. The United States will continue to provide assistance to those nations which have been givenʼ emphasis in <pb n="13" xml:id="d11-13" facs="d11-13"/>the past. At the same time, mindful of needs throughout the continent, we have decided to make our approach to African assistance more flexible than it has recently been:

                                    <item>--We are actively studying the requirement that U.S. loans to Africa be used almost exclusively for the purchase of American goods and services.</item>

                            </p>
                            <p>We intend to provide more assistance to Africa through international institutions and multi-donor arrangements. We contribute 40 percent of the budget of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Development Program; 40 percent of its program is now being directed to Africa. We also contribute 40 percent of the budget of the International Development Association; in the past year its loans to Africa have risen substantially to twenty percent of all its loans, and the prospect is that this proportion will continue to rise.</p>
                            <p>We are seeking a substantial increase in the absolute amount of United States contributions to these institutions. The United States is now engaged in discussions with other-members of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>, under the leadership of the World Bank, which we hope will lead to larger contributions by all donor members of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. We have proposed to Congress an increased contribution to <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>In addition to our participation in international organizations, we are working more closely with other donors in World Bank and <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> sponsored consultative groups for several African countries, and in projects involving several donors. With limited total aid resources, we believe these mechanisms greatly <pb n="15" xml:id="d11-15" facs="d11-15"/>increase the effectiveness of foreign aid.</p>
                            <p>We also look forward to joining with other non-African donors in support of the African Development Bank. This young institution, which has the financial backing of thirty-one African governments, has prospects for promoting significant pan-African cooperation in economic progress. It has already raised $67 million from its members in fully convertible currencies. It needs, however, a source of funds that could be loaned to its members on concessional terms. We are participating in discussions with other non-African donors which we hope will lead to the creation of special funds for this purpose. In the meantime, we are assisting the Bank directly in its efforts to develop and carry out urgently needed projects in its member countries.</p>
                            <p>An important portion of our assistance to Africa supports regional projects and regional institutions. In Addis Ababa, in the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, one sees one of the most successful forms of international economic cooperation. Any serious appraisal of the development prospects in Africa makes clear the need for much greater regional cooperation. Many African nations are small; their national boundaries <pb n="16" xml:id="d11-16" facs="d11-16"/>frequently split natural economic regions. Most national markets are too small to support industry using modern technology. Africans have already demonstrated their recognition of the need for regional cooperation by establishing regional educational, technical and research institutes, economic communities, common markets, common financial arrangements and even common currencies. We hope to remain in the forefront of cooperative efforts to foster regional cooperation in Africa.</p>
                            <p>Our Food for Peace programs have been a major means of economic assistance in many African countries, through credit sales, food-for-work, donations and emergency relief efforts. In the past few years, forty percent of our aid to Africa has taken these forms. We will maintain this assistance wherever food aid can make an important contribution to economic development or help meet serious emergencies.</p>
                            <p>The Peace Corps conducts programs in twenty-three African countries. This, too, will be continued as long as African governments find the Peace Corpsʼ efforts useful <pb n="17" xml:id="d11-17" facs="d11-17"/>to them. The Peace Corps is seeking to intensify its recruitment of experienced and highly qualified personnel in order to emphasize technically oriented positions needed in development efforts. The Peace Corps is also moving ahead to make qualified volunteers available to international organizations working in the development field.</p>
                            <p>In our programs for youth, we shall intensify our efforts to establish personal relationships between African and American young political leaders, technicians, students and businessmen.</p>
                            <p>We shall expand inter-African scholarships and third-country training programs for youth within Africa, while maintaining traditional exchanges with the United States.</p>
                            <p>We shall encourage more of our own countryʼs diverse public and private groups to learn about and from Africans.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>We shall encourage the greater utilization of American citizens from the private sector to meet development needs in Africa. The International Executive Service Corps, <pb n="18" xml:id="d11-18" facs="d11-18"/>an American private organization which recruits American businessmen for short-term service in developing nations has pointed the way. This technique has already proven its usefulness in a number of countries as a means of offering American management experience to budding private industry and to government in African countries. We desire to see what can be done further to encourage this approach.</p>
                            <p>I have also called for a study of how the United States Government can establish a clearing house for requests from the more advanced developing nations for the provision of technical and professional services to meet scientific, technological and industrial requirements. Such a clearing house should be able to draw on both public and private personnel, and should have sufficient funds available where necessary to “top-off” salaries offered by these developing nations to foreign experts, so that the total earnings of the American specialists would continue to match their current value in the United States.</p>
                            <p>In these and other fashions we should like to share some of the positive aspects of our science, technology and management experience, as well as some of the lessons we have been learning from our own development. I have in mind not only our achievements in communications, industry and science, <pb n="19" xml:id="d11-19" facs="d11-19"/>but some of the grave by-products of these accomplishments, such as over-urbanization and pollution.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. Government recognizes the great potential of African labor to play a constructive role in the sound economic development of free and independent African nations. We have, therefore, consistently sought friendly understanding of the labor movements of African countries. We hope we can continue to make some significant contributions.</p>
                            <p>It is our policy to continue to support and encourage African governments in the development and execution of comprehensive labor manpower programs. And while recognizing African preferences for a distinctive African approach to trade union matters, we encourage close fraternal relations between the leaders and members of the African trade unions and Western national and international labor organizations.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">H. <hi rend="underline">Private Investment</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>There has been a steady growth in U.S. private investment in Africa since most of the African nations achieved their independence. By the end of 1968 the value of U.S. private investment in <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> member states was almost $2 billion. Between 1963 and 1968, U.S. private investment in Africa grew at an average annual rate of about fourteen percent.</p>
                            <p>We believe that private investment can and should play a growing role, above and beyond public assistance, in African <pb n="20" xml:id="d11-20" facs="d11-20"/>development. Africans themselves desire to participate in such investment. In many countries, in the face of limited capital resources, it is the government rather than the private sector which has the financial wherewithal to join with foreign private investors. Thus, “joint ventures” frequently involve a combination of foreign private and African governmental capital. We are prepared to encourage American investors to cooperate in such endeavors under adequate investment protection.</p>
                            <p>Our investment policy should be creative and flexible. It should be deeply concerned with the social environment in which it operates. When investing abroad, modern American businessmen offer training, profit-sharing and other opportunities. At the same time, as businessmen, they expect stability for the enterprises in which they join and a reasonable return on their investments. While the United States Government has guaranty programs available to many American investors, these are insurance and not the basis on which businessmen make investment. Thus, they pay great heed to African government programs to foster a favorable investment climate. Therefore, an investment code, assurances from the African government and reasonable entry, work and tax arrangements, can make the difference between an Americanʼs willingness or unwillingness to work out an investment.</p>
                            <pb n="21" xml:id="d11-21" facs="d11-21"/>
                            <p>Mineral and petroleum development account for nearly three-fourths of current U.S. private investment in Africa. The industry is exceptionally able to seek out new sources and new opportunities to meet growing demands.</p>
                            <p>The same is not the case, however, for investments in manufacturing, agro-business and commerce. Thus, we are already conducting certain programs to stimulate American private efforts in these fields.</p>
                            <list>
                                <item>--We have an increasingly successful, albeit modest, effort at getting American investors to look at integrated, large-unit agricultural schemes in Africa. In the past three years, American companies have made 27 preliminary studies, leading to ten in-depth studies and four investment commitments. Several more are currently being negotiated.</item>
                                <item>--We are also seeking to interest medium size American investors to look at opportunities to :yelp contribute to African markets, i.e., flour milling, bus transportation; and for meeting specialized markets which Africa could fill, such as plywood, shrimp fishing and food processing.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>Success in these and other programs depends on the already-mentioned favorable investment climate, on enterprises tailored to realistic market size, and ultimately on getting the prospective American investor to go to Africa to see for <pb n="22" xml:id="d11-22" facs="d11-22"/>himself what the conditions are and what his opportunity costs are.</p>
                            <p>The new Overseas Private Investment Corporation is authorized to provide guaranties, some equity, local currency loans and sound investment project advice to form the basis for a more efficient, flexible and aggressive approach to the promotion of U.S. investment in developing nations. It will be an important element in stimulating further American private investment in Africa.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">I. <hi rend="underline">Increased and Improved Trade Relations</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>I was deeply impressed on my recent trip by the great dependence of so many African countries on exports of one or two agricultural or mineral commodities. Sudden changes in world market prices for these commodities can cause violent fluctuations in export earnings and can disrupt development programs. In recognition of this instability the United States over the years has participated in international efforts to stabilize prices and incomes of primary products. We were one of the initial signatories of the International Coffee Agreement. The President is now recommending to the Congress renewal of the legislative authority for our continued adherence to this agreement. By the same token, we are continuing to participate in the <pb n="23" xml:id="d11-23" facs="d11-23"/>discussions within <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> working toward an international agreement on cocoa.</p>
                            <p>But the problem of prices affects other commodities as well. We have joined international efforts, such as those recently conducted at African initiative in the World Bank and <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, to see whether new and additional measures can be taken to stabilize prices and incomes.</p>
                            <p>Several months ago the President set forth proposals for generalized tariff preferences for all developing nations, so that they could more readily find markets for their manufactured and semi-manufactured products in the developed nations, including the United States. To this end, we are actively seeking agreement with other developed nations on some generalized preference scheme.</p>
                            <p>We are mindful of the special relationship which exists between some African and some European countries. Our purpose, however, is to give all developing nations much improved access for exports of their manufactures to the markets of all developed nations on an equal basis.</p>
                            <p>We are also urging the elimination of discriminatory tariffs--sometimes called “reverse preferences” -- which put our goods at a competitive disadvantage in many African markets. We hope that European nations see no linkage between eliminating the preferences they currently receive in some twenty African nations and their levels of aid to those countries.</p>
                            <pb n="24" xml:id="d11-24" facs="d11-24"/>
                            <p>In the meantime, we have been most encouraged to learn of the important first step taken by the member nations of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC), to reduce their general tariffs on most imported goods by fifty percent. They thus move closer to a non-discriminatory tariff position.</p>
                            <p>This measure offers the prospect of greater American trade with these countries.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">J. <hi rend="underline">The Problem of Southern Africa</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>One of the most critical political problems of continental concern relates to southern Africa. The problems of southern Africa are extremely stubborn. Passions are strong on both sides. We see no easy solutions.</p>
                            <p>Yet the modern world demands a community of nations based on respect for fundamental human rights. These are not only moral and legal principles; they are powerful and ultimately irresistible political and historical forces. We take our stand on the side of those forces of fundamental human rights in southern Africa as we do at home and elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>In Southern Rhodesia, we have closed our consulate. Our representatives in Salisbury were accredited to the Queen of England. When the Queenʼs authority was no longer recognized by the regime we withdrew our consulate. We <pb n="25" xml:id="d11-25" facs="d11-25"/>have also determined not to recognize the white-minority regime in Salisbury and will continue to support <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> economic sanctions.</p>
                            <p>To alleviate the difficulties of certain refugees in the United States, particularly of those from southern Africa, with respect to travel abroad, the United States expects in the near future to issue travel documentation as provided under the Protocol to the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees.</p>
                            <p>In the matter of Namibia (South West Africa), the United States has respected the international status of that territory since 1920. It has sought in the United Nations, before the International Court of Justice and in direct exchanges with South Africa, to defend that status. We have sought equally to defend the rights of the inhabitants, which that status was established to protect. <hi rend="underline">We are now participating in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> deliberations in this matter. Any further actions which the U.S. may take, in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or elsewhere, will continue to be consistent with our historic support of the law</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Our relations with the Republic of South Africa have been a matter of particular attention. We do not believe cutting our ties with this rich, troubled land would advance the cause we pursue or help the majority of the people of that country. We continue to make known to them and the world our strong views on apartheid. We are maintaining our arms embargo. <pb n="26" xml:id="d11-26" facs="d11-26"/>We oppose their continued administration of Namibia (South West Africa) and their implementation of apartheid and other repressive legislation there. We will continue to make clear that our limited governmental activities in South Africa do not represent any acceptance or condoning of its discriminatory system.</p>
                            <p>As for the Portuguese Territories, we shall continua to believe that their peoples should have the right of self-determination. We will encourage peaceful progress toward that goal. The declared Portuguese policy of racial toleration is an important factor in this equation. We think this holds genuine hope for the future. Believing that resort to force and violence is in no oneʼs interest, we imposed an embargo in 1961 against the shipment of arms for use in the Portuguese territories. We have maintained this embargo and will continue to do so.</p>
                            <p>The smaller independent states south of the Zambesi also deserve attention. They are seeking to create multi-racial societies free of the predominant influence of the minority-dominated states adjoining and surrounding them. They cannot exist without a realistic relationship with their neighbors. At the same time it is in the interest of all those who wish to see these states develop and prosper <pb n="27" xml:id="d11-27" facs="d11-27"/>to provide alternative sources of assistance and means of access to these states. This the United States, in cooperation with other donors, will seek to do. At the same time, the United States will seek to be responsive to requests from these states for a higher level of U.S. diplomatic representation.</p>
                            <p>In all these ways, as well as in positions taken in the United Nations and through diplomatic channels, we shall work to bring about a change of direction in parts of Africa where racial oppression and residual colonialism still prevail.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, we cannot accept the fatalistic view that only violence can ultimately resolve these issues. Rather we believe that solution lies in the constructive interplay of political, economic and social forces which will inevitably lead to changes.</p>

                            <p>As the President said in his Report to the Congress on Foreign Policy: “We want the Africans to build a better life for themselves and their children. We want to see an Africa free of poverty and disease, and free too of economic or political dependence on any outside power. And we want Africans to build this future as they think best, because in that way both our help and their efforts will be most relevant to their needs.”</p>

                        <p>PART V -BLACK AFRICA</p>
                        <p>35. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TITOʼS ESTIMATE OF SINO-SOVIET COMPETITION IN BLACK AFRICA. US KNOWS LITTLE OF STATE OF PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO SUPER-POWERS IN THIS AREA. WHICH DID TITO THINK WAS AHEAD?</p>
                        <p>36. TITO REPLIED THIS HARD TO SAY. IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT CHINA PRESENTLY TAKING FLEXIBLE AND SHREWD APPROACH, SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY, AND CAREFUL TO AVOID OFFENSE TO LOCAL PEOPLE. THEY WERE CONSTRUCTING A 1,000 KILOMETER RAILROAD FROM TANZANIA TO ZAMBIA; THEIR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE LIVING VERY MODESTLY. IT APPEARED TO BE CHINESE POLICY TO PROVIDE LARGE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND TO ASK LITTLE IN RETURN. LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF <pb n="3" xml:id="d13-03" facs="d13-03"/>THIS STRATEGY ARE LARGE. SOVIET INFLUENCE IS GREATER IN ARAB WORLD IN BLACK AFRICA IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE.</p>
                        <p>37. THE PRESIDENT RESPONDED THAT ON BASIS OF THESE COMMENTS HE WOULD CONCLUDE CHINESE POLICY MORE CLEVER AND SOPHISTICATED THAN WAS SOVIET. TITO COMMENTED CHINESE HAVE LEARNED LESSON FROM THEIR ON EARLIER EXPULSIONS. THEY PROFIT FROM PAST MISTAKES AND RECOGNIZE THAT AFRICANS HAVE HAD HAD EXPERIENCES AT HANDS FORMER COLONIAL POWERS AND HENCE WANT NO MORE OF SUCH DOMINATION. THEY WANT TO BE MASTERS OF THEIR OWN HOUSES AND WILL NOT TOLERATE INTERFERENCE IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS BY ANYONE. CHINESE MAY ALSO HAVE LEARNED FROM YUGOSLAV EXPERIENCE ON A MODEST SCALE. YUGOSLAVIA HAS SUPPLIED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO NUMBER AFRICAN COUNTRIES BUT HAS CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ANY KIND OF INTERFERENCE IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THEIR AID PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN EXPELLED ANYWHERE.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT ASKED TITO WHAT HE THOUGHT BLACK AFRICAN ATTITUDE WAS TOWARD US. DO AFRICANS CONSIDER US IMPERIALISTS, OR US ASSISTANCE A FORM OF NEO-COLONIALISM?</p>
                        <p>39. TITO ANSWERED THAT HIS IMPRESSION WAS THAT BLACK AFRICA IS CRITICAL OF US BECAUSE MOST OF ITS ASSISTANCE GOES TO SOUTHERN AFRICA AND US SEEMS TO SEEK CLOSER RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA AND PORTUGUESE COLONIES THAN WITH BLACK AFRICA. THEY WANT US ASSISTANCE BUT NOT AT EXPENSE OF INTERFERENCE IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS. (SECRETARY TEPAVAC INTERVENED TO SAY MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES EXPECT MUCH OF US DURING <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> SECOND DEVELOPMENT DECADE.) TITO CONTINUED THAT ONE SHOULDNʼT BE TOO IMPATIENT ABOUT RESULTS. CHANGING ATTITUDES THESE COUNTRIES IS LONG-TERM PROCESS. AID WITHOUT INTERFERENCE WILL END WELL. COUNTRY THAT GIVES ASSISTANCE NOT IN EGOISTIC WAY IN LONG RUN WILL HAVE GREATEST INFLUENCE. MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE AWARE THAT ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IS TOW-WAY PARTNERSHIP. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EVENTUALLY MEANS EQUAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS WHICH PROMOTES TRADE TO BENEFIT OF DONOR NATION.</p>
                        <p>40. TITO SAID IT IS ALSO QUITE UNWISE TO REGARD ANY POLITICAL CHANGE IN BLACK AFRICA AS MOVE TOWARDS SOCIALISM OR COMMUNISM. THESE COUNTRIES ARE QUITE FAR AWAY FROM COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM. THEY WISH MAKE REVOLUTION IN A CONSTRUCTIVE SENSE. THEY WILL DEAL WITH IDEOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS IN THEIR OWN WAYS, ADAPTING THEM TO THEIR NEEDS. <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">KAUNDA</persName> OF ZAMBIA THINKS THAT “HUMANISM” IS HIGHEST FORM OF PROGRESS. NYERERE OF TANZANIA IS GIFTED AND CAPABLE MAN WHO SEEKS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH ALL COUNTRIES. KENYATTA OF KENYA IS ANOTHER AFRICAN LEADER WHO BELIEVES IN PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THESE STATES DOESNʼT PAY VERY WELL AND RESULTS NEVER LAST VERY LONG. THEY ARE DETERMINED TO BE INDEPENDENT, BUT THEY REQUIRE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. CONCEPT OF GIVING ONE PERCENT OF NATIONAL INCOME TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAS <pb n="4" xml:id="d13-04" facs="d13-04"/>CAUGHT ON WITH SOME EUROPEAN STATES, AND THERE ARE BETTER PROSPECTS OF DEVELOPING MULTILATERAL FORMS OF ASSISTANCE. TITO NOTED THAT <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> HAS NOT YET SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN THESE PROPOSALS.</p>
                        <p>PART VI-ALGERIA</p>
                        <p>41. THE PRESIDENT ASKED TITO FOR HIS VIEWS ON THE ATTITUDES AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE PRESENT ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT, ADDING THAT DO NOT KNOW THOSE PEOPLE VERY WELL. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TITO THINK OF ALGERIAʼS ROLE IN WORLD AFFAIRS? IS ALGIERS, FOR INSTANCE, INTERESTED IN A LARGER ROLE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND, IF SO, HOW DID IT EXPECT TO PLAY SUCH A ROLE?</p>
                        <p>42. TITO SAID HE ENJOYED GOOD RELATIONS WITH BOUMEDIENE AS HE HAD WITH HIS PREDECESSOR, BEN BELLA. ALGERIA WAS MOST INTERESTED IN ITS OWN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN HIS EXTENSIVE TALKS WITH BOTH LEADERS THIS THREAD CONSISTENTLY RAN THROUGH THEIR CONVERSATIONS. ALGERIA ALSO WISHED TO CONSOLIDATE ITS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND, AS ONE OF THE LARGER POWERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, TO PLAY AN ACTIVE AND IMPORTANT ROLE IN THAT AREA. NO DOUBT THAT THERE WAS SOME FRICTION BETWEEN CAIRO AND ALGIERS. BOUMEDIENE IS A STRONG MAN BUT FLEXIBLE WITHIN THE POSSIBILITIES THAT OTHER ARAB POSITIONS ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY. HE DOES NOT HURRY TO TAKE POSITIONS AND AIS CONCERNED NOT TO LOSE THE PRESTIGE HE HAS. HE DOES NOT FAVOR SOVIET SIDE. ALTHOUGH ON OCCASION HE MAY APPEAR TO HAVE ADOPTED RIGID POSITIONS, YUGOSLAVS BELIEVE HE KNOWS HOW TO ADJUST HIMSELF TO CONCRETE SITUATIONS AND THAT HE WILL SHIFT ACCORDING TO REQUIREMENTS OF SITUATION.</p>

                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d14-02" facs="d14-02"/>
                        <p>“Our stake in the Continent will not rest on todayʼs crisis, on political maneuvering for passing advantage, or on the strategic priority we assign it. Our goal is to help sustain the process by which Africa will gradually realize economic progress to match its aspirations.”</p>
                        <p rend="right">U.S. Foreign Policy For The 1970ʼs Report to the Congress<lb/>February 18, 1970</p>
                        <p>Africa is a continental experiment in nation building. The excitement and enthusiasm of national birth have phased into the more sober period of growth.</p>
                        <p>Our historic ties with Africa are deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of many of our people. Our sympathy for Africaʼs newly independent states is a natural product of our traditional antipathy for colonialism. Our economic interests in the continent are substantial, and growing. And our responsibilities as a global power inevitably give us an interest in the stability and well-being of so large a part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Reflecting these close ties, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> last year became the first Secretary of State to visit Africa. His personal observations and experiences, in Morocco, <pb n="3" xml:id="d14-03" facs="d14-03"/>Tunisia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, the Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, and Liberia gave a new dimension at the highest level to our knowledge and understanding of Africa. A major result of that visit was the basic policy statement issued with my warm approval in March, 1970. In that statement Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> summarized our aim in Africa as “a relationship of constructive cooperation with the nations of Africa—a cooperative and equal relationship with all who wish it.”</p>
                        <p>We recognize that it is not for us to attempt to set the pattern of relationships among the states of Africa. Only the Africans can forge national unity. Those problems having to do with the building of stable national institutions are neither appropriate for, nor amenable to, much of a contribution from us. Only the Africans themselves can do such work.</p>
                        <p>The promise of the newly independent African nations is great. But they face all the normal problems associated with independence, and some special ones stemming from historic reliance on tribal organizations not always reflected in national boundaries drawn for the administrative convenience of the former colonial powers. Moreover, colonialism and racial injustice in southern Africa continue to frustrate the African sense of fulfillment.</p>
                        <p>These facts complicate the essential task of clothing new political institutions with authority. They make more difficult the problem of working out stable relationships among the nations of Africa, and between Africa and the rest of the world. They compound the exigent task of obtaining and applying the resources needed for economic development.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrineʼs encouragement of self-reliance has an immediate and broad applicability in Africa. Africa has depended less than other areas on American leadership and assistance, and its institutions and relationships were created without our providing either the impetus or the concept. In Africa, therefore, the <pb n="4" xml:id="d14-04" facs="d14-04"/>conflict between the application of our new doctrine and the requirements of continuity are minimal. To an unusual degree, our conception of the current realities is unencumbered by the weight of previous under- takings. Our freedom of decision is not constrained by the demands, legal or implicit, of past commitments and actions.</p>
                        <p>Within the framework of African efforts, however, there are three primary needs of the continent to which we can contribute. Africa seeks peace, economic development, and justice; and she seeks our assistance in reaching those goals. It is in our interest to respond as generously as our resources permit.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Peace</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The major contribution we can make to the peace of the continent is to support the African effort to keep free of great power rivalries and conflicts. Africaʼs unresolved problems should not be used as a pretext for non-Africans to intervene. African needs for assistance should not be manipulated to establish an undue outside influence. The nations of Africa need tranquility and a chance to resolve their own domestic and inter-African problems. Conflict and involvement in Cold War rivalries can only bring harm to Africa and tragic delay in its progress.</p>
                        <p>For that reason, we seek no positions in Africa which threaten the interests of others. Nor can we con-done activities by others which have that effect. There-fore, support for the inviolability of African borders and the integrity of African states is a cardinal point of American policy.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, our ability to adhere to this posture of restraint is dependent upon a similar posture by others. We believe that the African nations themselves are he best guarantors, as they are certainly the prime beneficiaries, of such restraint.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d14-05" facs="d14-05"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Development</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second great African need to which we can con-tribute is economic development. Africa must obtain material resources and technology from abroad. Multi-lateral and private investment channels are, we believe, the most efficient means to effect capital development. But external resources can bring real progress only if Africaʼs own human resources are developed and mobilized for this effort. It is in this area that we believe our bilateral assistance programs can be most effective. We therefore hope to contribute to Africaʼs economic development in four major ways:
<list>
                                <item>—Our bilateral assistance programs in the years ahead will concentrate on the development of human resources—on education, population problems, and agricultural skills. In the technical assistance field, we intend to send more highly trained technicians. This will be particularly evident in the “New Direction” of the Peace Corps programs in Africa.</item>
                                <item>—But aid alone is not sufficient. African countries also need new markets. Generalized tariff preferences will help to open new markets for their manufactured goods in the more industrialized countries. I will shortly submit legislation to authorize U.S. participation in this program. We will also continue to participate in international efforts to maintain and stabilize markets for traditional exports of primary products.</item>
                                <item>—We intend to use our influence in international lending and development agencies to encourage greater assistance to Africa. In this respect we applaud the decision of the World Bank to increase its assistance to Africa threefold.</item>
                                <item>—Finally, we will actively encourage private investment in the developing countries of Africa. Private investment is the easiest and most efficient way to transfer both resources and human skills <pb n="6" xml:id="d14-06" facs="d14-06"/>from a developed to a developing society. American investment in Africa now stands at about three billion dollars, of which more than two thirds is in the developing area. It has been growing annually at over 12%. We expect that a high rate will continue in coming years. In African countries favored with resources and wise leader- ship, I have no doubt that private investment will play a far more significant role than public aid in speeding their progress.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Justice</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third broad area in which Africans seek our assistance is the search for racial and political justice in southern Africa. There is perhaps no issue which has so pernicious a potential for the well-being of Africa and for American interests there. It is, for many, the sole issue by which our friendship for Africa is measured. I wish to review in all frankness our policy toward this grievous problem.</p>
                        <p>Both our statements and our actions have, or should have, made it patently clear to all concerned that racism is abhorrent to the American people, to my administration, and to me personally. We cannot be indifferent to apartheid. Nor can we ignore the tensions created in Africa by the denial of political self-determination. We shall do what we can to foster equal opportunity and free political expression instead. We shall do so on both moral and practical grounds, for in our view there is no other solution.</p>
                        <p>The United States has, therefore, reaffirmed and continued to enforce the embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa. When Southern Rhodesia attempted to sever formal ties with Britain, we closed our Consulate there. We have reaffirmed and continued to en-force the economic sanctions against Rhodesia, and we have sought ways to ensure a more universal compliance with those sanctions.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d14-07" facs="d14-07"/>
                        <p>The United States also has continued its embargo on the sale of arms for use in Portuguese African territories. In support of the United Nations effort to terminate South Africaʼs jurisdiction over South-West Africa, we have adopted a policy of discouraging American investment in that territory. We have sought to provide assistance and encouragement to Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland in their efforts to prove the viability of multiracial societies in the heart of southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>These measures define our policy toward the problems of southern Africa. We intend to continue these efforts, and to do what we can to encourage the white regimes to adopt more generous and more realistic policies toward the needs and aspirations of their black citizens.</p>
                        <p>However, just as we will not condone the violence to human dignity implicit in apartheid, we cannot associate ourselves with those who call for a violent solution to these problems.</p>
                        <p>We are convinced that the use of violence holds no promise as the solution to the problems of southern Africa. Neither the military nor the economic strength is available to force change on the white minority regimes. Violence would harden the resistance of the white minorities to evolutionary change. Resort to force would freeze the prejudice and fear which lie at the heart of the problem. Finally, violence would certainly hurt most the very people it would purport to serve.</p>
                        <p>The interests of the white regimes themselves surely dictate change. The United States believes that the outside world can and should use its contacts with southern Africa to promote and speed that change. We do not, therefore, believe the isolation of the white regimes serves African interests, or our own, or that of ultimate justice. A combination of contact and moral pressure serves all three.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d14-08" facs="d14-08"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Progress</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have dwelt at length on the problems of Africa because it is to them that our policies are of necessity addressed. But it is necessary also to recognize the progress which is taking place.</p>
                        <p>The return of peace to Nigeria was the paramount African event of 1970. That event was all the more welcome to us, for the American zeal to help reduce the anguishing human cost of that conflict led to some misunderstanding and strain in our relations with the Nigerian Government. The United States views with admiration the humane and statesmanlike policy of reconciliation which Nigeria has adopted. We ourselves know the suffering and bitterness which a civil war entails. Our country emerged stronger and more united. Nigeria, too, has emerged from the challenge stronger and united, and ready to assume the significant role in Africa which, her size, her resources, and her sixty million people dictate. That is a development of the highest significance for the future stability and well-being of Africa. We welcome it.</p>
                        <p>I should also mention the striking progress which has been made in the Democratic Republic of the Con-go. Five years of peace have transformed that country from perhaps the most tortured of African states to one of the most stable. This development vindicates the faith in a united Congo which the United States displayed in darker days. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs visit to Washington in August served to recall the support we extended to the Congo at that time, and to reaffirm the strong friendship between our two countries which has resulted.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor of Ethiopia, unique among world leaders in the length of his reign and his contribution to independent Africa, visited the United States in October. That occasion provided an opportunity for me to review with him the role of the United States in the economic progress of that ancient land, and to reaffirm <pb n="9" xml:id="d14-09" facs="d14-09"/>the close ties of cooperation between our two countries. Ethiopia has been a leader in Africaʼs creation of regional organizations. Their growing vitality is encouraging, and we hope that activities of this kind will serve increasingly as the focus for economic cooperation between African countries.

                        <p>The potential of Africa is great, but so are its problems. We view Africa with the strongest of goodwill, tempered by the sober recognition of the limits of the contribution which we can make to many of its problems. We look to African leadership to build the frame-work within which other nations, including the United States, can fully contribute to a bright African future. A peaceful, progressive, and just Africa is an exciting and worthy goal. We hope by our policies to facilitate economic progress in one part of Africa, human and social justice in the other, and peace in both.</p>

                            <item>After several years of neglect, Peking is showing a renewed interest in Black Africa. The Chinese are again offering aid, bidding for diplomatic recognition, and throwing lavish receptions for visiting African delegations. The current initiative suggests that Chinaʼs leaders attach considerable importance to their relations with Sub-Saharan Africa -- if not for its intrinsic worth (if you “win” Black Africa, what have you won?), then as a place where easy points can be made in pursuit of larger objectives lying outside Africa.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>One purpose of Chinese activity in Africa has been to affirm the regimeʼs revolutionary image at home and abroad. In Black Africa, Pekingʼs call for revolutionary struggle against colonialism and imperialism could be made credible with direct action: the arming and training of national liberation groups, <pb n="5" xml:id="d15-05" facs="d15-05"/>support to those new regimes deemed truly revolutionary, and aid to political dissidents in “reactionary” Black African states. Such a radical and uncompromising program distinguished Pekingʼs policy toward revolution from the more moderate “revisionist” line taken by Moscow. Initially the Chinese were supporting subversive action against some of the regimes that the Russians were courting, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Uganda, among others.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Closely related to Chinaʼs revolutionary self-image is its use of Black Africa as a safe and fruitful ground on which to arouse hostility toward the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Peking has consistently sought to identify these two powers as Africaʼs main enemies, together conspiring to prevent the total liberation of Africa. Chinaʼs African friends are urged to shake off their imperialist fetters, repulse American and Soviet attempts to subvert their revolutionary gains, and get on with the revolution. In addition the Chinese have challenged the Soviet model of economic development as being unsuited to African conditions. Pekingʼs leaders thus measure their success in Black Africa <pb n="6" xml:id="d15-06" facs="d15-06"/>partially in terms of US and Soviet reverses.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4" type="source">The Russians, who saw the Chinese preempt Soviet influence in Mali in the mid-1960s and lead the Keita regime on a radical and self-destructive course, acknowledge that Pekingʼs policies have undermined Soviet influence. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> condemns “Mao and his group” for pursuing irresponsible and adventurist policies. In particular they are charged with ignoring political and economic realities in individual states; with promoting indiscriminate African acceptance of the Chinese model; and with setting Africa against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the rest of the socialist camp.</note> When a US firm is nationalized, or when an African leader adopts Maoist slogans, it brings joy to the Peopleʼs Palace; for these are seen as small but significant gains in a protracted struggle to reduce the global clout of the two super powers and to bring to China the international respect and stature to which it feels entitled.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>But there are immediate and more tangible objectives as well. In Pekingʼs current campaign to gain broad recognition and support, its greatest successes -- numerically at least --have been in Africa. Even so unpromising a state as Equatorial Guinea has a vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly and can take a position favorable to Peking on such issues as nuclear non-proliferation and Chinese representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Moreover, future gains for Peking may well mean some losses for Taiwan: Ghana, which has relations with neither regime, is considering the <pb n="7" xml:id="d15-07" facs="d15-07"/>re-establishment of formal ties with Peking, and there are believed to be internal pressures in at least a couple of other states (e.g., Burundi, Sierra Leone) for extending recognition to the mainland regime. To the Chinese Peoplesʼ Republic (<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>) leaders -- whose options in Asia have long been limited by US and Soviet power, whose links to Europe have developed slowly, and whose internal political convulsions have evoked the worldʼs scorn -- the recent advances in Africa are seen as significant steps in overcoming Pekingʼs international isolation.</item>

                                    <item>Chinaʼs commitment to global revolutionary struggle has found active expression in its support of African liberation movements directed against the white minority-run areas in southern Africa: Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, and South Africa. Contact with such movements has been made relatively easy by the cooperation of several Black regimes also committed to liberating Africaʼs White Redoubt. Zambia and Tanzania, in particular, have provided liberation groups with continuing sanctuary, both for establishing headquarters and for launching guerrilla attacks against neighboring white states. In these <pb n="8" xml:id="d15-08" facs="d15-08"/>sanctuaries the Chinese have been allowed to supply weapons and financial aid, and (in Tanzania) training and even some ideological lectures to various revolutionary groups.</item>
                                    <label>6.</label>
                                    <item>In the early 1960s the Chinese extended occasional financial aid to a half-dozen national liberation groups. Like other supporters of African liberation, however, the Chinese have found these groups to be difficult to deal with and, with few exceptions, politically unreliable and militarily feckless. As a result, Peking gradually has adopted a tougher, more selective approach. Financial aid has dwindled, and the Chinese have concentrated on providing instructors for guerrilla training camps, supplying modest quantities of arms, and accepting small selected groups for training in China. Groups long accustomed to getting handouts have recently found Chinese officials to be far less generous with funds than with advice for improving discipline, organization, and “revolutionary self-reliance”. The Chinese also appear to be seeking a somewhat greater voice in the groups they support -- a tactic which led to strained relations with <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO1">FRELIMO</gloss>, the major guerrilla group operating in Mozambique.</item>
                                    <label>7.</label>
                                    <item>Chinaʼs failure to become the dominant patron of African liberation movements is due in large part to the independent <pb n="9" xml:id="d15-09" facs="d15-09"/>character of these movements. Although most of the major groups are avowedly pro-socialist, and many of their leaders given to Marxist slogans, they are first of all national movements: foreign support is required, but foreign domination is rejected. They have thus sought and received assistance from a variety of sources, including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Eastern and Western Europe, Cuba, and the African Liberation Committee of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, as well as from China. This independent attitude is compatible with Chinaʼs public line that it rejects “great power chauvinism”, as well as with its apparent unwillingness to undertake large-scale support and its limited capabilities for doing so. Peking probably does not seek the complete takeover and direction of any liberation group. It prefers instead to continue a long-term role as a supporter of national liberation, ready to provide revolutionary guidance and modest levels of aid to groups seriously engaged in guerrilla activity, even though this allows the Russians to score short-term gains with the liberation movement at Chinese expense.</item>
                                    <label>8.</label>
                                    <item>In the early 1960s the loose surveillance over foreigners and the absence of restrictions on their activities in a number of African countries enabled the Chinese to promote dissident groups working against some of the Black African regimes whose revolutionary credentials Peking found wanting. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> gave expression <pb n="10" xml:id="d15-10" facs="d15-10"/>to this policy at the end of an African tour in 1964, when he declared “Africa is ripe for revolution today”. This was disturbing news for the new Black national leaders, who thought their revolutions had already occurred. During this period Chinaʼs ill-disguised support to radical dissidents in Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, Senegal, Cameroon, and Congo (Kinshasa) had a disastrous impact on Chinaʼs African relations: several regimes broke off relations and ousted the Chinese, while others -- even among the more radically anti-Western states -- developed an abiding distrust of Chinese Communist intentions.</item>
                                    <label>9.</label>
                                    <item>After 1965 such activity rapidly diminished -- in part due to Pekingʼs recognition that revolution was not about to sweep across the African continent, and in part because Chinaʼs leaders were preoccupied with events at home. Currently the Chinese are not known to be actively working for the overthrow of any Black regimes, with the possible exception of Ethiopia, where they may still be involved in supplying some arms and training to the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. While Pekingʼs leaders are reported to be opposed to coups dʼetat, on the grounds that revolutions “from the top” only spawn more of the same, they seem to be cautiously exploring ways to assist the formation of serious, disciplined cadres of grass-roots revolutionaries to work toward the ultimate overthrow of Congo (K), Burundi, <pb n="11" xml:id="d15-11" facs="d15-11"/>and possibly other non-radical Black regimes. Moreover in two states -- Congo (B) and Zanzibar -- the Chinese have been extremely active in building support and gaining influence among stronger and more reliably radical elements within the regimes.</item>

This makes China the fifth largest aid donor in Black Africa, far below France, the US, and Britain, and about on a par with West Germany. Chinaʼs aid, however, has been highly concentrated (See Appendix, Table 1): of the dozen Sub-Saharan countries extended Chinese assistance, six account for almost 90 percent and three -- Tanzania, Zambia, and Guinea -- together account for 70 percent.</item>

                                        <item>The list reads like a roster of Black Africaʼs radical, leftward-leaning regimes. Indeed, where such a government has later been toppled from power by a less radical regime -- e.g., Ghana and Mali -- the new governments have often terminated Chinese aid. This concentration on Africaʼs radical states sharply distinguishes Chinese from Soviet aid. Although Chinaʼs revolutionary puritanism has led to some reluctance to assist ultra-conservative regimes, by far the chief constraint has been the unwillingness of all but a few African countries to accept Chinese aid.</item>

                                        <item>China also has been evolving its own distinctive economic aid model, consistent with its revolutionary image and limited aid capabilities. The Chinese advertise it as being the result of their own revolutionary experience, hence more appropriate to poor countries than models conceived in more technologically advanced nations. Their aid carries extremely soft financial terms. It involves a large element of technical and manual aid, and the largest number of projects have been labor-intensive and concentrated in agriculture, civil engineering, and light industry. Chinese technicians work hard, live austerely and seldom mix with local peoples, either socially or to conduct on-the-job <pb n="13" xml:id="d15-13" facs="d15-13"/>training. The Chinese seem to have found a low-cost, grass-roots type of aid which will be visible to broad segments of the rural population and not only the urban elite.</item>

                                        <item>But not all Chinese aid is low-cost and low-profile. In undertaking to build the Tanzam railway, which will link Zambiaʼs copper belt with the Tanzanian coast 1,100 miles away, Peking has embarked on its first major showcase project in Africa. To cover the Chinese contribution Peking has extended a $400 million, 30-year interest-free credit -- the largest ever extended to the Third World by a Communist country. Chinaʼs decision to plunge ahead was probably based on its appraisal of the railroadʼs strategic and political importance rather than its economic potential. Zambia and Tanzania have been by far the leading supporters of the liberation movements directed against southern Africa. The completed road will give Zambia access to the sea through a friendly country, in place of the traditional routes through Rhodesia and Mozambique or through Angola. By thus reducing somewhat Zambiaʼs vulnerability to economic retaliation for its aid to guerrillas operating in the south, the project is expected to contribute directly to the revolutionary,”anti-imperialist struggle”. Moreover Chinaʼs leaders are not unaware of the opportunity the Tanzam affords to score points against the Western powers: Chinaʼs offer to build the road <pb n="14" xml:id="d15-14" facs="d15-14"/>came less than a year after the World Bank had turned it down. But the Tanzam must be viewed as a special exception in Chinese foreign aid practice, and there is no reason to think Pekingʼs leaders are looking about for other expensive projects, or that they intend to raise their aid outlays to a level which would preempt other aid donors in Africa.</item>

                                        <item>Communist Chinaʼs economic aid has not so far led to any marked upsurge in Sino-African trade. Peking still accounts for about 2 percent of Black Africaʼs global imports, and less than 1 percent of its exports. Only Mali and Guinea conduct substantial shares of their trade with China. Sino-African trade is only slightly more important to the Chinese. Indeed, their only significant economic gain from this trade is a substantial export surplus -- on the order of $50 million a year, most of which represents hard currency earnings. Pekingʼs revolutionary zeal has not prevented its trading with South Africa. This trade, which goes unpublicized because of its political implications, is reported to have run as high as $12 million in some years. (Chinaʼs trade with Black Africa is shown in Appendix, Table 2).</item>

                                        <item>Chinese military aid to Sub-Saharan states has been small and concentrated. In contrast to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which has distributed more than $150 million of arms aid among 10 Black African countries, Communist China has extended something on the order of $25 million, all but a small part of which has gone to three countries: Tanzania, Congo (B), and Guinea.<note n="7" xml:id="d15fn7" type="source">Uganda, Ghana, and Mali also have received token quantities of military aid, believed to amount to no more than about a million dollars apiece.</note> In Tanzania, which accounts for about half the total extended, the Chinese program involves constructing a facility for small naval craft, scheduled for completion in mid-1971; a large Chinese training mission for the army; and providing the Tanzanian air wing with at least two squadrons of Migs -- probably Mig-19s -- and corresponding pilot training.</item>

                                        <item>All of this will take several years to complete. It is within Tanzaniaʼs absorptive capacity, in terms of the operational and maintenance skills which it will require; yet it meets the regimeʼs perceived need for modern air and naval capabilities, particularly for defense against punitive attacks from the white regimes to the south. It is even more important since Tanzania has terminated virtually all military aid from other countries. <pb n="16" xml:id="d15-16" facs="d15-16"/>In spite of Chinaʼs monopoly position, however, <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> and the general staff appear to be effectively isolating the Chinese from Tanzaniaʼs command and intelligence structures, and to be alert to the dangers of Chinese involvement in anything beyond the supply and training role. This appears to be in line with Chinaʼs notion of its proper role: in particular the Chinese have shown no inclination to be directly involved in Tanzanian or guerrilla hostilities.</item>

The diplomatic initiative has not been limited to the radically-inclined states. The most recent countries to extend formal recognition are Ethiopia, Nigeria, and one of Africaʼs leading non-starters, Equatorial Guinea. For these countries the establishment of diplomatic and trade-and-aid ties is a painless way to demonstrate their political non-alignment and their independence of the West, as well as to gain a potential new source of foreign aid. For the Chinese it is a chance to regain some of the international esteem which they threw away in the mid-1960s, as well as to win formal recognition and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> votes away from the Taiwan regime. <pb n="17" xml:id="d15-17" facs="d15-17"/>Indeed, recently for the first time Chinaʼs leaders have made pointed expressions of thanks to their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> backers.

Tanzania is the most notable example of a country susceptible on several counts to Chinese overtures. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>, its leader, is a dedicated supporter of the national liberation groups which carry out armed attacks against the White Redoubt. With good reason, he fears retaliation by the white states for his support of the guerrillas.

On another level, <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> was receptive to the Chinese way of doing things: ever eager to find organizational solutions to his countryʼs economic problems, he admires the Chinese organizational ability and work discipline, especially among the peasants, and has expressed the hope that his countrymen can learn from the Chinese example.</item>

                                        <item>With two regimes -- Congo (B) and Zanzibar<note n="8" xml:id="d15fn8" type="source">Zanzibar, although formally a part of Tanzania, is in fact largely autonomous.</note> -- the Chinese have been seeking ties with party, government, and other officials that go far beyond what any but a confused, vulnerable regime would tolerate. On Zanzibar they gained substantial influence among extremist officials of the ruling Revolutionary Council and the militant youth league of the ruling party. Through these officials the Chinese have exerted indirect pressure on the regime to take specific actions (e.g., to close the US Consulate). While such pressures are not known to have influenced government policies, they may have played a part in Zanzibarʼs decision to terminate Soviet and East German aid activities. President Karume and his immediate advisers are aware of what the Chinese are doing, but so far have done nothing to stop them. Meanwhile Peking has continued to implement an active and effective economic aid program; <pb n="19" xml:id="d15-19" facs="d15-19"/>indeed, as the last vestiges of Soviet and East German aid programs have been phased out, the Chinese currently are almost alone in providing military aid to Zanzibar.<note n="9" xml:id="d15fn9" type="source">There also have been reports that the Chinese plan to install a missile-tracking station on Zanzibar. Such reports appear to be without foundation so far. Should the Chinese decide to test-fire a long-range missile into the Indian Ocean, any instrument vessels which might be associated with the shot could make use of friendly ports on Zanzibar and the Tanzanian coast.</note>

                                        <item>Similarly in Congo (B) the tensions between President Nʼgouabi and the more radical political and military leaders impatient with his lack of revolutionary zeal have enabled the Chinese to gain influence among Congo (B)ʼs party and military elite. Ndalla-Graille, head of the Congo Workersʼ Party and a leading contender for national leadership in the event of N.ʼgouabiʼs overthrow, is but one of several important political figures who are strongly pro-Peking. Congo (B)ʼs army has come under the increasing influence of the Chinese, who currently have assigned 12 officers to teach political ideology as well as military subjects at the officer candidate school. In Brazzaville, as in Zanzibar, tribal and personal rivalries count for more than ideology in national politics; but, in both countries, the Chinese <pb n="20" xml:id="d15-20" facs="d15-20"/>have taken advantage of existing opportunities to win favor with the radical members of the elite, who they hope will ultimately lead these countries on a disciplined revolutionary path.</item>

                            <item>Any estimate on long-term Chinese policy is, of course, subject to the uncertainties of speculation on Chinaʼs leadership after Mao. But certain realities offer useful guidelines to speculation. There will remain distinct limits to Chinese Communist interest in Africa and African interest in Communist China. Neither side has anything fundamental at stake. With possibly one or two exceptions, the African states will continue to be concerned mainly with domestic problems, and their international relations will be dominated by regional African matters and ties to Western Europe. Chinaʼs primary external interests will continue to lie in its relations with such problem areas as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the US, Southeast Asia, and Japan. In economic terms, too, the reciprocal interests of Africa and China will remain marginal: neither will be a significant source of the capital goods which each requires, and each region offers a narrow and uncertain market for the otherʼs exports. Within these limits, Sino-African relations will fluctuate in response to shifting needs and priorities on each side.</item>

                            <item>As in the 1960s, Africa will be an area where, at little risk or cost, Chinaʼs leadership can cause trouble for US and Soviet interests and enhance its status as a champion of revolution and of the poor countries against the rich. The intensity of its interest in such activity will be, in part, a function of the availability of opportunities elsewhere. A lack of favorable movement in relations with the US or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might lead to more intense activity to turn Black African states against the super powers and to promote the most radical elements within existing Black regimes. Should Chinese relations with countries of major concern become more normalized, however, Peking might be somewhat <pb n="22" xml:id="d15-22" facs="d15-22"/>less interested in Africa generally, and in promoting revolutionary activity in particular.</item>
                            <label>24.</label>
                            <item>Peking is likely, in any event, to rely more on state-to-state relations than on revolutionary action to enhance its influence in Africa during the 1970s. Provocatory Chinese meddling with radical dissidents, which turned off much of Black Africa in the 1960s, would seem to have an equally bleak future now among the majority of African states which do not recognize the Peking regime. A more moderate course would be even more likely if, as expected, Maoʼs successors prove to be somewhat less interested in promoting world revolution and more concerned with the political and economic problems of the Chinese state and with building its political influence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere. This would not however, preclude continuing modest support to national liberation groups active against the white-dominated regimes in the south.</item>

                            <item>Chinese Communist entry to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would, of course, provide Peking with additional opportunities to demonstrate solidarity with the objectives of Black Africa. The Chinese would win some Black African applause by supporting resolutions and procedural moves against South Africa, Portugal, and Rhodesia, or in favor of broader African representation in deliberations on the seabeds, disarmament, the Indian Ocean and similar issues. The Chinese might also provide a degree of procedural guidance and focus for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> activities of the more radical African states, particularly in such bodies as <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss>. It is also likely, however, that Pekingʼs representatives would bring dissension to the already divided Black African caucus -- for example, on touchy issues like initiating dialogue with South Africa -- and would incur African hostility by trying to intrude into intra-African deliberations. In short, Sino-African ties at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> probably would more or less duplicate in microcosm Sino-African relations generally.</item>

                            <item>In sum, Communist China will continue to be an important source of support for two or three radical African regimes, and will probably expand fairly rapidly its formal ties to a few more Black African states -- Ghana is a likely early prospect. Foreign aid is likely to expand somewhat beyond the low levels of past years, depending mainly on African receptivity and on the opportunities Peking sees for aid to be a useful adjunct in furthering diplomatic initiatives in particular countries. There is no reason to believe, however, that Communist China will seek to be-come a major source of assistance. Nor is China likely to dominate political or economic events in any African country. Chinaʼs efforts to expand its influence will be inhibited by tribal frictions, personal ambitions, and local issues which together will continue to dominate African politics during the 1970s. The Chinese will continue, as in the decade past, to learn about Black Africa through trial and error. Temporary successes will be followed by unexpected reverses, while Pekingʼs representatives will continue to seek ways to gain China a more assured place in Black African affairs -- one that will endure beyond the life-span of the typical African government.</item>

                        <p rend="flushleft">PLACE: The Oval Office</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">After an initial exchange of greeting and amenities President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked President <persName corresp="#p_SLS1">Senghor</persName> to speak to Senegalʼs problems and the state of relations between Senegal and the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">In responding President <persName corresp="#p_SLS1">Senghor</persName> mentioned two broad categories of problems: (1) those relating to cultural and political independence and (2) those relating to cultural and economic development. He then made extensive references to his cultural and academic background, studies in French schools and universities where he was a classmate of Pompidou, and at the same time brought out the fact that for himself, as well as the Senegalese in general, the French language and culture, while very important, are only a complement since the roots of Senegal culture are essentially in black Africa. From his days in secondary schools in France Senghor endeavored to cultivate and enhance the values of the black African civilization. This latter was expressed by him in his statements about “negritude”. He also traced the main phases of his countryʼs accession to independent status within the framework of a French speaking union and the role played in those historic events by both <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Next he dealt more specifically with education and the reforms undertaken in his country. He pointed out some of the differences between Senegalʼs education system and that of France. He is giving great stress to the study of mathematics and technical and engineering subjects. At the present time half of the math professors in the university of Senegal are native, and it is expected that five years from now all of those as well as instructors in engineering and allied subjects will be Senegalese. Regarding linguistic problems, he mentioned the parallel existence of native languages, of French as a working language and, since 1964, of English being a required subject in <pb n="2" xml:id="d16-02" facs="d16-02"/>secondary and technical schools. He went on to describe the part played by Senegal in the Western world as both a West African and an Atlantic country that has had century-old relationships with Europe. He stated that the civilization of the future is now evolving, and that it will be an international and eclectic civilization, rather than a national and parochial one, with each component bringing in its own valuable contribution and sharing the contribution of all other components. For that reason he has advocated the entry of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> into the European economic community with eventually the English speaking countries of Africa and of the West Indies also joining in a broader association. This is consistent with the idea of a world where different groups of civilizations live in a state of harmony and understanding.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">As for Senegalʼs relations with the United States, those are a natural consequence of the relations of Senegal with Europe, and of the many black people throughout the Americas. Thus Africa feels closer to America than to Asia. In his view when an Afro-Asian meeting was called the presence of Latin America was deemed indispensable and he himself felt much closer to a Brazilian, for instance, than to a Chinese.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">He mentioned in passing that his name was Portuguese, that he had Portuguese-named forebears and some Portuguese blood, as did some 100, 000 other Senegalese. At this point President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked whether this could not create political difficulties for him, and President <persName corresp="#p_SLS1">Senghor</persName> replied smiling, “Well, that is a political matter and of course that is something else”. He then described the cultural pattern of Senegal as being one of a balanced blend in which an educated Senegalese would normally know, at least one of the native languages, French, and very likely English or another language. In this way he felt that more and more Senegalese were in a position to participate in a truly universal civilization.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">During his recent trip throughout the United States where he had an opportunity to address university students, black as well as white, he pointed out that the civilization of the 21st century was being molded to a large extent in the United States. The reason why the United States was playing such an important role in shaping the future was not just because of its material wealth and power but perhaps mainly because of its creativity, enthusiasm, and youthful dynamism which are to be found in the United States to a greater extent than in Europe. Also the United States has this great responsibility of carrying on the tradition of blending within itself different ethnic groups such as the Anglo-Saxons, the Latins, Slays, Germans, and also blacks.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">When some black students in the United States asked him whether they should go back to Africa he replied in the negative, saying that if he were young he would want to come to the United States as a teacher because of the role played by the <pb n="3" xml:id="d16-03" facs="d16-03"/>United States in shaping the civilization of the future. He added that it was essential that the basic values of “negritude” with all its warmth and vitality be recognized and brought into a full participation in the overall pattern of American civilization. And that is why he believed in and supported the fullest measure of integration in the U.S. as being the only viable solution. It was important for the blacks to feel that they were contributing something to the cultural life of the country and not just acting as mere consumers of culture. That participation in cultural activities was for him a very important element on a par with improvement in the economic status.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">In regard to political developments in Africa and Senegal he said at the outset that whatever disagreements might occur at times between his and the Western countries were of but minor importance. What constituted a danger for his country were a rather broad range of Communist activities. In Senegal itself the left wing student movement represented only 10%. He indicated that there had been a shift in Communist influence from the Russian, which was quite prevalent at the time of independence, to the much stronger present influence of Communist China which presented a definite danger since it came not directly from Peking but rather through Paris. It is this strong and well established French cultural influence that explains why certain Senegalese Communists will go to Moscow and upon their return will no longer be Communists, whereas many non-Communist individuals will go to Paris and come back Communists. While the Russian activities are watched, they are not considered particularly dangerous and as a matter of fact the President intends to visit the Soviet Union next year. As for the Chinese Communists they do present a definite danger through their activities out of Paris and out of their embassies in neighboring countries such as that in Nouakchott. Senegal has become a key target country in the Chinese Communist strategy pattern because of its growing political and economic importance. At the present time Senegal is surrounded by three countries, Mauritania, Mali and Guinea where the Chinese Communists are most active, not only in supplying funds but even in advocating violence. An example of that was an attempt by a group of black and French extremists to bomb the French cultural center during President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>ʼs visit to Senegal. However, since it is not too easy to keep a secret in Senegal the authorities were able to take appropriate measures.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Regarding the new policy toward the Chinese Peoples Republic <pb n="4" xml:id="d16-04" facs="d16-04"/>on the part of the United States he understood the reasons of the United States and he himself has been supporting the admission of mainland China to the United Nations while at the same time keeping Taiwan in the organization. After all, there are more than 700 million Chinese and it is important to be able to talk with them. At one time he had to expel a number of Communist newspapermen from China and North Korea. This brought about assassination threats, but he remains undaunted in his determination to defend the independence of his country against any threats on the part of the Russians and particularly of the Chinese. The Communist Chinese presence is a growing danger in many parts of Africa since they extend their activities from Somalie to Zambia and are moving more and more into West Africa. In Central Africa they have been very active in Congo (Brazzaville) and now his friend Ahidjo (of Cameroon) is faced with the presence of a Communist Chinese Embassy in his capital. Still he refuses to have the Chinese Communists represented in his country.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said that he realized that the Communist Chinese danger was greater to a country like Senegal than that of Moscow. He mentioned the fact that the United States was entering into a new phase in its relations with the Chinese Peoples Republic on a restrained basis involving mainly trade. He stressed that he had no illusions about the designs of the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> as well as those of the Soviets. He knew they intended to expand their influence wherever they could. Still, there is the need for developing some sort of modus vivendi and some sort of a live-and-let-live policy. The fact is that if 25 years from now the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, with more than one billion inhabitants is still outside the family of nations and has developed a major atomic arsenal, that country will have become a truly unacceptable danger. The President referred to the substantial progress made in the arms control discussions with the Soviets and added that even if a perfect agreement were arrived at between the US and the Soviets on arms control that would be of no use in the not too distant future because of the growing danger presented by the Chinese. He was trying to see events in their historic perspective. The US friendship for the Republic of China remains undiminished. But it is necessary to have a pragmatic outlook and think not just in terms of the present but of the future insofar as the leadership position of the United States is concerned. That position seems to require that some efforts be made to ameliorate Pekingʼs isolation from most of the world. He was well aware that in todayʼs world, in Africa, in Latin America, even in the United States, this new virus was at work, not that of Moscow but of Mao. Here a dangerous philosophy is involved, much more dangerous and effective than the rather crude efforts of the Soviets through their Comintern. While there seemed to be at times a certain idealism in the Soviet actions, the Maoists seemed to be bent on destruction for the sake of destruction, and their dangerous influence extends even to the United States. Even though the United States has made certain moves with regard to Peking it continues to bear in mind the fact that Peking intends to intervene in the internal affairs of countries in Asia, particularly Southeast Asia as well as in Latin America and that of course is a matter of concern to the United States. That being the situation it is heartening for the United States to have this con-tact with such an enlightened and understanding leader in Africa. The President said this was particularly so because there are some leaders in Latin America, Africa and Asia who are quite naive regarding the true essence of the conflict and who continue to consider the United States and other Western powers as imperialists, which had some truth at one time, but is no longer relevant.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d16-05" facs="d16-05"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Today, while the United States, France and the United Kingdom may be no angels, still colonialism is gone and the best hope for the less developed countries is to establish close ties of trade and investment with the so-called capitalists. In Africa there are different views from country to country regarding the extent of state control and of free enterprise, but it is important that in working for its development that Africa look to the North and to the West rather than to the East. He understood that President <persName corresp="#p_SLS1">Senghor</persName> and his country must try to get along with many different countries but he was sure that President <persName corresp="#p_SLS1">Senghor</persName> realized where there was the greatest measure of hope. Senegal is a country endowed with substantial material and human resources which can best be developed through private investment rather than through an impossible form of Communist state. The President said that the handling by the United States of its relations with its own black population is a very important factor in the overall pattern of relations with African countries, because if the blacks are deprived of adequate opportunities in the United States this will influence African countries who then may look elsewhere for leadership. He referred to the progress that has been made in the United States in racial matters. Then he concluded that part of his remarks by saying that each new country in Africa had to choose its own way. He referred to Senegal as a significant example of a constructive association with a former colonial power.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">President <persName corresp="#p_SLS1">Senghor</persName> then talked about economic matters. He made specific reference to the vital need for dams which are particularly important in a country where there is little rain. He referred to the assistance provided by certain specialized agencies of the United Nations and also the World Bank, with a specific reference to Mr. McNamara whom he considered a friend and with whom he was going to sign three agreements that afternoon. The other matter was that of the fishing industry which needed to be developed and in that connection he cited the issue of fishing waters as separated from territorial waters and mentioned the fact that Senegal had denounced the 1958 agreements regarding those waters. He had already been in touch with State Department Legal Adviser Stevenson and mentioned that an American special mission would be coming to Senegal to discuss territorial and fishing waters issues. Speaking of the territorial waters proper his country did not intend to push for a 200 mile limit such as that advocated by several Latin American countries. He understood the strategic implications of territorial waters for the United States and had also discussed that matter with the French. But as for fishing waters, he described that issue as one of life or death for his country, particularly since the Russians and the Chinese were more and more active in indiscriminate fishing off the coast of Senegal. He also mentioned that there are potential oil and iron resources in Senegal and that American companies had been granted prospecting licenses.</p>

                        <p>1. In the 1960s, the newly independent states of East Africa seemed to be off to a promising start. Under national rulers of considerable stature, the countries set about devising means of developing their societies and economies in an atmosphere of relative political stability. The brief army mutinies of 1964, which simultaneously afflicted Uganda, Kenya, and Tanganyika,<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3" type="source">Tanganyika federated with Zanzibar several months later in 1964 to form the state of Tanzania.</note> were quickly sup-pressed with assistance from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and appeared to have a salutary effect on government relations with the military. In colonial times, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had established common transportation, communications, and monetary services for Kenya, Tanganyika1, and Uganda. In 1967, these services were consolidated in an East African Community (EAC). Each of the national rulers confronted and over-came internal political challenges. President <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kenneth Kaunda</persName>ʼs leadership qualities were tested by adversities, and his friendship with President <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">JULIUS NYERERE</persName> of Tanzania helped bring Zambia much closer to the EAC.</p>
                        <p>2. The euphoria of this immediate, post-independence period has since given way to frustration and disappointment. The rulers of East Africa, like their counterparts else-where on the continent, have gradually found themselves confronted with a host of worsening problems: for example, inefficiency and corruption in government, dimming prospects for sustained economic growth, growing rates of unemployment and urbanization, difficulties caused by replacing foreigners in government and commerce, and the resurgence of tribal jealousies. Domestic pressures, mutual suspicions of the national leaders, and the uneven patterns of development of the various economies have led to more nationalistic postures in foreign relations. Though spared the civil strife which afflicted Nigeria and the “revolving door” presidential changes of small West African states, East Africa is clearly passing through a period of change and challenge in which former arrangements and agreements are under increasing pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d17-06" facs="d17-06"/>
                        <p>3. The overthrow of Ugandaʼs President <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Milton Obote</persName> by General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Idi Amin</persName> in January 1971 significantly altered the traditional alignments in the area and underscored the critical importance of personality in African regional and national politics. And, to a large extent, the predilections of the national leader determine the character of relations with neighboring states. Obote was an ardent sup-porter of Nyerere; <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> considers <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> a dangerous radical and an enemy. Insults and sabre-rattling between the two leaders have worsened relations. Shortly after <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs coup, Tanzanian troops headed towards the Ugandan border and <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> contemplated military action to restore Obote; he still does not recognize the new regime, and a variety of further provocations have kept the feud alive. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> accuses <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> of harboring and training pro-Obote guerrillas. Small armed border clashes have aggravated the situation.</p>
                        <p>4. The dispute between <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> is both personal and ideological. It has contributed to an atmosphere of distrust among other African leaders in the area who also lean towards simplistic views of foreign relations (i.e., seeing neighbors as pro-Arab or anti-Arab, pro-Communist or anti-Communist). President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> of Congo (Kinshasa) has talked with Amin about creating a belt of anti-Arab, anti-Communist nations (Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and the Congo) to stem the southward flow of radicalism, which they fear, and to isolate <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>. Though no formal arrangements are in the cards, a variety of bilateral ties tend to bring the conservative states together. Kenya is providing assistance to the Ugandan security services. Kenya and Ethiopia have defense agreements against Somali irrendentist efforts. Uganda, Congo (Kinshasa), and Ethiopia are supporting the southern Sudanese in their struggle against Khartoum and are cooperating in various ways, but for different reasons, with the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>5. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>6. Meanwhile, Tanzania and Zambia are building a special relationship of their own. Nyerere and Kaunda are close friends and are both personally committed to the liberation movements in southern Africa. They pro-vide support to a variety of freedom fighters and have become the leading spokesmen and lobbyists for their cause. In addition, Zambia depends to a large extent on the Tanzanian pipeline, road system, and port of Dar es Salaam. The most dramatic connection, how-ever, is the Tan/Zam Railroad, which, after many years of study and planning, is now under construction and scheduled for completion by 1975. This huge and costly project will lessen Zambiaʼs dependence on transportation routes through Rhodesia and Portuguese territories.</p>
                        <p>7. The current political conflict between Tanzania and Uganda plus a host of unilateral economic moves by each member country have already limited the scope and effectiveness of the EAC. The trend is away from the <pb n="7" xml:id="d17-07" facs="d17-07"/>idea of a common market. The EAC no longer has a common currency. Trade is more restricted than it was, and there is duplication of industries. In the past year, Uganda has expelled Tanzanian and Kenyan workers, Tanzania has set up exchange controls, and Kenya has imposed currency movement restrictions. Ugandan and Tanzanian officials have wrangled for months about appointments to the EAC staff, and President <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> of Kenya has chosen not to intervene. In the past, the EACʼs success was largely due to the determination of Obote, <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> to cooperate for the common good. This spirit no longer prevails, though the leaders make public gestures of support for the community.</p>
                        <p>8. A fundamental problem in regional economic cooperation is the imbalance among the economies of the EAC member countries. Kenya earns a huge trade surplus in intra-community trade because its manufacturing sector is large (for Africa) and diversified. Kenyan manufactured exports have increased despite a transfer tax established to protect domestic industries in Uganda and Tanzania. By comparison, Uganda and Tanzania have small manufacturing sectors, and nationalizations in both have discouraged foreign investment. Various indirect subsidies compensate for their losses in trade with Kenya, however. For example, landlocked Uganda benefits from the favorable rates on rail shipments of agricultural products to the Kenyan port of Mombasa.</p>
                        <p>9. The EACʼs greatest success has been preserving the common services established by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>: railways, harbors, airways, postal and telecommunications services, and electrical power. Other African countries (Zambia, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Somalia) have in the past applied to join the EAC, but none are prepared to give much to the community. Zambia wants to use the railways and roads; Burundi is eager to use ports and harbors but nothing else; Ethiopia hopes to enter the common market, but does not desire to participate in other activities of the community; Somalia, pleading poverty, asks for special considerations. Zambia suspended its application after Oboteʼs overthrow. Adapting to the EACʼs protective tariff would cause difficulty for Zambia, which has few manufacturing industries and already suffers from the high cost of trade diversion from southern Africa. Nevertheless, Zambia probably will join, assuming the EAC overcomes its current difficulties.</p>
                        <p>10. Kenyaʼs attitude, however, will continue to be the key to the future of the EAC. Kenyatta apparently believes that Tanzania is taking great advantage of Kenya monetarily and not fulfilling its EAC obligations. He is concerned that Chinese imports are replacing Kenyan imports in Tanzania and believes that Tanzania would be practically bankrupt with-out Chinese support. Kenya pays the largest share of EAC expenses, but the favorable trade balance is an inducement to stay in the EAC.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>11. The governments of East Africa are beset by problems common to other African lands: maintaining some kind of authority over disparate tribal, ethnic, and special interest groups; increasing government services to satisfy growing public demands while handicapped by severely limited resources; and reducing dependence on foreign entrepreneurs and advisors without greatly restricting the efficiency of either the government or the economy. Each country, however, has its own unique set of troublesome issues and national priorities. The styles of government differ from country to country, but all are run by tough, authoritarian rulers with strong personalities. This characteristic makes political stability dependent on the nature and staying power of the national leader.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">A. Kenya</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. Kenya has for a decade ranked among the most stable and most prosperous countries in Black Africa, but tribal frictions—and the increasingly partisan performance of the national leaders—have created an atmosphere of tension and unrest. The Kikuyu tribal community, able, industrious, and aggressive, has been consolidating its hold on the government, reaping most of the economic benefits of independence, and seeking to improve its position in the army as well. The Kikuyu establishment, with President <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>ʼs knowledge and support, is making a power play, blatant and unconcealed, to assure its pre-eminence after Kenyattaʼs death or incapacitation. This approach, buttressed by chilling tribal oaths never to relinquish power, has built up resentment among other tribal groups and ensures a difficult period of political adjustment after <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>ʼs death. The Kikuyu with only about 20 percent of the population would find it very difficult to govern without the acquiescence of other tribes.</p>
                        <p>13. Opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>ʼs inner circle of southern Kikuyu politicians is found not only in the leadership of other major tribes (the Luo and Kamba) but also among clans of the northern Kikuyu, who have not gotten their share of the spoils of office. Although a majority in the National Assembly supports the regime, some backbenchers have attacked the government for corruption, nepotism, and in-efficiency; they have also spoken out against all foreign interests in Kenya and have urged the government to follow a more militant policy on southern Africa. Potentially the most important focus of opposition, however, is in the armed forces, traditionally dominated in the upper grades by the Kamba. Some in the army think that political intervention by the army will be necessary sooner or later. These feelings were greatly strengthened by Aminʼs coup in Uganda. The army is also jealous of the Kikuyu-dominated General Services Unit ( GSU), a well-armed paramilitary police force. The Chief of the Defense Staff, a Kamba, was implicated with some Luo politicians and a few other Kambas in a recent coup plot and forced to resign. His colleagues remain on edge. As long as Kenyatta is in power, however, there are many factors which militate against a military coup.</p>
                        <p>14. The Kikuyus remain in possession of considerable assets with which to counter moves against their dominant position. They control a reasonably efficient police and security apparatus acutely sensitive to anti-regime activities. The GSU, unlike many other paramilitary outfits in Africa, is considered to be an effective force. And, even in the army, the Kikuyus are gaining strength, especially in the junior and middle grade officer ranks. But the old guard of Kikuyu politicians depends heavily on <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>, who commands vast respect and power as father of his country. He is also a shrewd and skillful politician, as he demonstrated by his astute handling of</p>

                        <p>the recent coup plotting. Though nearly 80 (no one knows for sure how old he is), <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> continues to demonstrate vigor and authority. Yet, a few years ago, he had some mild strokes, and still complains of circulatory problems.</p>
                        <p>15. Even with <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> on the scene, the country will be increasingly affected by mounting unemployment and population growth. Kenyaʼs economy is growing at around 6 or 7 percent a year, and, among under-developed countries, Kenyaʼs growing output, price stability, and degree of capital formation are exceptional. The population is in-creasing, however, at a rate of about 3 per-cent a year, and there are not nearly enough jobs to satisfy the hundreds of thousands of partially educated youth and other migrants to the cities. The increase in the numbers of unemployed and underemployed African city dwellers has led the government to put pressure on Asian entrepreneurs and bureaucrats, thousands of whom have lost their livelihoods. Pressures are growing for a still more comprehensive assault on all foreigners holding jobs coveted by Kenyans.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">B. Uganda</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. The tribal violence and breakdown of order, only a possibility in Kenya, is a reality in Uganda and is taking on some aspects of the Congo in its most turbulent days. The crime rate has jumped dramatically, and the police are unable to cope with nation-wide assaults by armed bands. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs effort to purge the army of its pro-Obote elements got out of hand, as local commanders seized the opportunity to settle old scores and massacre tribal contingents. Soldiers from <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs West Nile tribe have been fighting soldiers from the Acholi and Lango tribes (the latter Oboteʼs kinsmen). At the time of <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs coup, the army numbered some 8,000 officers and men. Since then, approximately 2,000 of these have either deserted or been killed. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> claims that most lost their lives in clashes with pro-Obote guerrillas from Tanzania, but he is clearly using the relatively small border clashes as an explanation for losses caused by domestic tribal clashes. The army, never well disciplined, appears to be out of control in some areas.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has changed the character of the army in other ways too. He came to power largely with the support of devoted followers among the enlisted men. Many of them have been promoted to the senior officer ranks, thus infuriating many of the old timers as well as ambitious and better qualified junior officers. He has also packed the army with his own West Nile tribesmen. The size of the army has grown to approximately 10,000 de-spite the losses described above. And <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has instructed his ministers to spare no expense in equipping the army with modern weapons, tanks, and planes (“to get to Khartoum or Dar es Salaam and back”).</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> himself is a blunt and colorful speaker. He has spent much of his time stumping the country, and he has acquired considerable popularity despite his tendency to put his foot in his mouth. Until recently, he had handled the Baganda, Ugandaʼs largest and most advanced tribe, quite well. They were delighted to be rid of Obote, who had systematically excluded them from national politics. Shortly after <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> took over, they were permitted to bury their traditional tribal king, the Kabaka, who had died in exile. But, after raising hopes among the Baganda that they would be permitted to crown a new Kabaka, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> announced that he would not permit the re-establishment of the kingdom. This is an important matter in Ugandaʼs tribal society. The Baganda elders yearn for a Kabaka to preserve their tribal identity, while other tribes <pb n="12" xml:id="d17-12" facs="d17-12"/>fear a resurgence of Baganda hegemony. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs awkward handling of this troublesome issue will cause him problems with the Baganda for some time to come.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs cabinet includes some capable technicians who are not allowed to make decisions, and the government is on the whole badly managed or not managed at all. The economy is in especially bad shape. Oboteʼs lavish spending on such projects as a huge assembly hall for the Organization of African Unity had already depleted Ugandaʼs foreign exchange reserves when <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> took over. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs appetite for military hardware seems to be insatiable. He has already made some expensive purchases, and his ambitious plans for further military expenditures are likely to produce a large budget deficit, despite some austerity in non-military spending. More borrowing abroad is going to be very difficult, given Ugandaʼs worsening financial situation and unfavorable prospects. Prices are rising, especially for staple foods. The government has moderated some of Oboteʼs more extreme nationalization schemes and reinstituted some incentives and guarantees to foreign investors. But continued instability and limits on over-seas remittances will discourage foreign in-vestment. The government may be forced to cut back both its payroll and imports, thus diminishing its popularity still further.</p>

                        <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">JULIUS NYERERE</persName>, who calls himself Mwalimu (the teacher), probably has the most ambitious plans of any African leader for reordering the structure of his society (e.g., through communal villages and educational reforms designed to convince students of the virtues of farming). His program is, in a sense, the reversal of the standard concept of modernization through urban development, industrialization, and the cultivation ofan educated elite. But, despite <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>ʼs charm and personal appeal, his schemes have not caught on. The peasants resist changes in their traditional ways of doing things; the students still strive for desk jobs in the cities; and government officials, unlike <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>, are not convinced of the virtues of personal austerity. Though <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> does not have to con-tend with serious tribal problems, he nonetheless labors under some pretty heavy burdens.</p>
                        <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> is an impulsive leader who dominates Tanzanian political life. He is occasionally influenced by radicals in the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU ), the official party. Two of his most recent initiatives, the Acquisition of Property Act and the creation of a Peopleʼs Militia,—taken after TANU prodding—have aroused considerable concern and some potentially significant op-position. The property act enabled the government to acquire all rental housing valued at more than $14,000. In one fell swoop, Tanzanian businessmen and officials were deprived of their last safe investment opportunity and much of their revenue and source of collateral. Most affected were the prosperous Asians, whose unpopularity and political weakness made them an easy target. Many of the most skilled and talented members of the Asian community have fled the country, including members of the Aga Khanʼs Ismaili sect. Most of the Ismailis had become Tanzanian citizens and contributed a great deal to the country, but the Aga Khan recently came to fear for their safety. He is now suggesting that they leave while they can still salvage something. The exodus represents not only a loss of critically needed skills and entrepreneurship, but a substantial drain as well on Tanzaniaʼs already slender foreign exchange holdings. Moreover, as Asians have closed down their businesses and halted their building projects, a large number of Africans have been thrown out of work. Consumer shortages <pb n="13" xml:id="d17-13" facs="d17-13"/>and rising prices add to the economic malaise and, if prolonged, will feed the general dissatisfaction with <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>.</p>
                        <p>22. The establishment of a civilian Peopleʼs Militia, in the wake of the coup in Uganda, was designed in part as a deterrent to a military coup in Tanzania. It may instead have laid the groundwork for one. In other African countries, e.g., in Ghana and Mali, the creation of a rival militia of this sort triggered an angry outburst in the army. While we do not know much about attitudes within the Tanzanian Army, it is clear that the level of grumbling has increased. One of the most common complaints is over the presence of as many as 600 Chinese advisors with the armed forces; other grounds for dissatisfaction include the attention given to supporting Ugandan exiles and general misgivings over <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>ʼs brinkmanship in dealings with <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs regime. So far discontent within the army has been passive, and there are no identifiable cliques in the officer corps.</p>
                        <p>23. Mainland Tanzaniaʼs relations with Zanzibar have always been shaky. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> engineered the federation between Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964 because he feared the spread of radical influences to the mainland. Sheikh Karume, the dominant figure in Zanzibarʼs Revolutionary Council, felt the need for support and protection so that he could consolidate his control over the island. These concerns are no longer so important. Despite the union, Zanzibar has retained independence in most fields and remains a brutal police state run on the whims of an arbitrary clique. Karume, who is also First Vice-President of Tanzania, resented <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>ʼs interference in his persecution of the Arabs and Asians left on the island. He now fears that <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>ʼs government is trying to gain control over Zanzibarʼs relatively hefty foreign exchange re-serves. The two leaders will probably continueto make compromises in order to keep the union going, partly because their prestige would suffer if it were dissolved. Thus the union is likely to muddle along as long as <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> and Karume are in power, but few other Tanzanians would mourn its passing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">D. Zambia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>24. Zambia is beset by tribal problems akin to those in Kenya. The aggressive Bemba are out to enlarge their already substantial share of national jobs and benefits. Large numbers of young Bemba have left their inhospitable homeland in the northeast to work in the copper mines where labor and urban unrest is growing. But, unlike the Kikuyu, their aspirations far exceed their political power. At the most recent conclave of President Kaundaʼs ruling party, Bemba representation was cut back and a high level party post held by a Bemba was abolished. Other incidents have brought some prominent Bemba leaders, including former ministers, to charge the government with persecution of the tribe.</p>
                        <p>25. In August 1971, SIMON KAPWEPWE, a former vice president of Zambia and the best known Bemba, announced the formation of a new party—composed almost entirely of Bemba—to compete with <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>ʼs. The potential cooperation between this new party and the long dormant African National Congress Party is creating awkward political problems for <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>. Though the two parties have nothing in common except opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>, they have sought to capitalize on the electorateʼs discontent over rising prices, unemployment, and food shortages. In September, <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> cracked down hard on Kapwepweʼs party, despite its failure to generate much visible support even among the Bemba. About 100 of its leaders were arrested under Zambiaʼs security laws. The arrests may eventually lead to a formal banning of the party. <pb n="14" xml:id="d17-14" facs="d17-14"/>Politically conscious Bemba will be further alienated, although few will probably risk public disagreement with <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>ʼs stem measures.</p>
                        <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> uses his personal stature, political skills, and control of national patronage to hold dissident politicians in line. <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> is one of the few Zambians, however, who has some sense of national—rather than tribal—identity. His disdain for tribal bickering is respected, though not always shared, by his followers. His stubborn insistence that unity be preserved is probably the major barrier to tribally-based political chaos.</p>
                        <p>27. The Zambian economy is dominated by the nationalized copper industry, which ac-counts for more than 90 percent of exports and gives the Zambian Government some options denied to less richly endowed African governments. In the Zambian order of priorities, considerable attention is paid to means of avoiding dependence upon white-ruled southern African states. Accordingly, much of the income from the copper mines has gone for pipelines, new transportation routes, and alternate sources of fuel and power. The Zambian economy remains undiversified, and the agricultural sector is unable to come close to satisfying domestic requirements for food. Consequently, Zambiaʼs import bill amounts to nearly $440 million a year, the second highest figure in Black Africa, exceeded only by Nigeria. For political reasons, Zambia has been shifting its trade from Rhodesia and South Africa, despite the resulting disruptions in re-liability, efficiency, and cost to transport. Even so, the Zambian Government still has to depend on the white-controlled territories for food imports, coal, electrical power, and transportation facilities.</p>
                        <p>28. Zambia is vulnerable not only to the sharp fluctuations of the price of copper, but also to various kinds of retaliation from thewhite-ruled lands of southern Africa. Early this year, after five Portuguese civilians were kidnapped in Mozambique by a minor liberation movement and then killed in Zambia, the Portuguese refused to permit Zambian corn imports to pass through ports in Angola and Mozambique. Zambia suffered a period of food shortages and then purchased corn from Rhodesia to forestall another one. Zambians also realize that their security forces (6,600 men) are incapable of repelling an invasion by Portuguese, Rhodesian, or South African Armed Forces. <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>, who believes in keeping open lines of communication with the white-ruled states, has signed an agreement of sorts with the Portuguese, placed some additional curbs on the minor liberation movements, and sought a rapproachement with Malawi, which has acted as an intermediary during disputes. Although Kaunda has so far been unwilling to clamp down on the more important liberation movements, he is clearly trying to avoid another confrontation with the Portuguese.</p>

In undertaking to build the Tan/Zam Railway, which will link Zambiaʼs copper belt with the Tanzanian coast 1,100 miles away, Peking has embarked on its first major show-case project overseas. The Chinese have ex-tended a $400 million, 30-year interest-free credit. The Africans have agreed to purchase Chinese goods to sell for the local currency needed. Approximately 13,000 Communist Chinese laborers are now in Tanzania working on the first phase of the railroadʼs construction. The Chinese offered to build the road less than a year after the World Bank turned it down. They probably did so largely to increase their prestige in the Third World and to associate themselves more directly with the supporters of the southern African liberation movements.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="d17-15" facs="d17-15"/>
                        <p>30. On the whole, the Zambians, traditionally suspicious of all foreigners, are more wary of the Chinese than are the Tanzanians. The Zambian Government is alert to any at-tempts at political indoctrination, and its intelligence services try to keep close tabs on Chinese personnel. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> has stressed the need for caution in dealing with the Chinese workers, and his political party has instructed local officials not to fraternize with the Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> takes a rather different approach. He admires the Chinese organizational ability and work discipline, and has expressed his hope that his countrymen can learn from the Chinese example. At the same time, Nyerere is wary of Chinese political indoctrination.</p>
                        <p>31. Since the departure of the Canadian military mission in 1970, the Chinese Communists have become the sole suppliers, ad-visors, and trainers of the Tanzanian Armed Forces. They are directing the construction of new naval facilities, rare in East Africa, at Dar es Salaam and helping to develop air and naval units as well. Nearly 350 Tanzanian naval and air force personnel are being trained in Communist China. Chinese advisors are working closely with Tanzanian army and militia units, but Tanzanian senior officers have been careful to keep Chinese advisors out of the general command structure.</p>
                        <p>32. The Soviets may be displeased about the magnitude of the Chinese effort in Tanzania and Zambia, but they have shown little inclination to compete with China to win friends and influence governments. Russian aid programs are small, credits extended earlier have not been drawn down, and terms offered by Moscow are not deemed very generous by <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>. In Zanzibar, the Soviet (and East German) aid programs have been displaced by Chinese programs.</p>

                        <p>33. Oboteʼs overthrow in Uganda cannot have been a subject of much concern in Moscow and Peking. Oboteʼs sporadic outbursts of anti-Western sentiment had won some favorable responses from Moscow and Peking, but neither Communist state had much of a stake in Uganda. Obote had purchased arms from China and Russia (and also Czechoslovakia), and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was providing some pilot training for the air force. General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has appeared to be intensely anti-Communist and has terminated Soviet assistance for the armed forces. He recently said, however, that he would welcome Soviet economic aid. If he cannot get the arms he wants from the West, he might even turn to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>34. In Kenya, both the Soviets and the Chinese are making steady, if unspectacular, progress in repairing the damage caused by their own past blunders. It is well known in Kenya that the Communist powers were at one time competing among themselves to support former Vice President Oginga Odinga, but Odingaʼs eclipse (after a series of confrontations with <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>) has in a sense freed the Communists from an albatross. The Soviets and Chinese have refrained lately from objectionable involvement in Kenyan politics, and the Kenyans have winked at disclosures of their past malpractices. Nevertheless, the Kenyan Government still restricts the movement of Communist personnel and is privately more suspicious of them than its public utterances would suggest.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>35. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> still maintains the most active interest in East Africa of any Western country, though even that is declining. Kenya is the linchpin of British involvement, largely because of the concentration of British investment <pb n="16" xml:id="d17-16" facs="d17-16"/>(over $130 million), expatriates, and military and political ties there. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is also concerned about Soviet naval activities in the Indian Ocean. Yet, even if violence were to break out once again in Kenya, the British would probably not introduce troops in an effort to restore order. The British would have more logistical problems bringing in troops today than they did in 1964, and British public opinion would be far less inclined to endorse this kind of intervention anyway. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is much more likely to continue to work quietly behind the scenes to try to influence the direction of Kenyan politics.</p>
                        <p>36. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was initially delighted with Oboteʼs overthrow in Uganda, and its quick recognition of the new regime probably helped to deter Tanzania from mounting a military operation against <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs subsequent behavior, however, has left the British with mixed feelings: pleasure that <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has moderated some of Oboteʼs nationalization programs, but concern about Aminʼs jingoism, excessive military spending, and his disruptive effect on East African regional affairs. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has turned down <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs more outlandish requests for military assistance against the Tanzanians and Chinese (e.g., mounting a naval blockade).</p>
                        <p>37. Neither the British nor the US Governments have much influence in Tanzania or Zambia these days. These regimes have nationalized most foreign holdings, and Zambia has a controlling interest in its copper industry. If Zambia should see advantages in changing the terms of settlement, it would not hesitate to do so. At this point, <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName>ʼs government seems satisfied. Both <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> proclaim non-alignment as the fundamental principle of their foreign policies, but this is often expressed in an anti-West fashion. Yet they want to maintain good relations with the West. This concern, plus thelack of many more foreign interests to nationalize, and the realization that there is no point in looking to the West for much assistance in the liberation of southern Africa, will probably combine to make for a less abrasive but also a looser relationship with the West in the long run.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">V. OUTLOOK</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>38. As long as General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> remains in office in Uganda, relations with Tanzania will be strained. Some kind of detente or modus vivendi might be worked out, perhaps by way of high-level outside mediation. But the odds are against this kind of arranged settlement lasting very long. Both <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> are stubborn and quick to blow up each political squabble or border incident with self-righteous rhetoric. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> is an idealist and would not necessarily drop the discredited Obote because it is the reasonable thing to do. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> will continue to need foreign scapegoats to shore up his domestic political position. Yet neither president appears to want any further escalation of hostilities. They are both probably aware of potential problems with their armies and unwilling to risk the uncertainties that would accompany military adventures on a larger scale.</p>
                        <p>39. A prolonged period of hostility between Tanzania and Uganda would have seriously adverse effects on the functioning of the EAC. Even in the best of circumstances, it will be difficult to revive the spirit of compromise and accommodation to gain common objectives. There is still a potential for community development, but no sign of the impetus to give it life. Uganda and Tanzania are in dire economic straits, especially in terms of foreign exchange, and both governments will be acting in their own <pb n="17" xml:id="d17-17" facs="d17-17"/>economic self-interest. The better-off Kenyans feel that they have been subsidizing their poor neighbors for years, and have received little tangible benefit in return. Increased Tanzanian purchases from China, in connection with the Tan/Zam Railroad arrangements, will reduce imports from Kenya. <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> seems to look to a continuation of current economic ties with Uganda, but to no new concessions or favors for Tanzania. Despite these unfavorable trends, the EAC is likely to be useful to the three members and to go on providing certain basic services.</p>
                        <p>40. No matter what happens to the EAC, relations between Tanzania and Zambia will probably become closer. For example, the common fear of military assaults from the south may lead to modest cooperation in security matters. But the relationship between Tanzania and Zambia is not without its own strains and problems. Zambian officials are concerned about the inability of the port of Dar es Salaam to handle even its current traffic. The construction of five new berths, now underway, will ease the problem some-what, but it is doubtful that the port facilities will be sufficient to handle the two million tons of goods expected to pass through upon completion of the Tan/Zam Railroad. More-over, Zambian officials have made it clear that they do not want to become dependent on any one route to the sea. Thus, Zambia will have to use the ports of Beira in Mozambique and Lobito in Angola, even after completion of the Tan/Zam Railroad.</p>
                        <p>41. The political and economic ties between Tanzania and its northern neighbors have been deteriorating for some time. The new links with Zambia are being consolidated in several ways. Nevertheless, the new relationships of states in the area are very much dependent on the character and inclinations of the rulers in each country. Another drastic change of regime in any of them along thelines of the coup in Uganda might rescramble relations. Emotionalism, racialism, and nationalism will probably continue to influence the foreign policies of East African states more than ideology or alignments with the major powers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">B. Political Stability</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>42. In Kenya, political tensions will persist, at least until the issue of succession to <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> is settled. The Kikuyu will try to hold onto the reins of power. This will cause wide-spread unrest and perhaps major tribal violence. According to the constitution, Vice President Moi, a member of a minor tribe but closely associated with <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>ʼs inner circle, would inherit the Presidency for 90 days until a parliamentary election could be held. But the army could step in at any time and probably would do so if tribal disorder seemed to be spreading. Tribal divisions within the army, however, would limit its effectiveness in this role and perhaps lead to bloodshed along Ugandan lines. <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>ʼs successor is certain to have more difficulty then <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> in coping with tribal and regional differences.</p>
                        <p>43. Uganda is a very difficult country to govern. General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> will probably be unable to survive in office for very long. He lacks the political skills necessary to hold together a quarrelsome and violent set of tribes; he lacks administrative talents as well. The army is likely to remain the dominant force in the land, but internal divisions and rivalries will persist. Coup attempts are possible from any of a number of factions, including Acholi tribesmen, junior officers, and the Baganda. The only sure thing for the foreseeable future is the continuation of disorder throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>44. In Tanzania, <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">JULIUS NYERERE</persName>ʼs main source of power lies in the support of the people for his position as the national leader <pb n="18" xml:id="d17-18" facs="d17-18"/>and “teacher.” Nevertheless, despite the high esteem in which he is held by his countrymen, the people of Tanzania have never been very enthusiastic about his programs. This does not mean that we expect a popular uprising. Tanzanians are more likely simply to ignore exhortations or to grumble as they are adversely affected by his schemes. But, if the army threatened to unseat Nyerere, there would be little movement to support him. The army might seek to oust Nyerere if it felt threatened by the rival Peopleʼs Militia, Chinese influence, or witch hunts. Other moderate elements in the civil service, political elite, and business community would probably welcome a change. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName>ʼs position will become less secure if the economy continues to suffer from his rash moves or if he embarks on repressive measures to enforce his nation-building efforts.</p>
                        <p>45. In Zambia, President <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> will have some difficulty in persuading Bembas to co-operate with his government, but there is no immediate threat to <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> as national leader. He retains the respect and affection of most influential Zambians, including the recently Zambianized army forces. His chief problems will continue to revolve around keeping open several routes to the sea and warding off retaliation by southern African white regimes for actions by freedom fighters. Yet, tribal tensions are normally very close to the surface, and can easily be brought to the flash-point. Zambian political institutions, including the ruling party, are in a rudimentary stage of development. Hence a change in regime could come quite abruptly.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">C. Implications for External Powers</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>46. It appears that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not greatly interested in East Africa and foresees few favorable opportunities there. The Chinese, on the other hand, already have some influence in Tanzania (mainland and Zanzibar) and the potential for developing considerably more. Their extensive military assistance to ground, naval, and air elements of the Tanzanian armed forces, their economic aid pro-gram, and their support for African liberation movements contribute to this influence. More-over, <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> and a few other high officials are favorably impressed by Chinese methods and attitudes. If the Chinese continue to per-form quietly and effectively, they are likely to improve further their position in Tanzania and to develop their influence in Zambia. But the Chinese will be dealing with hypersensitive Africans quick to react to any interference in their internal affairs. Though the Tanzanians may continue to rely on Chinese military assistance, the value to China of the economic assistance program is almost certain to decrease after completion of the Tan/Zam Railroad. Some Tanzanians are already complaining about high import prices of Chinese goods, their poor quality, and the difficulty of getting spare parts. This kind of complaint will probably grow as Chinese products be-come more plentiful on the local market.</p>
                        <p>47. East Africa has gradually loosened its ties with the West. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> still has the most important interest of any Western country, but its influence and concern have diminished over the years. The British will probably continue to work quietly behind the scenes in Kenya, but in the event of violence would probably not introduce troops. Elsewhere in East Africa, the British will seek to avoid involvement in political squabbles.</p>
                        <p>48. The significance for the US of developments in East Africa depends on what the US chooses to call important in the area. It can be argued that the US has no major interests in East Africa. The US depends on no East African products that it cannot obtain else-where. American investment is small compared to other parts of the underdeveloped world (no more than $200 million in Zambia, $100 million in Kenya, and $10 million each <pb n="19" xml:id="d17-19" facs="d17-19"/>in Uganda and Tanzania). On the other hand, the US has a stake in continued progress in the area. Kenyaʼs relatively open political atmosphere and economic prosperity are models which the US would like to see other countries follow. Tanzania and Zambia are frontline states in the confrontation between black and white areas of southern Africa, and Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> have been important leaders of world opinion on the African race problem. Changes in the leadership of these two states would certainly affect the southern African situation and, therefore, the US relationship with the area. The denial of landing or overflight rights in East Africa would re-quire considerable revision of US military contingency planning. Prolonged instability any-where in the area would jeopardize pro-West regimes, endanger existing regional arrangements, worsen prospects for economic development, and lead to the spread of violence in a volatile part of the Third World.</p>

                        <p>We owe it to ourselves and to Africa to define clearly and to state candidly American interests, aims and possibilities in the African Continent. We owe it to ourselves and to the Africans to understand clearly heir aims and priorities.</p>
                        <p>Our African diplomacy, including my own meetings these past three years with the leaders of 14 African nations, has been directed to the establishment of an honest relationship with the peoples and governments of the continent.</p>
                        <p>Africa is in its second decade of emancipation from colonial rule and the achievements of independent Africa have been impressive:

                        </p>
                        <p>Historically, U.S. interests derive from the many American citizens of African descent, and the long involvement of American churchmen, educators, and businessmen with Africa. In the last two decades, Africaʼs drive for independence stimulated our interest, and commanded our understanding and our support. The creation of new independent governments in Africa gave a new focus to our relationship and opened new opportunities for fruitful contacts between us. The special identification of black Americans with their African heritage adds intensity to our inherent interest in demonstrating that men of all races can live and prosper together.</p>
                        <p>One-third of the worldʼs independent nations are in Africa. Their voice and views are increasingly important in world affairs. Our global responsibilities require that we seek their understanding and diplomatic support for a wide range of policies.</p>
                        <p>In the economic sphere our common interests are substantial and growing. African leaders look to the United States for help primarily in meeting their development objectives. The American interest in a fruitful relationship with the African Continent commands that we, along with others, respond. On our part, we consider this an area particularly appropriate for an active U.S. role in African affairs. As African countries diversify their economic relationships, our own economic interests and opportunities in Africa expand. Our interest in African trade and investment opportunities matches the African interest in American goods and their desire for American technology.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">The Need for Mutual Respect and Restraint</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If these American interests in Africa provide a firm basis for relations of mutual benefit—and I believe they do—I am equally convinced that <pb n="4" xml:id="d18-04" facs="d18-04"/>both African and American interests are served by political restraint in our policy toward Africa.</p>
                        <p>We have made preeminently clear our respect for the diversity and independence of African nations. For historical and geographical reasons, Africa is resistant to involvement in alien conflicts and controversies. This accords with our purposes as well as Africaʼs. As Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> stated following his February 1970 trip to Africa:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We have no desire for any special influence in Africa except the influence that naturally and mutually develops among friends … we do not believe that Africa should be the scene of major power conflicts. We on our part do not propose to make it so.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>Restraint must be mutual to be effective. Non-African powers should not seek, nor Africans provide, opportunities for exploiting local conflicts. Africans have demonstrated, in their drive for autonomy and self-reliance, their ability to solve their problems without outside interference.</p>
                        <p>Mutual respect in relations with the United States also includes African recognition of our non-interference in African political affairs. We expect African nations to resist the temptation to serve domestic political purposes by making unsubstantiated charges of American interference in their affairs. Such charges appeared in a few places in Africa in 1971, particularly in Madagascar and Guinea.</p>
                        <p>American restraint accords with the natural pride of new nations molding their own future after generations of foreign rule. It is precisely what we demanded of others after we had obtained our own independence. The United States cannot, and will not, therefore, attempt to define Africaʼs goals, nor determine how they should be met. We will not recommend internal political arrangements to Africans--though we naturally prefer open and tolerant systems. But we can and we will support African commitments to the values we share.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">The Dimensions of Cooperation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The United States responded, in 1971, to the special and priority concerns of Africans. This Administration was able, even in the face of declining worldwide aid resources, to increase U.S. support for African development. Our development loans to African nations increased 30 percent and Export-Import Bank activity rose 140 percent. In addition, we provided almost 40 percent of the total cost of multilateral assistance programs in Africa. Last year the Peace Corps maintained 2,500 volunteers in 25 African countries, providing teacher training and vocational skills. American assistance to Africa totaled about $550 million last year, compared to $450 million in 1970.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d18-05" facs="d18-05"/>
                        <p>This record speaks for itself. We have been increasingly active in precisely that area in which Africa expects and wants an American contribution.</p>
                        <p>Private American investment in Africa is growing at an annual rate of 14 percent, a fact of the greatest promise for Africaʼs economic future. Private investment will undoubtedly play a major role in providing the Continent with the capital and technology it needs. We will continue to make every effort to encourage private investment in Africa. It will benefit not only Africa, but the world, to encourage efficient development of Africaʼs resources of petroleum, mineral, and agricultural products. American companies will also continue to help create new manufacturing enterprises and to facilitate expanded trade and tourism by working to build ports and railroads, air links and hotels.</p>
                        <p>U.S. private investment in Africa now totals about $3.5 billion, and continues to grow rapidly. Americans are participating in important new enterprises started last year in Nigeria and Zaire. The Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation stand ready to facilitate such ventures where our participation is wanted and where it can take place on a footing of mutual benefit. Africans who want this participation must, of course, create a hospitable climate for private investment. Kenya, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, and Zaire are examples of the benefits which flow from such a climate.</p>
                        <p>Our growing trade with Africa yielded the United States a 1971 trade surplus of about $400 million, while providing Africans with expanded markets for the exports so vital to their growth. 1971 saw the opening of our sugar market to Malawi and Uganda for the first time, and an in-crease in our quotas for Madagascar, Mauritius, and Swaziland. Despite our own economic difficulties, we exempted many African raw material exports from the temporary import surcharge imposed from August to December. We have announced our intention to submit to the Congress legislation to implement a system of generalized preferences for the exports of developing areas, including Africa. This year we will open in Nigeria our first Regional Trade Center in Africa. It should lead to a further expansion of African-American trade.</p>
                        <p>No oneʼs interest is served by underestimating the magnitude of the task ahead, or by exaggerating the contribution outsiders are able or willing to make to the realization of Africaʼs aspirations. The earlier era of euphoria is over. If Africa is to move ahead in the 1970ʼs, it must be largely on the basis of its own efforts and its own prescriptions. Assistance from others will supplement, but will not replace, the need for the application of major resources from the African nations themselves. There is <pb n="6" xml:id="d18-06" facs="d18-06"/>no need to hesitate in expressing that fact. Africans know it, and say it, for it has been a recurring theme in my many private discussions with African leaders.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">The Southern African Dilemma</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For more than a decade, leading Americans in all fields have expressed this nationʼs profound concern over racial injustice in southern Africa, and decried the serious potential of the issue for bringing large scale conflict to this region. As I have repeatedly made clear, I share the conviction that the United States cannot be indifferent to racial policies which violate our national ideals and constitute a direct affront to American citizens. As a nation, we cherish and have worked arduously toward the goal of equality of opportunity for all Americans. It is incumbent on us to support and encourage these concepts abroad, and to do what we can to forestall violence across international frontiers.</p>
                        <p>The United States can take pride in the measures it has taken to discourage a military buildup in the areas of minority rule. We have maintained our arms embargoes in those areas. We have stressed the need for self-determination in colonial areas. We have facilitated contact between the races, and underlined the fact that greater political and economic opportunity for Africans serves the true interests of all races. I detailed the steps we have taken in last yearʼs Report. It is a record second to none among the major powers.</p>
                        <p>Americans alone, however, cannot solve the racial problems of southern Africa. The notion that one nation, however powerful or well-intentioned, can master the most intractable issues plaguing foreign societies belongs to a past era.</p>
                        <p>For our part, we look toward black and white in Africa to play the primary role in working toward progress consistent with human dignity. We support their efforts by:
<list>
                                <item>—Encouraging communication between the races in Africa, and between African peoples and our own.</item>
                                <item>—Making known directly to the parties involved our views on their actions. My Administration will not condone recourse to violence, either as a means of enforcing submission of a majority to a minority or as a formula for effecting needed social change.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The situation today offers no grounds for complacency about the imminence of racial justice in southern Africa. It is, therefore, important that we continue to do everything we can to encourage respect for human dignity.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d18-07" facs="d18-07"/>
                        <p>In South Africa, men continue to be demeaned for reason of their race, and to be detained and harassed for their views about official policy But the outside world is witnessing with sober hope the suggestions of change inside South Africa, where questioning voices are being raised, examining both the premises and the results of that countryʼs policies, Private companies, many of them American, are considering new ways to open opportunities for African workers. There is an imbalance between the needs of South Africaʼs active economy and her adherence to racial policies which deprive her of the growing pool of human talent which that economy requires. There is some hope in that anomaly.</p>
                        <p>In Southern Rhodesia, after six years of economic sanctions designed to end the rebellion against Britain, Rhodesia and British negotiators reached agreement in November on the terms of a proposed settlement. These are now being put before the people of Rhodesia whose choice it is whether to accept or reject them. We hope this process will set Rhodesia on the path toward racial equality.</p>
                        <p>In the Portuguese territories, development in some areas is over-shadowed by guerrilla warfare and repression. By our words and actions, we have made clear our view that progress toward self-determination offers the best hope of a permanent and profitable Portuguese-African relationship.</p>
                        <p>In Namibia, South Africa continues to resist the efforts of the United Nations on behalf of self-determination. It rejects the 1971 holding of the International Court of Justice that South Africa is obliged to quit Namibia. We accept that holding and continue to discourage U.S. in-vestment in Namibia. We seek to encourage peaceful ways of realizing and protecting the rights of the people of Namibia.</p>
                        <p>Some call for the United States to take the prime responsibility for the racial problems of southern Africa. Some want the United States to force upon the minority governments of southern Africa immediate and, if need be, violent change. I have indicated why I reject that position. Southern Africa contains within itself the seeds of change. We can and will work with others to encourage that process.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="strong">Our Expanding Relations with Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a growing depth and breadth to our relations with the Continent. Today, the unprecedented frequency of personal contact between American and African leaders reflects that fact. I visited Africa four times before becoming President, and was able to study at first hand and in considerable detail the problems as well as the progress being achieved. <pb n="8" xml:id="d18-08" facs="d18-08"/>Since 1969, I have met personally with the leaders of 14 African states. Both Vice President Agnew and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> have made extensive visits to Africa and have had contacts with African leaders that have been invaluable in setting the course of our African policies. A very special event occurred in January when, for the first time, the wife of an American President visited Africa officially. I was deeply gratified at the warmth of her reception in Liberia, Ghana, and Ivory Coast.</p>
                        <p>These exchanges have enabled me to confirm that a policy based on economic support, political restraint, and mutual respect serves us well. It accords with the high priority African leaders place on developing their economies. It accords with Africaʼs desire to be free of foreign political influence and Africaʼs need to avoid the diversion of resources inevitable if conflict comes to the continent. Finally, it accords with the growing realization of Africaʼs leaders and people that their destiny is in their own hands, where they want it and where it should be.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> opened the discussion with a brief resume of the current Soviet posture on the continent by noting that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> long ago abandoned any romantic notions about making rapid gains in Africa. Although they have been able to achieve a degree of influence in some countries where Soviet and local interests have coincided, the Soviets too have suffered their share of failures and have encountered the same difficulties as the West--cultural differences, African nationalism, and conflicts of national interests. For the Soviets, the African picture is mixed. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has significant influence in Algeria--to which it has given considerable military and economic aid; but the Algerians are still at times difficult to handle. Qadhafiʼs Libya remains basically anti-Soviet in spite of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>ʼs pro-Arab policies. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> suffered a significant setback in Sudan, where even the persistent efforts of their Egyptian proteges have failed to rehabilitate them. The Soviets best position in East Africa is in Somalia, but they have made little progress elsewhere. In West Africa their efforts in <pb n="2" xml:id="d19-02" facs="d19-02"/>Nigeria during the civil war paid off no better than those of anyone else. The Soviets will continue to take advantage of the deterioration of western influence, and are going to find themselves more bedeviled by Chinese than by western competition.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Le Quesne suggested that perhaps a triangular competition will develop; to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added that we could very well find ourselves standing aside and observing a new cold war between the communist super-powers. He cited the number of instances of Soviet Ambassadors in Africa seeking out their American colleagues to voice complaints about Chinese activities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> agreed with the United States assessment generally and with that on Sudan and Nigeria specifically. The United Kingdom fully shares our opinion that the Soviets place naval requirements very high on their list of priori-ties. He cited Amilcar Cabralʼs attendance at the CPSU Congress as evidence that party contacts with the liberation movements were continuing, but inquired if the United States did not feel that Soviet influence in the African Liberation movements was being undermined by the Chinese. Mr <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> noted that even in Moscow Cabral had been very careful about his posture of neutrality on the Sino-Soviet quarrel. The Soviets are definitely playing second fiddle to the Chinese; but whether this is by intent we do not know.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d19-03" facs="d19-03"/>
                        <p>In response to Ambassador Le Quesneʼs comment that there had been no recent signal successes for the Soviets in Africa, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stated that he believed this was at least partially the result of the Sovietʼs placing only a low priority on all of Africa south and west of Ethiopia. Guinea, he said, had been a target of opportunity with which the Russians were now stuck. Ambassador Le Quesne suggested that the Sovietʼs sole important African penetration in Somalia was essentially but a duplication -- in terms of facilities and strategic location--of their position in Aden. To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, Somalia constitutes the most disturbing situation within his entire area of responsibility: our termination of aid there as a result of Somali shipping trade with North Viet Nam cannot be adequately justified to President SIAD and therefore leaves us with no choice but to stand aside while the Soviets try to solidify their position in this strategically important area.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>ʼs query as to whether the Soviets will attempt to recoup their position in Ghana; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that he considered it unlikely that they will make any major effort to do so: Ghana lacks strategic significance and the Soviets will be content merely to wait and see if an opportune situation develops. Ambassador Le Quesne acknowledged that Britain too lacked any indication of the Soviet attitude toward Ghanaʼs debt problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stated that we had no indication at present of any Soviet activity in the TFAI, although the North Koreans and Chinese are believed to be fishing in these muddy waters. In response to the Ambassadorʼs question about Tanzania, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that we had no evidence yet of any attempt by the Soviets to counter Chinese influence there and added that, even in Uganda, there was no indication of any effort by the Soviets to recoup their situation since the downfall of Obote. These comments prompted Ambassador Le Quesne to observe that the Soviets must be pretty disillusioned with Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> agreed, except with respect to the Horn. When Ambassador Le Quesne suggested that perhaps the real Soviet interest lay in Ethiopia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> asserted that he is convinced that their particular interest is in the waterways of the area.</p>

In West Africa the PRC is deemphasizing subversion in the interest of establishing diplomatic relations with existing governments and appears willing to use foreign aid here too as a means to achieve this end. It can be <pb n="2" xml:id="d20-02" facs="d20-02"/>expected that China will select “emphasis countries” in distributing its assistance. The Manantali Dam project in Mali may be an example of this, although there is nothing firm to date in spite of both governmentsʼ expressed interest. PRC aid in East Africa has totalled $675 million (Ethiopia, Somalia, Zambia, Tanzania) and only four countries--Pakistan, Somalia, Tanzania and Zambia--have recieved two-thrids of all Chinese foreign aid funding.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> represented the view of <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> Sinologues that there has been a change only in Chinese tactics. The Chinese long ago cited Africa as the center of the struggle against imperialism, and the strategy based on their thesis of gaining control of the underdeveloped “countryside” of the world so as to isolate the industrialized “cities” remains unchanged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> observed that it is through turmoil that the Chinese see the means of creating situations in which they are most likely to have a strong influence in African nations.</p>
                        <p>“Chairman Mauʼs revolutionary diplomatic policy” now aims at having relations with all states rather than close alliances only with radical states. The United Kingdom stresses the Chinese progress toward this goal in West Africa as the initial phase of their long-range strategy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> foresees a future Chinese presence in West Africa resembling their current presence in East Africa--if they are successful in their efforts. Ambassador Le Quesne sees Nigeria as Chinaʼs prime target in West Africa, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> noted that the Nigerians have so far displayed commendable caution in their dealings with the PRC. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs observation that the Chinese had an advantage in being able to respond quickly to African requests for assistance, whereas we were inhibited in our responses by numerous restrictions and regulations; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> noted that the Chinese were notably successful in keeping control of their aid projects and in avoiding outright budgetary support which would give the Africans direct control of Chinese resources.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Le Quesne stressed the British view that the Chinese are presently in the period of deployment in Africa and that it is difficult to foresee precisely their next move. In response to Mr. Smithʼs question, he offered the opinion that Chinaʼs aims were primarily at present political: the establishment of political influence through economic measures in order eventually to deny areas and their resources to the West and place them at Chinaʼs disposal.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d20-03" facs="d20-03"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> asked rhetorically if the Chinese were not now at the stage of rethinking their goals. He noted that they had been successful in achieving U.N. membership, internal respectability, etc., and with such greatly widened opportunities they are going to have to think now in terms of priorities. Previously, with a mere handful of countries in which they were able to operate, they had little problem in finding resources for their undertakings. Ambassador Le Quesne concurred that Chinaʼs short-term objectives had been achieved. He noted that whereas only one-tenth of the Soviet Unionʼs foreign aid had been devoted to Africa, fully one-half of Chinaʼs aid had gone to the continent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> viewed this comparison as misleading, for the Chinese had previously had little leeway in choosing recipients of its aid. Where else could it have gone if not to Africa? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> noted that more recent Chinese offers of aid (Sierra Leone and Ethiopia) had come just prior to the vote on U.N. membership, and the question was now how much new aid would actually be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Smith sees Chinaʼs goal not as world hegemony, but as the building-up of China as a powerful industrial state--which makes her interest in Africa in economic terms similar to that of Japan. Mr. Petrie noted the Chinese effort to distinguish themselves from the Soviet Union; citing their non-vote on the Argentine Resolution on Namibia at the Addis Ababa <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> meeting as being aimed at placing themselves in a position to be the residual beneficiary of the upheavals which they foresee in Africaʼs future.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs query as to the implications of this for our policy direction, Ambassador Le Quesne emphasized that the Soviet threat in Africa has proven to have been much less formidable than we had expected a decade ago. Russian techniques have not been very successful, and have included many examples of outright ineptitude. The question is whether Chinese techniques are going to prove to be a greater threat, and Ambassador Le Quesne fears that they will be. Whereas the Soviet Union in African eyes is not dissimilar from the West--in that it too is essentially a white European industrial power and has in its activities in Africa largely dealt through existing governments in conventional ways; the Chinese have an entirely different image with which it is much easier for the Africans to identify--less <pb n="4" xml:id="d20-04" facs="d20-04"/>pretentious and ostentatious, more on the order of that of the Peace Corps. Ambassador Le Quesne sees little choice for us other than to continue as we are, while attempting to do things more effectively.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> wondered if China still does intend to bring about revolution in African countries in general and not just in southern Africa, cannot we in some way convey this idea to the Africans so as to alert them to the danger? Ambassador Le Quesne fears that the Africans may make the mistake of thinking that they can deal with China on the same terms that they have dealt with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Mr. McConville noted that Portuguese colonial policy denies dissidence any recourse but to appeal to the Chinese for assistance. Ambassador Le Quesne observed however, that those Africans who have actually visited China find the Chinese much too somber and dour and readily admit that their style does not appeal to the African temperament. This may be so, cautioned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, but the Africans may still find the Chineseʼ modest and efficient ways of doing business very much to their liking even if they do not favor the Chinese way of life. Ambassador Le Quesne also foresees difficulties for the Chinese inherent in their attempt to build themselves up as the champion of small countries opposed to big power hegemony, while at the same time striving to make China a great industrial power the equal of the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> expressed doubt that there was any cause for concern if the PRC was really providing solid economic assistance needed by the African countries. Ambassador Le Quesne, however, sees dangers, in that such assistance is based upon ulterior motives aimed at specific long-range political objectives inimical to the West. He noted that the Tanzam Railroad was undoubtedly aimed toward strengthening Chinese influence on the periphery of white-ruled Southern Africa--with the Republic of South Africa the ultimate objective. He again cited Nigeria as Chinaʼs principle long range concern in West Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> stuck to his opinion that we had overly concerned ourselves with the Russian threat, and should avoid doing so over the Chinese threat; which prompted Ambassador Le Quesne to reiterate that China was only in the deployment phase at this time, and that we cannot complacently assure ourselves that Chinese techniques are to be the same and no more successful than those of the <pb n="5" xml:id="d20-05" facs="d20-05"/>Russians. Mr. Smith cited the example of Chinaʼs simultaneous aid to Ethiopia and Somalia as a situation which was bound to create a conflict for the Chinese and could not continue indefinitely; and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> noted that the Chinese are handicapped by a rigidity arising from their zealous adherence to the dogma of Maoism--the true faith.</p>
                        <p>All that we can really attempt to do, Ambassador Le Quesne concluded, is to warn the Africans that they should deal with the Chinese with an even “longer spoon” than they use in dealing with the Russians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> remarked that his recent contacts with the Zambians and Tanzanians indicate that they are beginning to worry about the Chinese presence: it is they who now frequently raise this subject in conversation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> observed that we should not be too forward about this subject, but limit ourselves to appropriate responses when the Africans bring it up. There was unanimous agreement with Mr. McConvilleʼs observation that the Chinese were the worldʼs most arrogant, racist, and ethnocentric people; but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> warned that we should not overlook African sympathy and appreciation for the sympathetic Chinese response to African concern and frustration over the southern African situation. Although our southern African policy places us in a very disadvantageous situation which the Chinese are bound to exploit to the fullest, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> nevertheless expects the Africans to prove as monumentally ungrateful to the Chinese as they have been to others. Ambassador Le Quesne agreed that this might very well be correct, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> did not agree that this would be the case in the southern African periphery. He also noted that, whereas we see the solution in a softening of repressive policies by South Africa and Portugal, these two countries tend to see the solution in terms of more of the same. It was agreed that this situation constitutes our gravest danger and challenge as long as the Chinese and the Africans appear to have a community of interest contrary to that of the West.</p>
                        <p>In turning to the subject of China and the United Nations, Ambassador Le Quesne wondered if “non-participation” was perhaps a new Chinese tactical ploy. Mr. Petrie feels that it is not--that it is merely a reflection of the fact that the Chinese have not yet had time to formulate their positions on some issues before the United Nations; to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added that they were possibly also evidencing a desire to disassociate themselves from policies and actions taken at the United Nations prior to their own arrival. Mr. Petrie <pb n="6" xml:id="d20-06" facs="d20-06"/>suggested that we should not be overly concerned about the overblown Chinese attacks on the West. He felt that such exaggerated and vitriolic harangues often backfired by creating sympathy rather than animosity in the General Assembly, and could very well lead to the abstentions which we often seek.</p>

                        <p>After welcoming Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, Secretary-General Alphand said that he wished to outline the principal problems which the French side thought warranted further examination. During the past few months, he continued, Africa has had no major conflicts and has enjoyed “a certain stability.” Yet Africa is moving and developing rapidly, and bears close attention.</p>
                        <p>For all African governments, M. Alphand noted, the top priority is development and improvement in the living standards of their peoples. Unfortunately, the gap between the developed and underdeveloped <pb n="2" xml:id="d21-02" facs="d21-02"/>countries is growing and is a subject of serious preoccupation for both. The <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> Conference in Santiago, which is currently discussing this problem, finds the US and France in general agreement, though we differ in our approach -- for example, in the greater emphasis placed by the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> on market and price stabilization for primary products. If we can in fact arrive at a common position on these issues, this would mark a major contribution to African development. In this connection, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into the EC recalls the importance attached by France to the maintenance of “certain privileges” for the associated states, which France believes to be in the interests both of these countries and of the West.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the role of the “Socialist countries” in Africa, M. Alphand remarked that their effort has generally not been successful in Africa, though the PRC has recently made more head-way than the Soviets. The rivalry between the two Communist powers has hurt them both, as has the tendency among African countries to view them both in practical terms as potential aid sources rather than in terms of ideology. There has been some “tendency” toward the Communist countries in such states as Mali, Congo-Brazzaville, and perhaps Mauritania, M. Alphand observed, but Communist influence is nowhere dominant.</p>
                        <p>In Black Africa, the Secretary General said, there have been both positive and negative developments recently. On the positive side, he cited (a) <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName>ʼs visit to Namibia and the resultant opening of communications with South Africa, even though long-term results are still unknown: (b) the agreement ending the civil war in southern Sudan; and (c) the Chad/Libya agreement, hopefully ending a situation in which Frolinat propaganda from Libya risked serious degeneration in Chad. On the negative side, M. Alphand listed (a) the probable negative report of the Pearce Commission on Rhodesia, leaving us all in a very difficult situation; (b) the ouster of Busia in Ghana, which the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> “deplored” since Busia had restored democratic rule in the country and since the coup did nothing to improve the countryʼs serious economic and financial problems; and (c) the withdrawal of Zaire from <gloss target="#t_OCAM1">OCAM</gloss>, a useful structure for African cooperation which benefited from the presence of this large and rich member.</p>
                        <p>In North Africa, M. Alphand continued, there are problems within each of the countries of the region, though they have recently moved closer together and thus removed the shadow of certain problems which loomed a few months ago. Throughout the area, the French noted a new interest in Mediterranean security and increased attention to European plans in this regard.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d21-03" facs="d21-03"/>
                        <p>Taking the region on a country-by-country basis, M. Alphand said the French judged the situation in <hi rend="underline">Morocco</hi> to be “very bad.” The King was once again backing and filling, creating general uncertainty. Nevertheless, French-Moroccan relations remained good, despite the ever-present threat of further nationalizations by the GOM of French-owned land. <hi rend="underline">Tunisia</hi> was facing its own internal difficulties in the aftermath of the Ben Salah affair and the uncertainties of Bourguiba’s health. The President no longer rules as once he did, and recently has seemed to waver in his backing of Prime Minister Nouira. Again, however, bilateral French relations with Tunisia are excellent, and both economic and cultural assistance have been increased. <hi rend="underline">Libya</hi> appears stronger internally than its neighbors, but for the first time there have been signs of opposition to a regime considered by some to be too dictatorial. Relations with France are good, with trade up and the Mirage contract proceeding normally. The principal motivation of LARG policy, in French eyes, is anti-Zionism, and the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> sees this as a significant element of Libyan action vis-a-vis Chad “where Israel had a certain influence.” In <hi rend="underline">Algeria</hi>, Boumediene is clearly in charge, though he faces a number of economic problems. The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> believes the Algerians regret not having accepted the French package offer conveyed to them over a year ago by Secretary-General Alphand (and which will not be repeated), but they have considerable domestic resources with which to work. French-Algerian relations are “not too bad,” with the outstanding <hi rend="underline">contentieux</hi> balanced by cooperation in various fields and French willingness to discuss Mediterranean security problems with the GOA.</p>
                        <p>Replying to M. Alphand, Ambassador <hi rend="underline">Watson</hi> recalled that the present consultations are the third in the current series of formal exchanges on African problems and expressed appreciation for the warm welcome extended by the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>. The Ambassador noted the wide measure of agreement we have found over the past few years in comparing our assessments of African developments, and theprogress which has been made in developing joint aid projects. He then turned to Assistant Secretary Newsom for an overview of Africa as seen by the USG.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="underline">Newsom</hi> opened by reiterating the respect and admiration of the United States for French positions in Africa, The contribution made by France to development and stability on the continent, he said, is one for which all western nations should be grateful. This is one reason why we attach such high value to our consultations with the <pb n="4" xml:id="d21-04" facs="d21-04"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> and are so pleased by the excellent relations which prevail between our representatives both in Paris and in the field. He himself, Mr. Newsom noted, has now visited all but two of the independent nations of Africa, and in many countries has greatly appreciated the opportunity to exchange views with French Ambassadors and advisers.</p>
                        <p>We have no basic areas of disagreement with M. Alphand’s overview, the Assistant Secretary said, so he proposed to outline US preoccupations and interests. In recent meetings with American Ambassadors in Kinshasa and Addis Ababa, Mr. Newsom observed, the prevailing impression had been one of progress despite the problems faced by African governments. We thus remain optimistic about the ability of the Africans to solve their problems and maintain their independence.</p>
                        <p>Our initial concern, the Assistant Secretary continued, is to <hi rend="underline">maintain satisfactory relations</hi> with all the independent countries of Africa i.e., an adequate level of diplomatic exchanges, equitable access to trade and investment opportunities, and transit rights. We seek to project our interest in these states, our respect for their independence, and our desire to help them to the maximum extent our resources permit. There are some particularly difficult cases in this regard. <hi rend="underline">Algeria</hi> appears to be turning away from past dogmatism and emotionalism toward greater pragmatism, both with regard to its own development and to the Middle East, and to be showing more interest in the Maghreb. In <hi rend="underline">Guinea</hi>, considerations of our substantial investment stake and the desirability of preserving a western presence have led us to keep a mission and to seek the best possible relations. We have slowed down the arrival of a new Ambassador, and have hopefully stirred some concern thereby within the GOG which will prove beneficial to our own relations and to relations between Guinea and the West generally. With <hi rend="underline">Equatorial Guinea</hi>, our relations have survived the recent tragedy involving our personnel in Santa Isabel, in which the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> and French representatives in the field were so helpful. With <hi rend="underline">Congo-Brazzaville</hi>, there has simply been no progress toward restoration of relations, and it seems evident Ngouabi is not yet ready to take this step.</p>
                        <p>Our second concern in Africa, Mr. Newsom said, is to be <hi rend="underline">responsive to the African preoccupation with economic development.</hi> This, as M. Alphand noted, is Africa’s top priority and the first thing their leaders raise in talking to us. We have problems with Congress on our AID legislation, and may be led to some changes in emphasis and perhaps reduction in personnel. But we must continue to play a role, and in fact our aid to Africa has not dropped but has remained constant at about $550 million/year in total resource transfers since <pb n="5" xml:id="d21-05" facs="d21-05"/>1968. (This includes not only <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained, but also Peace Corps, PL-480, long-term Exlm credits, and $200 million made available through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>.) We attach great importance to the creation of African institutions through which funds can be transferred, and this is one reason we have worked with the Entente, AFDB, and <gloss target="#t_OCAM1">OCAM</gloss>. With regard to the last-named, we regret the withdrawal of Zaire, and also regret rumors suggesting incorrectly that we were in some way involved. We are not, of course, in any way responsible for the twists and turns of Mobutuʼs impulses. As the Secretary-General observed, the Africans are concerned not only with aid but also with sure markets and prices for their products. We have serious Congressional problems in this regard, but the Senate has ratified the coffee agreement and the USG takes a positive attitude on a possible cocoa accord. With regard to reverse preferences, we understand the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> position and this will undoubtedly be a subject of continuing discussion between our two governments.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet and Chinese role in Africa, the Assistant Secretary said, is our third major area of concern. We have told the Africans that this is essentially their own business, and that we do not want to perpetuate the cold war in Africa. We do not intend to base our own relations with Africa on African relations with the Soviets or PRC, and we have considerable confidence in the ability of the Africans to preserve their independence. The Soviets, in recent months, have made some progress in Arab Africa and the Horn, but not much in Black Africa; and even in Arab Africa, they have run afoul of Qaddafiʼs militant anti-Communism. There have been signals that General SIAD in Somalia is unhappy about the burden of Soviet military aid, and this may merit closer attention. The Chinese have adopted an approach different from that which characterized their earlier efforts in Africa. They are seeking to present a respectable image, are avoiding contact with dissident movements, and are emphasizing economic cooperation. Their economic activities are not a cause for immediate concern, but bear watching. More worrisome is their presence in military establishments (notably in Tanzania) and their growing identification with southern African liberation movements.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said, we are concerned at the complex of problems in southern Africa. In South Africa itself, the USG has supported realistic change by seeking, for example, to open communications between elements in the U.S. and various communities within South Africa and by urging U.S. firms to improve labor conditions for their non-white employees. We distinguish carefully between our own imperatives with regard to US-South African communications and the question of dialogue between South Africa and Black Africa, leaving <pb n="6" xml:id="d21-06" facs="d21-06"/>the latter entirely to the Black Africans to decide. We have indicated our view that better relations seem to us essential to peace and stability on the continent, but the means to this end must be chosen by the Africans themselves. With regard to Rhodesia, we will continue to enforce sanctions on the 86% of US-Rhodesian trade which is still covered by the program, and we hope for success in an effort now underway to repeal the Byrd amendment which permits importation of Rhodesian chrome. As for Namibia, we too welcomed the trip made by <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName>. We now face a very delicate situation in keeping open for him the opportunity to continue his new dialogue with the <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>, since the Africans in New York may press for tougher positions which would make further exchanges impossible. We hope the momentum can be maintained, though we expect no major immediate results.</p>
                        <p>In closing, the Assistant Secretary mentioned three other areas which he felt warranted further attention in the remainder of the consultations: (a) following up Deputy Assistant Secretary Smithʼs talks on the Ghana debt problem (Paris 7182), he reemphasized the serious implications of failure to resolve this long-standing situation; (b) the Horn of Africa, to which he had already made reference in connection with Soviet aid (above); and (c) North Africa, where we too sense a greater feeling of Maghrebian common action, if not unity, and share French concern over the growing malaise in Morocco.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">1. Ghana</p>
                        <p>The military regime is in control, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> noted, and has no current opposition, but is still drifting in its policy and basic orientations. It is-just beginning to assert its control over the bureaucracy and the para-statal companies, but is still living on ad hoc decision-making and has no long-term economic plan. Imports have recently been brought under full licensing, which may result in some food shortages, and the debt problem -- reviewed with the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> recently by Deputy Assistant Secretary Smith (Paris 7182) -- remains acute. We are concerned over the possible dangers inherent in continued drifting by the regime and the risk of radical and unpredictable actions if there is no international resolution of the debt problem. In connection with the latter, we see no solution acceptable to the NRC other than under <pb n="2" xml:id="d22-02" facs="d22-02"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> auspices and dealing with both debts and the countryʼs basic economic needs, and we hope the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> can agree to this approach. US assistance will continue, though the level is likely to be somewhat lower than in past because of the current situation.</p>
                        <p>M. Rebeyrol commented that the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> also attaches great importance to the role of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, but added that the Bank appears to move very slowly. M. Carraud observed that agreement had been reached for a joint IBRD/<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> mission, which had perhaps already left for Ghana. The link between aid and debts, he said, which the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> wishes to avoid, is somewhat theoretical for France because of its very small bilateral aid program. The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> is, however, keenly aware of the importance of doing something for the NRC in order to hold it to a basically western orientation. The French share our judgment of the NRCʼs erratic behavior, but this only reenforces French consciousness of their need for aid. The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> sees no alternative to the NRC at present, though some criticism of its performance and defense of Busiaʼs record has begun to appear.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">2. Nigeria</p>
                        <p>We see no sign of any immediate challenge to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said, though it faces a multiplicity of problems -- including administrative disorganization, unemployment, inflation, overcentralization of decision-making, and corruption. The reconciliation after the civil war was dramatic and the country seems to be facing the new problems of development. Growing petroleum revenues have bolstered the power of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> over the states. The country is now financially solvent, though developmental problems remain. On the external side, Nigeria is beginning to feel its strength and seeking to play a role in Africa. Thus far, it has given priority in use of its revenues to its massive domestic needs, though the loans to Dahomey suggest the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> may be taking a new direction in this regard.</p>
                        <p>US relations with Nigeria are satisfactory, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> continued, though there are a few scars remaining from what the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> considered to be our ambivalent attitude during the civil war. The Nigerians show a high degree of sensitivity over southern African issues, more so than anywhere else except one or two countries in East Africa. We will hear more and more about Nigeria on the African scene, the Assistant Secretary concluded, and no one will have any special relationship with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d22-03" facs="d22-03"/>
                        <p>M. Carraud echoed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs judgment of the importance to be attached to the Nigerian emergence on the African scene. He noted that French interests in Nigeria are important, and that Peugeot will be building an assembly plant near Kaduna. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, he said, has taken a firm but careful approach to the problem of Nigerianization, moving steadily toward its goals but avoiding any abrupt nationalizations. M. Rebeyrol added that French-Nigerian relations are relatively satisfactory despite some unfavorable memories from the recent past. The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> hopes its current negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> over terms for a French loan can be brought to a rapid conclusion.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">3. Equatorial Guinea</p>
                        <p>This is a one-man country, M. Carraud observed, and Maciasʼ behavior defies Cartesian analysis. He is unpredictable. He has alienated his country from Spain even though the latter continues to supply an important part of his budget, and has welcomed the Soviets, Chinese, and other Communists though their influence is hard to measure. These latter may be useful to Macias largely as props for his effort to keep the Fang on top in the local political hierarchy. The French Embassy remains on the spot, largely to provide some western alternative for the GOEG. French aid is extremely limited, largely because offers of technical assistance and of ASECNA membership have not been answered. The French have sold a helicopter to the GOEG, which is just arriving with a French crew. M. Rebeyrol added that Macias has a pathological, almost neurotic, suspicion of foreigners, especially whites, which creates problems for the Communists as well as for the West in their dealings with the GOEG. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> noted that we no longer have any personnel permanently stationed in Equatorial Guinea, but rely on regular visits from Yaounde. The question of returning a permanent presence to Santa Isabel remains under study in Washington.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">4. Horn of Africa</p>
                        <p>Reviewing the situation in the Horn, M. Carried saw little change in the Ethiopian political picture. The Emperor remains on top, and the succession remains the principal question. The Emperorʼs role in helping with the southern Sudan settlement is seen by the French to have served his own interest as well because of the parallels with the situation in Eritrea. The Ethiopians are concerned at a reported buildup of the Somali army, but the French feel this threat has been exaggerated.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d22-04" facs="d22-04"/>
                        <p>Soviet influence in Somalia, which frightens the Ethiopians, is limited both by Somali incapacity to absorb resources and technical assistance and by limits on Soviet interest. The French do not believe the Soviets are interested in provoking a serious clash between Ethiopia and, Somalia, and see the Somali army -- which they estimate at between 15, 000 and 25, 000 -- as representing no significant threat.</p>
                        <p>Somali intentions with regard to the TFAI are not clear, M. Carraud continued. Their public statements differ considerably from their private assurances to the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>, but the French are not inclined to dramatize the situation. The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> doubts the Somalis want to push the situation too hard, and the French are in general not especially pessimistic about prospects for the Horn.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> pointed out that the major USG interest in the Horn is in Ethiopia, which continues to receive 70% of our total grant military aid to Africa. The Emperor was alarmed at the prospects of a cut in this aid, which will not now be as severe as had initially been feared, which he may have believed related to a parallel reduction of 40% in our personnel strength at Kagnew and thus interpreted as a lessening of US interest in Ethiopia. We have assured him, however, that neither cut is intended to signal any lessening of US interest in, or support for, Ethiopia, and we believe the Emperor is now satisfied.</p>
                        <p>The internal situation in Ethiopia appears to us to be reasonably good. Should the Emperor disappear suddenly from the scene, we believe the Crown Prince would probably succeed constitutionally. The real test would then be his ability to wield effective power.</p>
                        <p>We have been intrigued by recent signals from Somalia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> continued, the validity of which is still hard to assess. Our new Ambassador has been warmly received and has had two long talks with General SIAD, and the Somali Ambassador in Washington has been delivering an equally cordial message with great stress on economic development. SIAD has suggested that he is finding Soviet military aid a heavy financial burden on Somalia and may want to cut it back, and is thus exploring permanent detente with Ethiopia as an alternative means of dealing with Somaliaʼs security problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said he had discussed this development in Addis Ababa with the Emperor, the Prime Minister, and the Foreign Minister, all of whom took a very hard line. While SIAD is making friendly noises, they say, he is rewriting Somali schoolbooks to include irredentist claims. The Emperor <pb n="5" xml:id="d22-05" facs="d22-05"/>said in private talks, however, that he finds SIAD personally honest and sincere, and that he will turn his personal attention to Somalia once the Sudanese situation is settled. He added that he hopes to see SIAD in Rabat at the June summit meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. The Emperor stressed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> that Ethiopia cannot cede any territory, but the Foreign Minister spoke in a separate exchange of possible “adjustments.” We do not want to get into the middle of this in any way, and feel it is not yet possible to make any realistic appraisal of the prospects for eventual settlement.</p>

                            <item>Throughout more than eight years of direct relations between Nigeria and US, USG has consistently supported concept of Nigerian unity. As is known within <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, USG tried in critical months of April and May 1967 to persuade the then military governor of Eastern Region and his associates to seek peaceful solution of their differences with rest of country within framework of one Nigeria. USG deplored secession when it came, has since given neither encouragement nor support to secessionists, and continues to desire a peaceful settlement of Nigerian crisis negotiated by Nigerians themselves in context of single Nigeria.</item>

                            <item>This basic policy of USG in respect of Nigerian crisis has since out break of civil war been paralleled by another policy, deeply rooted in American tradition, of providing assistance to civilian victims of warfare, a commonly accepted obligation of all nations. USG has accordingly since early 1968 provided assistance in various forms to Nigerian National Rehabilitation Commission, Nigerian Red Cross, <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and private voluntary relief agencies for relief of civilian victims of Nigerian civil war wherever located.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>The USG does not believe that its decision to sell cargo aircraft to American relief agencies and the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> for relief purposes should adversely affect relations between Nigeria and the US. Responsive to humanitarian requirements, this decision represents no change in well-known USG policy towards Nigeria and the USG has so emphasized publicly. Its sole purpose in providing these aircraft, which it no longer requires, is to expand the relief airlift to Ex civilian victims in the secessionist area, It cannot agree, as suggested in the Ministryʼs note, that the provision of these aircraft increases the arms-carrying capacity of the secessionists. The agencies acquiring them have undertaken to cooperate with the USG in establishing workable procedures to ensure that aircraft are engaged solely in carrying relief supplies. USG is confident that in these circumstances the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will take every precaution to assure that these and other humanitarian aircraft are effectively safeguarded from any possibility of hostile action by Nigerian armed forces.</item>

                            <item>USG continues to believe that, short of a peaceful settlement of the civil war, only the establishment of land or water corridors and daylight flights can adequately meet the problem of civilian relief in the secessionist area. It has made this clear to the secessionists and will continue to urge them to agree to such arrangements.</item>

                                    <item>The Ministry stated that USG has paid over 80 percent of the cost of relief efforts of Caritas and the World Council of Churches. The USG has supplied food for civilian victims of the civil war on both sides of the line, wherever they could be reached, through the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, UNICEF and voluntary agencies and it has borne the freight costs for transportation of this food. In addition it has made cash contributions to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. It has made no cash contributions to voluntary agencies.</item>

                                    <item>Students from secessionist territory who applied for entry into US from Portugal were invited to US by American National Studentsʼ Association. USG traditionally follows liberal policy with regard to travel of foreigners in US. Travel documents issued by secessionist authorities to these students were neither visaed nor otherwise recognized.</item>

                                    <item>As regards concern expressed in American press and by individual Americans about increasing Soviet influence in Nigeria, <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will appreciate that USG cannot prevent speculation on this subject among private Americans. USG appreciates FMCʼs reiteration of its position on nature of its relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which His Excellency, head of <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, conveyed to Ambassador at their meeting on December 30.</item>

                        <p rend="flushleft">You asked for a study of the Biafra relief problem by January 28. A member of my staff prepared the attached survey. I have taken the liberty of underlining the most significant parts.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Underlying</hi> is a sketch of the background of the problem with a useful map. I thought it important to trace in some detail the interplay between politics and food. Each of the following Tabs, however, is designed to stand alone for a quick overview.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">At <hi rend="underline">Tab A</hi> is a list of six basic realities of the U. S. involvement in the relief effort.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">At <hi rend="underline">Tab B</hi> are the main options for expanding relief into Biafra. (The data here are drawn from recent <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and Defense studies, but the details of cost and availability might be subject to change in a formal, up-to-the-minute review by all agencies concerned.)</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Recommendation:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">That you authorize me to sign the NSSM at Tab C. This would get the bureaucracy moving toward consideration of alternative Biafra relief programs at an early <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting.</p>

                        <p>There are no exact numbers on the scale of the human tragedy gathering in Biafra. But all our sources do agree that more than a million people are likely to be in danger of starvation over the next 2-3 months. The disaster certainly overshadows direct U.S. interests in Nigeria. There would be no question about evacuating the 5500 U.S. citizens or sacrificing the $300 million private investment on the Federal side if these stood in the way of relief. The heart of our dilemma, however, is that our instinctive moral concern and involvement with this tragedy cannot be separated from the political tangle -- either in the eyes of the two sides, or in the real impact of relief on the course of the war and its broader consequences for Nigeria and Africa. Policy must be measured in terms of (1) its effect on our ability to help get in relief, and (2) long-range damage as well as the immediate disaster.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Background of the Problem</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The civil war is rooted in the failure of the first generation of British-tutored politicians to make something of independence and unity. While London and Washington poured in money and high expectations, corruption grew apace and decisions were drained of content by the tribal bickering that lay behind the facade of national parties. In one sense the first coup in 1966 was a classic effort by young officers to set things right. But they were also eastern <hi rend="underline">Ibos</hi> who murdered with ritual flair a northern <hi rend="underline">Hausa</hi> Prime Minister along with the Premiers of the Northern and Western States.</p>
                        <p>An Ibo general stepped in and tried honestly to hold the union together for a year. But the coup leaders went unpunished and the spiral was rapid. Six months later the general was murdered and 30-40,000 Ibos were savagely slaughtered in the North. Young colonels in a coalition of West and North took over in Lagos. The East (2/3 Ibo, 1/3 minority tribes) took back a flood of terrified Ibo refugees from the rest of the country and talked secession. There followed a predictable sequence of mutual bad faith, mounting chauvinism and outflanking of moderates. The war began in July 1967. It has come down to a stand-off with the rebels -- rechristened Biafra -- holed up in the Ibo heartland, about half the territory they began the war with. The Feds out-number the Biafrans 2:1 in effectives, but French arms and higher morale give the rebels parity for the present.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">The Two Sides</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Federal Military Government</hi> (350, 000 sq. miles, 47 million). General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> -- 36, Sandhurst-trained, devout Baptist -- rules almost literally by unanimity over a tenuous coalition increasingly strained by the standoff. The Western Yorubas, about 1/3 of the coalition, are stirring ominously in tax riots and seditious talk by local politicans. The army seems to remain <pb n="3" xml:id="d25-03" facs="d25-03"/>reasonably solid, if not tightly controlled from Lagos. There is an urge for unity among the elite of all factions, though the strongest cement at this point is probably common tribal hatred of the Ibos. The Feds have cultivated a little elan in discovering they could run the country without the Ibos, who were the backbone of commerce and civil service in the north as well as the south. The Nigerians are proud and latently xenophobic, with a special rancor toward the U.S. that comes of being a guilty offspring who disappointed parental hopes.</p>
                        <p>They conduct the war with often incredible ineptness both in battle and public relations. They tolerate the Red Cross relief operation on both sides but would hardly be averse to winning by starvation. They were outraged by the recent U.S. sale of eight old transports to the Red Cross and other relief agencies. For Gowonʼs regime the logic is simple: food keeps the rebellion alive as well as the rebels.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Current Position:</hi> The Feds still insist that Biafra must renounce sovereignty before theyʼll talk peace in earnest. Within a “federal structure” they have talked about schemes for Ibo protection, including an international police force. But they are vague on questions of political amnesty and the place of Ibos in the future federal army. They see the outside world, and particularly us, drifting toward the rebels out of evil design or misguided sympathy. They feel their own war-weariness, are frightened and emboldened by it, and are probably very near a xenophobic outburst which would find an external scapegoat for their frustrations. Our eight transports almost triggered it. Recent intelligence indicates that the Feds plan a major offensive in March before the spring rains bog everyone down. Barring a real escalation in weaponry or expertise from outside sources, their prospects of breaching the rebel perimeter are still slight. That failure would bring Lagos to the boiling point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Biafra</hi> (3, 000 sq. miles, 4-6 million). Colonel Ojukwu -- 35, British-trained, erstwhile playboy -- presides over the popular support and military morale of a people convinced that defeat means extinction. The Ibos are the wandering Jews of West Africa -- gifted, aggressive, Westernized; at best envied and resented, but mostly despised by the mass of their neighbors in the Federation. They have fought well (by African standards) against heavy odds; their cynical public relations use of the starvation has been brilliant.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Current Position:</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> says in one breath his sovereignty is not negotiable, yet in the next talks about a compromise “confederation” or “commonwealth” which he never defines. He has ruled out the British as <pb n="4" xml:id="d25-04" facs="d25-04"/>mediators and distrusts the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, just as the Feds accept-it, because of its pro-Federal stance. Biafra proffers a “ceasefire” knowing that neither Gowon nor his coalition could survive a hiatus which only gave a respite to the rebel-lion. The rebels seem more aware than before of their desperate food situation, but are convinced they can hold out (or will be bailed out) until the Feds collapse. Short of that, Biafra is almost certainly unable to win the war militarily. If <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> (as he likes to see himself) is Lincoln fighting it out in the Wilderness with draft riots and copperheads back home, <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is Jeff Davis before Gettysburg with time on the side of secession.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Relief and Diplomacy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The immediate food crisis is on the Biafran side, which has been reduced to a 70- by 40-mile enclave in Federal-held territory. The only relief access is to the one working airstrip used for <hi rend="underline">both</hi> arms and relief flights at <hi rend="underline">night only.</hi> The planes come from two small islands off the coast. The religious voluntary agencies (some U.S., some European) fly from Portuguese Sao Tome. But Portugal has been sympathetic to Biafra and occasional arms flights also go in from Sao Tome. The Red Cross had been flying from Fernando Po until stopped last week by their landlord, the government of Equatorial Guinea. That problem is a mixture of high-handedness by the Swiss Red Cross people, perhaps some pressure on the Guineans from the Feds, and mostly the urge of a new and uncertain black regime to show the white men in their midst whoʼs boss. State is hard at work on this. The Red Cross should be able to “rent” a grace period to continue flights until an agreement is negotiated.</p>
                        <p>For the moment, deaths have probably gone down in Biafra as a result of the 300 tons or so of protein concentrates flown in per week before the block on Fernando Po. But the fall harvest in Iboland is being consumed, and they face a carbohydrate famine which will have still greater impact on the population and require much greater bulk than the present relief airlift could possibly handle. The tortuous politics of relief boil down as follows:
<list>
                                <item>-- Both sides have obstructed relief, but the balance of guilt rests with Biafra. In part, there are military priorities over food, but in the last account the rebels know well thereʼs political profit in going hungry.</item>
                                <item>-- Biafra blocks daytime relief flights (which could substantially increase deliveries) because theyʼre afraid Fed MIGs will tailgate and knock out the airfield (which the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s avoid at night or in daylight when anti-aircraft is free to shoot at anything in the air.) The rebels also enjoy the “cover” their arms flights get from relief planes at night, should the Feds grow bolder after dark.</item>
                                <item>-- The Feds endorse daytime flights in principle (to isolate the night arms run and maybe get a daytime crack at the field despite <pb n="5" xml:id="d25-05" facs="d25-05"/>pledges to the contrary). But they regard (with reason) the voluntary agencies flying from Portuguese Sao Tome as pro-Biafran potential gun-runners, and thus illegal. And they donʼt want the Red Cross, which they do accept, flying in the fuel necessary to distribution of food.</item>
                                <item>-- The Feds want the airlift to operate from Federal territory, which would let them inspect the food for hidden arms. Biafra argues a Federal-based airlift means poisoned food (a potent fear in West Africa) and at very least that relief would be hostage to their mortal enemy. The relief people contend a Federal base will (a) hamstring their flights where military operations would take precedence in already overtaxed facilities, (b) cripple what does go out with endless bickering over whatʼs relief (fuel, spare parts, tools) and whatʼs military.</item>
                                <item>-- The Biafrans oppose an overland corridor unless itʼs policed by an army as big as the Fedsʼ to prevent a sneak breakthrough. The Feds talk about a corridor -- again, in principle -- but manage objections to specific proposals and usually demand prior agreement by the rebels.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Over all this are two hard facts about the total relief picture:
<list>

                                <item>Without either (a) a major enlargement of the present airlift (air drops, building another “neutral” airstrip inside Biafra, etc.) which would bring a break between the Feds and the relief operation or (b) a land corridor, we can only scratch the edges of the food crisis soon upon us.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Of the 4 million people, now existing on outside relief and medicine, easily half are dependent on the continuation of the International Red Cross (<hi rend="underline">read</hi> white - foreign) operation in <hi rend="underline">Federal-held</hi> territory.</item>

                            <hi rend="underline">The British</hi> could change things dramatically if they gave the Feds covert help with pilots to interdict the arms flights into Biafra. We have evidence they may have been trying that half-heartedly, but there are no results and time is running out for <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. Otherwise, London tries to look as energetic as possible to quiet backbench critics. The British have no real negotiating leverage in spite of -- or because of -- their arms supply to the Feds.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The French</hi> are behind the arms flights from neighboring Gabon that save the rebels. They think the Feds will break up first and theyʼll have a <pb n="6" xml:id="d25-06" facs="d25-06"/>dynamic new client amid the wreckage of an Anglo-American dream in Africa. Itʼs a cheap investment -- justified so far by events and, one suspects, De Gaulleʼs romantic taste for underdogs.</p>
                        <p>The French have responded to US urging and Red Cross pleas by saying finally theyʼll approach <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> on accepting daytime flights. But there is no sign, and much evidence to the contrary, that theyʼre backing off from their gamble on Biafraʼs survival.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Soviets</hi> jumped in as arms suppliers to the Feds after we declared an embargo on both sides and the British were slowed by Parliamentary conscience. Gowon is at pains to assure us that Moscow is a temporary patron of last resort. So far, in fact, the Soviets have little to show for their <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s and unskilled Egyptian pilots. But they too hold the key to interdiction with a few pilots who can fly the MIGs at night. The most recent <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> estimates are that Moscow is content to wait for the right moment, if ever, to play that trump.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, the Soviets donʼt have a vital interest in Nigeria, and they may shrink from greater involvement as the war drags on and their new clients in Lagos weaken. Despite their aid, theyʼre prey eventually to the general xenophobia awakened in Nigeria by the war. But the Soviet move to become an arms supplier must be seen in several lights: (a) in contrast to their low-profile, de facto retreat from Africa in the last five years; (b) in the wider context of new foothold in the Middle East; (c) as a response to our own discomfort in Nigeria and the “long-reach” mentality in some Soviet quarters; and (d) for its impact on the U.S. public and Congress (so far, slight).</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Africans</hi>. All but four of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> (Ivory Coast, Gabon, Tanzania, Zambia) support the Feds. The latest <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Summit Resolution at Algiers in September reaffirmed the stand. Nigeriaʼs plight is seen as a Pandoraʼs box on a Continent where 2,000 ethnic groups are squeezed into 41 states and secession is a recurrent nightmare for most leaders. The balance of forces is too varied country-to-country for Africa to splinter if Biafra makes it. Yet a rebel victory would probably invite imitation in several vulnerable spots. The odds are heavy it would at least tear apart the rest of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>Real or imagined, fears about the warʼs impact are widespread among Africans. They want the war over as much as we do. But they have no real leverage on either side,. and Emperor Haile Selassie has all but exhausted his prestige in four different rounds of abortive talks. We and the Africans have talked a lot about their solving their own problems; this one is just too hard and came too early before power caught up with good intentions.</p>

Neither national interest nor national security justifies U.S. military intervention. There is no prospect that U.S. military intervention -- with the political disaster it would bring -- would solve the relief problem.</item>

                            <item>To the degree we have leverage, we have it only with the Feds. We need their active cooperation in one half of the relief effort and at least their tacit acceptance in the Biafran half to avoid a military clash. We need their trust for any peace-making role we might assume. The relief effort and our political influence can survive the continuing displeasure mixed with hopeful expectation about our role in Biafra. Neither relief nor influence would survive a break with the Feds.</item>

                            <item>There is at least an even chance an outright Fed military victory would bring some slaughter of the Ibos. The rebel charges of genocide are exaggerated and unproven. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> is an honorable man who knows Nigerian unity would be lost if victory led to mass murder. But he may not be able to bridle his Northern troops fresh from the bush. “One Nigeria” is probably still possible, but we must be prepared to deal with some possibility of atrocities as a result, or scuttle the concept as carrying an unacceptable risk of “complicity” in supporting the Feds even diplomatically.</item>

                            <item>The passage of time as starvation grows and Fed coalition weakens -- only reduces our options. A rapid end to the war is the best way to save most of the people now threatened by starvation. We simply donʼt know how long the Biafrans can live with current prospects, or how long the Fed coalition will hold together. The odds are now that the coalition will outlast the food, but itʼs close.</item>

                        <p>Estimates vary widely because of the very fluid situation in Biafra.

Put together, the relief agencies, UNICEF,<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, etc. see the need as follows:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Biafran relief has become a charged international issue that could severely strain and possibly rupture US-Nigerian relations. There is very little reliable information on the actual number of refugees or on the rate of starvation in Biafra, but it does appear that the situation will worsen within the next few months. The plight of the refugees has not had any significant effect on the policies of either side in the civil war, but the Biafrans use it for propaganda purposes, and at least some Nigerians favor starving the Biafrans into submission as the best war policy.</p>
                        <p>As the war drags on, the federal authorities will probably become increasingly suspicious of foreign involvement in Biafran relief, and may feel compelled to react strongly against foreign countries backing stepped-up relief to the secessionists. Violent anti-US demonstrations could also occur.</p>

                            <item>The area now under Biafran control is approximately one fourth that of the former Eastern Region which Colonel <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> led into secession in May 1967. As a result of the Ibo exodus into Biafran-controlled territory as federal forces advanced, the population in present-day Biafra has increased from a prewar four million to somewhere between six and seven million. Even before the civil war this particular section of the Eastern Region was a densely populated area de-pendent on imported food.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>There is unquestionably starvation in the Biafran-controlled area and in the areas of the former Eastern Region overrun by federal forces. The number of deaths from starvation appears to have risen sharply during the period from last July through October. Deaths probably numbered in the hundreds of thousands, but ac-curate figures are not available. These deaths presumably occurred mostly among the very old, the young, and the sick, After October there was an apparent de-cline in deaths from starvation probably because of an improvement in the food distribution system, the in-creased airlift of food by relief organizations, and the fact that the main yam harvest occurred at this time.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Forecasts on the seriousness of the starvation problem in the coming months range from a relatively low death rate to those predicting mass starvation. The US Embassy in Lagos has estimated that by July some 3.5 million Biafrans and some 2.25 million refugees in federal-held territory will be in need of food. Should the direst predictions regarding the food situation materialize and the worst circumstances prevail, some two to three million people in Biafra and in the federally occupied areas could die of starvation in the next few months. It does not appear that death from starvation will be anywhere near this serious, however. Moreover, a real if unmeasurable consideration in any such estimate is the Biafransʼ ability to cope with the problem themselves. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> recently launched another campaign to increase food production, and it must be assumed that the Biafrans will turn their considerable ingenuity toward alleviating the problem.</item>

                            <item>Relief to the Biafrans has come mainly from Joint Church Aid (<gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>), an association of religious relief agencies operating from the Portuguese island of Sao Tome off the coast of Nigeria, and until early this month from the International Committee of the Red Cross (<gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>) based in neighboring Equatorial Guinea. The unofficial Catholic charity organization, Caritas, has also sent some relief supplies from Sao Tome, and the French Red Cross operates relief flights from Libreville.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> operation was suspended early this month by the government of newly independent Equatorial Guinea for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the unstable situation that prevails in this tiny former Spanish dependency. There is a large Ibo work force on Fernando Po, which the government of Equatorial Guinea fears is bent on subversion. Equatorial Guinea also believes it is under pressure by its much larger neighbor and has come down firmly on the side of Nigeria over the Biafran question. When the territory was under Spanish control, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> operation worked smoothly. After independence last October, however, tension developed between <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> officials and the Equatorial Guineans who have described the relief workers as arrogant and disrespectful of Equatorial Guineaʼs sovereignty. Equatorial Guinean Government officials have also indicated that they are receiving much less financial compensation for the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> operation than the Spanish did. Foreign Minister Ndongo has indicated that his country would consider reopening the airlift if the proper financial compensation were forthcoming. It is by no means certain, however, that he was speaking for his government, particularly the highly volatile President Macias, who has publicly committed himself not to permit <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> night flights and who seems bent on using this issue to underscore Equatorial Guineaʼs independent status.</item>

The Biafrans refuse to open their one operating airstrip to day flights, fearing that the Nigerians would use this opportunity to land troops on the airstrip. Also, the Biafrans want to continue night relief flights as a cover for separate arms <pb n="5" xml:id="d27-05" facs="d27-05"/>flights. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> had been transporting approximately 80 tons of relief supplies per night to the Biafrans, while the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> is presently carrying about 100 tons of relief supplies nightly.</item>

                            <item>Nigeria has reluctantly accepted the need for foreign participation in the Biafran relief effort, but Lagos has always been suspicious of the activities of the foreign relief agencies involved. Lagos would prefer that all relief be channeled through Nigeria, and, ideally, through Nigerian relief organizations. The federal authorities tacitly sanctioned the principle of daylight flights by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> from Equatorial Guinea, but have never given their approval for night flights. Indeed, last November Lagos implied that planes flying into Biafra at night risked being shot down.</item>

                            <item>The Nigerians object strongly to the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> operation from Sao Tome, and with some justification. The <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> has completely bypassed Lagos in its operations, and arms are also being flown to the secessionists from Sao Tome. The same airplanes have been used for arms and relief flights, and it seems probable, although there is no definite evidence, that some of the planes have carried mixed cargoes. The <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> officials are definitely pro-Biafran and have not been too discreet about expressing these sympathies publicly.</item>

The Biafran insistence that relief not be channeled through Lagos results from the secessionistsʼ unwillingness to appear dependent on Nigeria for anything, on a genuine fear that Lagos would poison the food, and on the probably justifiable fear that Nigeria would use relief supply channels, such as a land relief corridor from Nigeria to Biafra, for military purposes. The Biafrans have done all they can to alleviate the refugee and starvation problems, but the secessionist leader-ship has given no indication--even during the July-<pb n="6" xml:id="d27-06" facs="d27-06"/>October period--of being moved by the problem to a more compromising position with respect to the secession issue.</item>

                            <item>As the war drags on, with a probable in-crease in starvation, the Nigerians are likely to be-come even more sensitive to “foreign meddling” over the relief issue. Some Nigerian leaders regard starvation as a legitimate weapon of war and see aid to the Biafrans as merely prolonging the fighting. Most Nigerians, and at least some federal leaders, regard foreign relief to Biafra as direct support to the secessionists in an attempt to Balkanize Nigeria. The strong adverse reaction that greeted the announcement in December that the US was furnishing C-97 aircraft--four to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and four to the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>--provides evidence of the Nigerian attitude on this matter.</item>

                            <item>Federal leader <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> himself probably understands the US position on relief, but he has made clear to the US ambassador that the Nigerian people regard it as aid and comfort to the enemy. US efforts to reopen the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>ʼs operation from Fernando Po have resulted in a definite increase in anti-US sentiment in Nigeria. The Nigerians recently leaked to the press a US note strongly urging--Lagos termed it demanding--the resumption of the airlift. In the Nigerian press and radio, the fact that US Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> held his first official meeting with the Equatorial Guinean foreign minister was portrayed as further evidence of a change in US policy on Nigeria.</item>

                            <item>Official Nigerian reaction to US efforts to increase relief to Biafra has thus far been confined to verbal expressions of displeasure. There has been stinging criticism of the US in the Nigerian press and radio, and some anti-US demonstrations have been held. It would seem likely that as the war continues, further efforts by the US on behalf of Biafran relief will provoke a dramatic increase in anti-US sentiment in Nigeria. This in turn would increase pressure on federal leaders to take strong official action against the US. In the highly charged atmosphere in Nigeria, further <pb n="7" xml:id="d27-07" facs="d27-07"/>US efforts for stepped-up Biafran relief could also easily spark violent anti-US demonstrations that could threaten some of the 5,200 US citizens now resident in Nigeria.</item>

                        <p>There is widespread public concern over the starvation in Biafra. All countries on your itinerary--particularly the Germans and Italians--have contributed to the relief effort through the Red Cross and their own voluntary agencies. <hi rend="underline">The Pope</hi> has tried in vain, including formal letters to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, to get a cease-fire and negotiations.

                        <p>This paper considers relief needs in Nigeria and Biafra and alternative US approaches and programs aimed at expediting and enlarging urgently the flow of relief to Biafra. It sets forth only technical aspects of the actions without discussing political consequences. These consequences are outlined in the second paper, which deals with the range of basic policy choices open to the US. A third paper considers the background of the conflict.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Several Congressional proposals have called for a greater US effort. Some members of the Congress, notably Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>, have pressed for a special Presidential representative to marshal US resources to take the lead in opening up relief routes and an active part in efforts to end the war as the most effective way to bring about relief. The ways an American representative might operate, as well as an alternative proposal for a Citizens Committee, are considered below. An American call for an international relief conference is also discussed.</p>
                        <p>There are three basic considerations in appraising the <pb n="7" xml:id="d30-07" facs="d30-07"/>following alternatives on relief leadership and coordination:</p>
                        <p>(1) A prominent US Government role in coordination -- domestic or international -- makes sense only if we are prepared to undertake a more active (and more politically risky) relief effort than in the past. Otherwise, we may be open to the charge of making a “gesture” without practical significance.</p>
                        <p>(2) Thus, the decision on coordination should be taken in consonance with our general policy approach to the civil war.</p>
                        <p>(3) And finally, the mere appointment of a US coordinator --to the degree this proposal has been made or supported by American public figures with distinct sympathies on the political issues of the war -- will be taken by the warring parties as a political and policy act of the new Administration. The arguments that follow concerning a coordinator are applicable whether he is appointed by the President or by the Secretary of State. There is, of course, the risk of involving Presidential prestige if the coordinator is his personal representative.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The conflicting political and military positions of the two sides are the principal obstacles to expanded relief arrangements, as outlined in Paper II. Moreover, deficiencies in coordination and leadership in the international relief effort have complicated the task of overcoming these obstacles. On the Federal side relief responsibility is vested in the International Committee of the Red Cross (<gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>) working with the Nigerian Red Cross. In Biafra, operations are carried out separately by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and the Church groups.</p>
                        <p>Some have suggested that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> fill the leadership and coordination role. However, the difficulty of separating the humanitarian from the political aspects, the lack of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandate, the reluctance of the Secretary-General, and strong opposition by both sides and most African states to such <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> leadership has made this approach unpromising.</p>

                        <p>PAPER II</p>
                        <p>This paper considers alternative views of US interest in Nigeria and Biafra, the range of policy choices open to the US, and the political consequences of the relief courses described in the first paper.</p>
                        <p>The National Interest. The US has no vital interests in Nigeria or Biafra. Broadly, there are two opposing views of our interests, with many variations. Designed deliberately to heighten the contrast, these are:</p>
                        <p>1. We have a major interest in the future stability of the region and all Africa. We favor the unity of Nigeria to avoid:</p>
                        <p>(a) A blow to the Federation likely to fragment it;<lb/>(b) An environment of continuing hostility that would result in an arms race between the fragments;<lb/>(c) The prospect of great-power rivalries;<lb/>(d) A precedent for secession elsewhere;<lb/>(e) Opposing the majority of African states on a crucial African issue.</p>
                        <p>This view does not imply US responsibility for the future of the Federation—which could include military excesses, political repression, civil strife, and other events beyond our control. Likewise, though we are deeply concerned to save lives and relieve suffering, we should avoid involvement in relief which implies, in Africa or elsewhere, that the US has accepted responsibility, for the peoples affected.</p>
                        <p>We must therefore shield the US from pressures for unwanted direct involvement on ground of little strategic concern--particularly a long-term and largo-scale political, financial, and possibly even military responsibility for the survival of a new political entity in Eastern Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>2. The overriding US concern is to save as many lives as possible. The distended stomachs of starving children, the tragic toll of lives in the tens--perhaps hundreds--of thousands outweigh any other consideration. To the extent that we can, of course, we should keep in mind the important political considerations involved. We should try to organize the relief effort to minimize <pb n="2" xml:id="d31-02" facs="d31-02"/>the problem they pose. These problems must not, however, be permitted to stand in the way of saving human life.</p>
                        <p>Both views of the US interest recognize that the safety of 5,200 US citizens in Nigeria could in some circumstances be at stake, and that the US has an obligation to try to protect the $300 million in investment there. Those holding to the second view usually contend, however, that we should sacrifice our investment if that proves necessary to increase the flow of food to the starving. Some would go further and accept, if necessary, the US Government involvement and very real personal risks to our citizens that would be entailed in evacuating the American community.</p>
                        <p>National Interest and Policy Choices. In examining the full range of policy options to expedite and enlarge relief to Biafra, the first view of national interest suggests that we seek the tacit consent of both sides if possible, and at least consent of the Federal Government. The second view considers the consent of either party important only insofar as it adds to our ability to get food to those who need it. In practice, the policy question on relief comes down to how much we are willing to override the interests of one of the parties and the real implications of the political risks for expanded relief that this would entail on both sides. This question mainly involves our policy toward the Federal Government, since <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> acquiescence is necessary for peaceful access by land or air to relieve the greater human suffering on the Biafran side.</p>
                        <p>The policy options below are examined in this light and keyed to alternative relief courses outlined in the first paper.</p>

                            <item>Relief: Continue present night flights (Course A --10,000 tons), which have a modest potential for expansion without changes in facilities or equipment. This could be increased to 14,000 tons by expanding night flights with more or larger capacity aircraft. (Course B). The latter course, however, would probably lose <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> acquiescence. Strong <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> objections eliminate air drops (Course F) under this option. Surface corridors (Course D) are unlikely because of the conflicting priorities of the two parties.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Review Group Meeting, 3 p.m. today</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers on Biafran relief tell the President:</p>
                        <p>(1) We cannot reasonably expect to expand relief under our present low-involvement policy with Federal Nigeria. The Feds are literally on the verge of breaking with us now. Yet, present relief is by all odds not adequate to the need and will leave us under severe criticism here at home.</p>
                        <p>(2) If we want to expand relief anywhere near the need, we have to become more involved in supporting Federal Nigeria. Or we move toward Biafra to offset the losses we take in breaking with the Feds.</p>
                        <p>The attached talking points for this afternoonʼs Review Group meeting are designed to highlight this basic choice. The IG options paper, as it stands, is useful in arguing the pros and cons of specific policies -- “neutrality”, arms supply, etc. -- which have been loudly and imprecisely urged from the Hill and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>It makes sense, however, to pinpoint the basic choice and focus the discussion by doing a concise summary paper here, somewhat along the lines we followed with the Middle East discussion. We could certainly clear such a summary paper informally with Pedersen, et al. before we send it with the others to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> .</p>
                        <p>Your talking points also ask for some minor but useful additions to the relief systems paper (the first paper):</p>
                        <p>-- They skipped a step by omitting an airlift system, technically feasible, which could meet the maximum estimated need in Biafra.</p>
                        <p>-- The paper should point clearly at the degree of direct U. S. involvement, including military participation, necessary to make these systems work in the real world.</p>
                        <p>-- There should be some discussion, pro and con, of the ideas for a Presidential Relief Coordinator or Citizensʼ Committee, which have such currency on the Hill and in academic circles.</p>
                        <p>In sum, your talking points say (a) we need minor revisions on the relief paper, and (b) we will do a summary paper here which puts the options more precisely in the perspective of the basic policy choices they pose.</p>

                        <p>TALKING POINTS</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The two papers on Nigeria we have before us -- (1) alternative relief approaches and (b) principal policy options as they affect relief --are intended to tell the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> the political implications as well as the methods of feeding people in the civil war. I understand there will be a Background Paper coming shortly.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>We might begin by asking, in a technical vein, if the first paper clearly sets out what the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> should know about the alternative relief systems.
<list>
                                        <label>A.</label>
                                        <item>I wonder about the omission of an airlift system which, by itself, could meet the maximum estimated need of 30, 000 tons per month. If this is technically feasible -- and it would theoretically allow us under one or two of the policy options to meet the need -- it should be included.</item>
                                        <label>B.</label>
                                        <item>It might also be very useful to indicate, under each Relief Course, the degree of U.S. involvement practically necessary to implement that course given the capability or policy of others. This should include involvement of U.S. military personnel and equipment. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> ought to be able to run through these courses and put their fingers on a definite threshold at which our direct participation would be quite visible and might amount to a U.S. takeover of the relief operation.</item>
                                        <label>C.</label>
                                        <item>Given Presidential and Congressional concern, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> may also be interested in a brief discussion, pro and con, of the alternative means of coordination of the U.S. relief efforts. I have in mind specifically the proposals for a Presidential czar or Citizensʼ Committee which have been discussed in Congress and elsewhere. Could these be considered without lengthening the paper too much?</item>

                                </p>
                                <p>Could the IG revise the first paper in this manner and have it back by noon on Saturday?</p>
                            </item>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d32-03" facs="d32-03"/>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>Beyond these technical points in the first paper, I wonder if the second paper makes clear the broader policy questions the options imply. The burden of the paper seems to be that any real expansion of present relief involves -- willy nilly or consciously -- important political choices. I see two basic choices.
<list>
                                        <label>(i)</label>
                                        <item>We can stay with the relief prospects (not very good) of present policy, which amounts to de lure support of Federal Nigeria and de facto support of Biafra through relief (Option 1). Or we can choose more relief, which involves greater support for one side or the other.</item>
                                        <label>(ii)</label>
                                        <item>If we decide to expand relief beyond the prospects of present policy, we can give more support to Nigeria to offset the greater de facto help expanded relief gives Biafra (Options 2 and 3). Or we can shift away from Nigeria toward Biafra. (Options 4, 5, 6)</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>As I read the options paper, it tells the President he cannot reasonably expect to expand relief beyond the potential of present operations without encountering this choice. Do we agree on this understanding?</p>
                            </item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>I do not think it necessary to revise the options paper to get at this conceptual clarity. As it stands, it does treat some specific policies -- “neutrality”, arms supply to Nigeria -- which the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> probably ought to see argued separately pro and con.</p>
                                <p>I would propose, however, to do a concise summary paper here. It would introduce the two papers by listing very briefly the relief prospects and political costs connected with:
<list>
                                        <item>-- continuing present policy as against changing to a more active approach;</item>
                                        <item>-- the choice between changing by a move more strongly on the Federal side or a shift to Biafra.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>I should think that kind of summary would be useful to give a general thrust to discussion of specific options.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The two main papers -- (a) alternative relief programs and (b) policy options as they affect relief -- highlight the political implications of feeding people in the Nigerian civil war. There is also a very worthwhile Back-ground Paper. The discussion proceeds from the basic premise that any real expansion of present relief will involve -- willy nilly or consciously --important foreign policy choices for the U.S. The problem boils down to the following:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We simply do not have good hard numbers on food needs in Biafra. Reports from the Red Cross, other relief agencies and individuals range widely -- from a few thousand hungry to millions facing imminent death. We do know there is a continuing protein shortage. We strongly suspect some general carbohydrate famine over the next few months. No one has done a comprehensive survey. The Red Cross is trying to mount one, though without much progress against their own inertia and political suspicions in the war. In any case, complete study may not prove possible where (a) there is general disruption from the war, and (b) much of the population lives (and dies) unseen in the bush. Even trying a study could take several weeks.</p>
                        <p>The relief operation now feeds about 2 million in Biafra and 1 mil-lion on the Federal side.</p>
                        <p>2. Our most reasonable estimates of Biafran need range from 1. 5 million to 3. 5 million (of 5-7 million total population) between February and June.</p>
                        <p>3. It would require 30, 000 tons per month to meet the maximum estimated need of 3. 5 million at the survival level of calories.</p>
                        <p>4. Technically, the present relief operation can be expanded substantially in 30 - 60 days. The alternatives:</p>
                        <p>Course A, Present night flights = 8-10, 000 tons monthly<lb/>Course B, Expand night flights = 14,000 tons monthly<lb/>Course C, Add daylight flights = 18,000 “ ”<lb/>Course D, Land corridor = 30,000 “ ”<lb/>Course E, River corridor = 30,000 “ ”<lb/>Course F, Add Air drops = 20,000 “ ”</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d33-02" facs="d33-02"/>
                        <p>5. The major obstacles are political. All flights and any corridor would cross Federal territory. Any expansion by more flights or adding air drops requires (a) Federal acceptance if the planes are not to be in danger of attack and (b) Biafran acceptance if flights are to be allowed to land, or air-dropped food is to be distributed. An effective relief corridor requires Federal approval and Biafran acceptance of the food.</p>
                        <p>6. Biafra has so far blocked both daytime flights into their one working airstrip and various proposals for a land corridor, ostensibly for military reasons. The Federals reject air drops as potential gun running and a river corridor as a military disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. Our present policy is to avoid direct involvement in politics or relief, yet get in as much food as possible. We recognize Nigeria and endorse peaceful reunification. Yet we also finance 60% of the relief operation. This means formal, legal (and limited) support for the Federal side as against de facto (and critical) support for Biafra through relief.</p>
                        <p>8. This contradiction has brought us near the breaking point with the Federals. They see increased relief -- without balancing support for them --as taking sides with the rebels.</p>
                        <p>9. The U.S. sale of 8 old transports to the relief operation last fall brought an angry outcry from the Federals. All our experts agree that another expansion, in the context of present policy, will probably provoke a crisis, perhaps involving violence to our 5,200 citizens in Nigeria. Yet present relief prospects are by all odds not adequate to the need, which leaves us under a moral dilemma and mounting domestic pressure.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Basic Choices</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. We face two basic choices in considering expanded relief to Biafra:
<list>
                                <item>FIRST. We can stay with the relief prospects (limited) of present policy -- which is Option 1 of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy paper. Or we can choose more relief, at the price of varying degrees of support for one side or the other.</item>
                                <item>SECOND. If we decide to expand relief beyond present prospects, we can move toward more support to Nigeria to offset and thus allow the greater de facto help that more relief gives Biafra. (Options 2 and 3) Or we can shift away from Nigeria toward Biafra. (Options 4, 5 and 6)</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d33-03" facs="d33-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Options</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Option 1. Enlarge relief with acquiescence of both parties.</p>
                        <p>The central argument for present policy is that this is all we can do without risking greater involvement on treacherous and unpromising ground. The U.S. should not interfere in what the Africans, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> regard as a local problem, and only the two sides can decide to break the impasse in the war or in relief. Meanwhile, we can urge from the sideline, contribute generously to relief, and keep our hands clean with a strict humanitarian concern.</p>
                        <p>The objection is that none of this gets the relief job done. Others have been shown powerless. The parties are so far obdurate. Our support could be decisive for either side. Moreover, as the suffering mounts, we are open to the charge, here at home especially, that we did not do all we could diplomatically short of a military intervention no one recommends.</p>
                        <p>NEXT STEP. The burden of these papers is that the situation now requires more than the present level of U.S. action and involvement. The thinking throughout the Government, however, if that the next step should be carefully measured to minimize the political price we pay in an effort to expand relief. This consensus points toward Option 2.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Moving Toward Federal Nigeria</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Option 2. Enlarging relief by agreement of both sides, or at least the Federals.</p>
                        <p>This requires a U.S. initiative to bargain greater political support for the Federals in return for their agreement to put into actual operation a land corridor or daylight flight plan. We would seek Biafran cooperation, but not shrink from confronting Biafra with a publicized choice to accept or reject food at the point of exchange. This puts our prestige and logistic support behind the most effective relief systems. We would seek African cooperation, but not wait on it.</p>
                        <p>The main virtue of this option is that it constitutes action when all else has failed and prospects are dim. We stand a good chance to parlay our added political support into Federal cooperation on relief. Yet we risk either (a) a Federal turn-down which would leave us still short on relief or (b) a Biafran refusal which might be used against us in skillful propaganda, and the suffering would go on. Failure with this option may point us toward the high risk Option 3.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d33-04" facs="d33-04"/>
                        <p>Option 3. Meet relief needs by all-out support of Federals.</p>
                        <p>Most simply, this option trades military aid to the Federals for relief concessions or air drops which would almost literally force food on Biafra. The risks of this course -- at home and abroad -- are amply stated in the paper. Its great virtue is that it is directed toward the end of the war, the only really effective way to get at the suffering in Biafra.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Moving Toward Biafra</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Option 4. Enlarging relief without Federal acquiescence.</p>
                        <p>This option is designed to show the likely outcome if we move much further with relief under the present low-involvement policy toward Federal Nigeria. In effect, we would be meeting Biafran relief needs at the risk of Federal attack on relief aircraft and at the likely expense of both our direct interests and the present relief operation on the Federal side.</p>
                        <p>Option 5. Enlarge relief without Federal acquiescence and undertake full diplomatic neutrality.</p>
                        <p>The gains and losses of this option are essentially the same as Option 4 on the relief side. Option 5 has the added dimension of “neutral” diplomacy, so often discussed in public and the Congress. The thrust of the argument is that the diplomatic outlook would be problematical, with the nearly certain prospect of a violent break with the Federal side.</p>
                        <p>Option 6. Enlarge relief by recognizing and perhaps arming Biafra.</p>
                        <p>Again, the costs of Options 4 and 5 apply on relief. The advantages, however, are more offsetting in the acquisition and probable survival of a dynamic client. The costs of military involvement parallel those of military aid to the Federals in Option 3. The consensus is that arms aid may force a still deeper embroilment in the problem, whichever side is the recipient.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Keeping Options Open</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The papers do not address explicitly the question of sequence in the adoption of options. Nor do they pose specific options as hard and fast plans which would rule out considerable overlap in action. It is useful to note, however, that some options -- as described -- clearly do rule out others. With Options 4, 5 and 6, to the degree they proceed from a break with the Federals, a basic choice has been made. Likewise, Option 3 with all-out support of the Federals makes a basic choice. Options 1 and Z preserve basic choices -- but only at the price that their failure will pose them eventually, and perhaps under less desirable circumstances.</p>

After meetings with American oil companies in New York February 5, <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> held lengthy discussions in Washington February 6 with Congressmen Diggs, Culver, Brademas, <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> and Fraser and with staffs Senators Brooke and Pearson.

                                <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> stated purpose of his mission was to get sounding of USG policy at beginning new administration. He said in confidence that some in Lagos are “panicked” over what they regard as lack understanding in US for realities Nigerian war and worried about future policies of new administration. Since some <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> officials blame Ambassador lyalla, <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> was asked by <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> to undertake trip to get independent assessment. After few days here, <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> believes he has better feel for depth US humanitarian concern and better understanding <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs problems. Real difficulty lies in Lagos which has ignored many constructive suggestions made by lyalla to improve <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> image in US.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> that it had been suggested to him that <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could improve its position by acting in consonance with Pearson-Brooke resolution. Towards this end, he wondered whether it would not be useful arrange trip to US by <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>, Rehab Commissioner Omo-Bare and Enugu Administrator Asika to confer with USG officials re relief and rehabilitation, publicize what it doing on relief and be available interested Congressmen in next six weeks before resolution voted on. <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> delegation would be prepared talk specifics and <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> mentioned various possibilities even including construction of new airfields in Biafra, emphasizing latter his own idea. He did not state absolutely that <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would cooperate in even-handed relief efforts to extent indicated by Pearson-Brooke resolution but he promised to urge his government to do so. Comment: It evident that <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> deeply impressed by suggestions and comments he had received during Congressional visits.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> replied it certainly be helpful if <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> were independently to address itself constructively in words and deeds to range of problems covered by resolution. However, it should be most careful not to insert itself or appear to insert itself in matter currently under consideration before US Congress. To <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName>ʼs insistent query re usefulness of <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> delegation at this time, <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> said Commissioner always welcome but as we reassessing relief situation ourself a later date might be better. We hoped meanwhile <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would make greater effort understand depth our humanitarian concern and come up with some workable proposals (not generalities) to effectively move relief into Biafra. We realized latter a stumbling block to assistance but somehow food must be moved. As long as children die from hunger it difficult for US public to understand political obstacles. Publicizing what <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> doing on its side no answer since public expects this as matter of course. For present, he suggested we each collect our thoughts and keep possiblity of visit in mind for somewhat later date.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> emphasized deep US concern re <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> bombing of civilians in Biafra and damage they do to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. Amachree agreed with this appraisal both in humanitarian and political terms. He felt sure they were not deliberate but felt margin of error such that in any situation warfare such incidents bound occur. <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> left him in no doubt our strong feelings re necessity corrective measures.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> raised issue of USG concern over Soviet influence in Nigeria. <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> reiterated that communism not controlling concern of USG especially among officials who know independent Nigeria. On other hand, it obvious that “Soviets are after something in Nigeria” and have taken advantage of the war to foster anti-Americanism. Example of increase in Soviet influence was recent improper statements of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador which were not reproved by <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. However, major factor in US policy remains primarily and overwhelmingly humanitarian concern for people. This concern important in open society such as US and western European countries but also becomin apparent in African countries as war drags on.</item>

While we strongly support peaceful settlement in any event, minimal <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> rebuttal to ceasefire demand is successful transportation of relief to needy on both sides of line.</item>

He asked to be kept informed of USG thinking on overall problem and asked also for help in formulating “compromise” proposals on relief. Particularly hoped USG and <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could work more closely together. <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> observed that specific proposals should be offered, not generalities. We presently doing our homework and <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> should do its own, proposing relief action along workable lines and within most flexible boundaries of military security.</item>

In private conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> later, Perm Sec Finance Atta had “brought in politics,” (comment: apparently referring to USG policy on war), On other hand, Min Fin had sent middle level “oil expert” to Hugh Keeley of Mobil who had convinced him that Mobil would lose considerable money under Companies Decree as issued. <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> had reported status of decree negotiations to Mobil in New York and had useful discussion with senior officials. <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> seemed generally optimistic about decree.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AG2">Amachree</persName> showed understanding that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ departure for Florida with President same afternoon prevented call. He had apparently hoped, following meeting with Secretary, to return Lagos with both final word on USG support for <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> plus invitation for <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> et al to visit. In this sense he undoubtedly disappointed since he aware that (a) USG review of policies for new administration still underway and (b) agreement on timing of visit by senior officials deferred for time being.

                        <p>THE WAR:</p>
                        <p>The Nigerian Federation united three major ethnic groups and about 250 smaller ones. From British colonial tutelage, it developed reasonably workable political cohesion and decidedly promising economic prospects through five years of independence. But the corruption and indecisiveness of first generation politicians triggered a coup in 1966 by young army officers, mostly Ibos from Eastern Nigeria. The tribal implications of that coup triggered in turn a sequence of assassinations, tribal atrocities and polarization culminating in Eastern Nigeriaʼs secession as “Biafra” and the outbreak of war 19 months ago. The war is now stalemated with Federal Military Government (<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>) troops surrounding a 7,000 square mile Biafran enclave, or about 1/4 the 30,000 square miles the rebels began with. The enclave contains 5 to 7 million people. Despite Federal military superiority in men and materiel, there is very little prospect that either side, by itself, can win militarily in the next six months unless Biafraʼs arms supply is cut off. THE TWO SIDES are fighting a total war and subordinate humanitarian to political objectives. Moreover, mutual tribal enmities complicate and embitter the political issues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>: General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> leads a fragile, relatively moderate and regionally balanced coalition, determined to preserve national unity and convinced that rebel success would tear apart the country. The military stalemate accentuates inner stresses and strains (tax riots, tribal dissidence, increasing war-weariness), but the common interest nevertheless continues to hold the coalition together. A prolonged stale-mate or ceasefire could well result in the replacement of the present moderate leadership by military leaders who would be proponents of a ruthless, all out military victory and less concerned about international opinion.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d35-02" facs="d35-02"/>
                        <p>In the eyes of the Nigerian public, the international (predominantly white) relief operation helps to keep the rebellion alive through food deliveries and the cover its relief flights provide for arms flights. There is some popular sentiment for expelling it on the Federal side, but the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, conscious of international implications and its own need, has thus far cooperated reasonably well with the relief efforts in its own area. It has also reluctantly acquiesced in the night relief flights into Biafra. Yet mounting frustration and incipient xenophobia threaten to make the relief effort a scapegoat for <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> military failure. There are some on the Federal side who would not be averse to winning by starvation.</p>
                        <p>BIAFRA: <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has the strong support of a people (1) whoseʼ morale appears high, (2) who are determined to win self-determination or independence, and (3) who are convinced--with some past justification--that unconditional military defeat by the Federal forces could mean genocide. The Biafran leaders have successfully----if cynically—exploited the issue of starvation to win political sympathy abroad. They believe time is on their side and that either (a) the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> coalition will collapse or (b) outside sympathy for their plight will bring about a solution favorable to them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">NEGOTIATING POSITIONS:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> insists on one Nigeria and has announced guarantees for the survival of the Ibos and their integration into national life. The present government is unlikely to survive a truce or an unconditional cease--fire which only prolongs rebellion.</p>
                        <p>Biafra insists her sovereignty is not negotiable, dismisses the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> offer of guarantees as not credible, and proposes an unconditional cease-fire that would facilitate relief measures. However, this would also permit military resupply and further strain the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> coalition. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> speaks of a possible “commonwealth” relationship implying a degree of independence unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In short, the positions of the two sides appear irreconcilable.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">THE MINORITY PROBLEM:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The loyalties of Biafran minority tribes appear to be sharply divided. Even before secession, the area claimed by Biafra had long been dominated by the Ibos, comprising about 65 percent of the total population, with non-Ibo tribes, heavily predominant along the eastern border and oil rich southernʼ coast, comprising the other 35 percent. Elements of these minority tribes, even before secession, resented Ibo domination. Many of them opposed secession; others sup-ported it. Some cooperated fully with the Biafran regime after secession. Others fled to Federal held areas and remained firmly loyal to the Federal cause. When Federal troops occupied the minority areas, the population in most cases welcomed them. Others, however, withdrew with Biafran forces into Iboland and have adhered to the rebel regime. Minority tribesmen hold high positions in both the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and the rebel regime.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> charges that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has attempted to hold the minority tribes against their will, and cite as evidence that they welcomed <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> troops and that some minority leaders are imprisoned by the Ibos. It also charges that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is determined to keep these areas because of their oil resources and his need for an outlet to the sea to make a viable Biafran state. In rebuttal, <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has suggested an internationally-sponsored plebiscite in the minority areas to establish their loyalty. Such a plebiscite would presumably require a withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> troops to prewar boundaries, which the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has firmly rejected.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">THE ISSUE OF GENOCIDE:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> overruns Biafra, at least some excesses against the Ibos are inevitable. However, the reports of the inter-national observers have stated that there is no evidence that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is pursuing a policy of genocide. But there are historical reasons (perhaps as many as 30,000 Ibos slaughtered in Northern Nigeria in 1966 before the civil war began) for Ibo fears. Moreover, uncertainties regarding rank and file discipline in the Federal army qualifies <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> official assurances and creates a potential for undisciplined excesses if the war is concluded by military means.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">THE POLITICS OF RELIEF:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About 850,000 people on the Federal side, virtually all who can be reached, are being fed by the international relief effort. As supplies pass entirely through <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>-controlled territory, problems of delivery are of quite a different nature than those applicable to Biafra, where all supplies, arms as well as relief, must pass over or through Federal territory. About two million people in Biafra depend on night-time airlifts operated by the religious voluntary agencies from the Portuguese island of Sao Tome and by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> (Red Cross) from, until very recently, the island of Fernando Po, and now from Cotonou, Dahomey. Deliveries could be increased substantially by either daylight flights or a surface corridor into Biafra.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> opposition to night flights, in which it has acquiesced in the past, is hardening because of arms flights tailgating relief planes into Biafra for protection. It has endorsed the principle of both daylight flights and a land corridor into Biafra with outside supervision to avoid military violation by either party. But it insists that: (a) the relief airlift should be inspected for arms and (b) the land corridor not interfere with military operations. <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> suspicions of all foreign relief agencies are growing. It prefers that all international relief to Biafra be channeled through Nigerian territory.</p>
                        <p>Biafra refuses daytime flights into its one working airstrip for fear <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> aircraft will tailgate to the airfield. Biafra also values the protection given nighttime arms flights by the intermix with relief flights which the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is either reluctant or unable to interdict. It has thus far opposed (or countered with proposals unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>) every land corridor proposed by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> on the grounds that it would be militarily exploited by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and that the food might be poisoned.</p>
                        <p>Both sides have obstructed relief, but on balance, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has indicated more flexibility in its willingness to consider alternate relief routes and possibilities than have the Biafrans. The beleaguered Biafrans give priority to arms shipments over relief and they also know the suffering is a political asset.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> conducts the bulk of the relief operation on the Federal side and a sizeable share in Biafra. Because of its policy of operating on both sides, and since on occasion it has acted with the consent or acquiescence of only one side, it. has become a frequent victim of attack by one side or the other, with no real leverage on either.</p>
                        <p>Religious voluntary agencies ( some U.S.-some European) have little or no leverage on the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> because of the latterʼs belief that their sympathies are with the Biafrans, among whom the percentage of Christians is higher than in the rest of Nigeria. They have been reluctant to press the Biafrans to accept daylight flights or corridors because (a) their airlift from Sao Tome is operating well and they do not want to jeopardize it; and (b) some of the participants, at least, share the view of the Biafran leadership that such arrangements would work to the political or military disadvantage of Biafra.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER POWERS:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The British back the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> with non-sophisticated arms sales. But <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> is under heavy parliamentary and public pressure to stop. They have tried often and in vain to get serious negotiations started. The British will probably continue cautious support of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, but will want to appear active diplomatically to mitigate parliamentary criticism. They have only marginal leverage with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> despite their arms supply--virtually none with the Biafrans.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets became major arms suppliers to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> at the outset of the war when the US embargoed arms to both sides and the British hesitated. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> gives frequent assurances that the Soviet involvement is only a matter of wartime necessity and portends no political realignment of Nigeriaʼs traditional pro-Western stance. We have no evidence that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has thus far granted any significant political concessions in return for Soviet arms. However, Soviet prestige and acceptance has increased.</p>
                        <p>Soviet intentions are unclear. They probably consider Nigeria a target of opportunity to extend their influence at Western expense and relatively little cost to themselves. Whether requested or not, they have not gone beyond <pb n="6" xml:id="d35-06" facs="d35-06"/>the provision of military equipment, including aircraft and the training of pilots. Although disappointed and perhaps somewhat embarrassed--at slow <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> military progress, they appear willing to continue their support in the belief that prolonged fighting and <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> frustrations will increase the political value of their help.</p>
                        <p>The French decision to supply arms clandestinely to Biafra probably saved the rebellion when it appeared near defeat last summer and continues to sustain it. De Gaulleʼs motives are mixed, but he is probably influenced by the possibility of the breaking up of an Anglophone federation which could have exerted a powerful influence in a West Africa in which French interests are so strong. There are also indications that French oil interests are supporting Biafra in the hope of acquiring British and American concessions in the Federally-held but Biafran-claimed minority coastal areas. So far, the French have stopped short of outright recognition. They deny giving arms. We simply do not know how far the French are prepared to go in support of Biafran independence.</p>
                        <p>The Africans see Nigeriaʼs situation as a manifestation of the problem facing most governments on a continent where colonial boundaries enclosed, usually arbitrarily, almost two thousand ethnic groups in 41 states. In the Organization of African Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>), all but four members (Ivory Coast, Gabon, Tanzania, Zambia, which recognized Biafra in 19668) support the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and regard the civil war as an internal question which should be solved within an African (<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>) frame-work. The <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> summit resolution, which passed by a vote of 33-4 in September 1968, appealed to the Biafran leaders to cooperate in restoring peace and unity in Nigeria and called upon all members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to avoid any action “detrimental to the peace, unity and territorial integrity of Nigeria.” It also created an <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Consultative Committee of six African heads of state, which is headed by Emperor Haile Selassie, to assist in bringing about a negotiated settlement. This committee has twice been successful in bringing the two parties together to discuss a political settlement and arrangements for relief corridors into Biafra. The meetings produced no positive results, but there are indications that a further effort will be made by the committee. Meanwhile, the Common Organization of African and Malagasy States (the Francophone nations) has recently decided to make a further African effort which they are trying to keep unpublicized.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d35-07" facs="d35-07"/>
                        <p>Neither together nor separately do the Africans have decisive leverage. The four states recognizing Biafra are important to the morale of the rebellion, and in the case of the Ivory Coast and Gabon, provide a nearby base for arms deliveries. <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> support is important as a morale factor for the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. But precisely because of that support, the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> has little negotiating leverage with the Biafrans. However, Africans generally attach importance to the settlement of the problem in an African context. Moreover, their cooperation and participation with forces are likely to be a vital factor in any peacekeeping operations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: The membership has generally deferred to the views of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> in regarding the war as an internal Nigerian and African problem. <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> has made clear he sees no role for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under present circumstances, other than participation by UNICEF and other specialized agencies in the relief effort. Thus far there has not appeared to be sufficient support among <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members for useful consideration in that forum.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">THE ROLE OF THE U.S.:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Except for our deep concern regarding humanitarian relief, we have regarded the civil war as primarily a Nigerian and African problem. We have: (a) continued to recognize the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>; (b) imposed an arms embargo on both sides; (c) contributed to the international relief effort ($30 million publicly and privately, approximately 60 percent of the total, plus eight Stratofreighter aircraft); and (d) voiced political support for a negotiated settlement in the context of one Nigeria with workable safeguards for Ibo protection. We have looked to (1) the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, the British and the Commonwealth Secretariat to take the lead in peace-making, with active encouragement from us both publicly and privately, and (2) the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> (together with the religious voluntary agencies in Biafra) and the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> to take the lead in the negotiation and operation of relief arrangements, with our active moral, diplomatic and material support.</p>
                        <p>The humanitarian motivation behind our relief efforts is increasingly questioned by the Nigerians, who, in a situation of total war, find it more and more difficult to differentiate between humanitarian relief and political support. They deeply fear that under public pressures we are shifting to an increasingly pro-Biafran position that may have a decisive influence on the outcome of the war. The counterpart of these Nigerian fears are the Biafran hopes that US and other western humanitarian concern will result in political and arms support and eventual victory.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>RESOLUTIONS</p>
                        <p>There is sharp and growing Congressional interest in the Nigeria/Biafra situation. On January 22, with 59 co-sponsors, Senator Pearson (R-Kansas) introduced a well-publicized con-current resolution calling on the President “to increase significantly the amount of surplus food stocks, relief monies, non-combat aircraft, and such other vehicles of transportation as may be necessary for relief purposes.” These supplies are to be made available to and at the request of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, UNICEF, <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, and other suitable agencies operating in the area “with the consent of the responsible authorities.” The USG is also asked to seek the cooperation of other nations. The following day in the House 101 members co-sponsored the introduction of six identical resolutions. The majority of statements in the Senate and the House, all of which supported the introduction of the resolutions, show a primary interest in increasing markedly US relief assistance. Statements in the House were particularly noteworthy in urging against political involvement.</p>
                        <p>A group of Democrats, headed by Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> (D-Mass.), while supporting the resolution, is critical of its narrow focus on relief. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> states that since the conflict already involves Great Powers, the US has the moral duty, as a world leader, to bring about a solution. He is critical of USG deference toward the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and of the lack of our “sense of urgency” about the problem. In contrast, Senator Brooke (R-Mass.), warning against US involvement, argued that the Nigerian situation is an example of the limitations on US power. The US can neither determine a settlement of the war nor impose a cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>On January 31 Senator Dodd (D-Conn.) and 15 colleagues introduced another resolution which not only called for in-creased relief efforts, but stated that the US “should lend its good offices and utilize all of its diplomatic resources for the purpose of bringing about an immediate cease-fire between the Nigerian and Biafran forces and thereafter to promote the conclusion of a just and durable settlement of the Biafran conflict.” The settlement should provide for some form of continuing economic integration.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">Trips to Nigeria/Biafra</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A number of members have made or are planning trips to the war area. In December 1968 Congressman Lukens (R-Ohio) visited Lagos and Biafra. At about the same time Congressman Lowenstein (D-N.Y.) visited both sides and then met with Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> and officials of the British Foreign Office. Lowenstein has now returned for a second time to both sides, his visit coinciding with that of Senator Goodell (R-N.Y.) and a small staff. On February 7 Congressman Diggs (D-Michigan), Chairman-Designate of the Subcommittee on Africa, House Foreign Affairs Committee, accompanied by Congressman Wolff (D-N.Y.) and Burke (R-Fla.) departed to visit both sides.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Biafra Lobby</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The lobby, whose supporters embrace disparate political elements, is a conglomerate of American religious and charitable organizations, ad hoc groups composed largely of students and returned Peace Corps volunteers and Biafran students in the U.S. The motives of the supporters range from humanitarian concern alone to more political involvement extending to official recognition of Biafra. Aided by a highly effective public relations effort and the skillful presentation of the starvation theme, it has been most successful in mobilizing an influential segment of American public opinion and enjoys widespread access to the Congress. The main result of its activities has been to increase greatly the public demand for an increased flow of relief supplies to Biafra and a growing tendency to promote a political stand openly favor-able to the Biafrans and US recognition.</p>
                        <p>Mail to the Congress has been extremely heavy, and the Department of State has answered more than 550 Congressional inquiries on the problem since July 1, 1968. The Nigerian Government has been much less effective in gathering public support in the United States, but nevertheless has sympathizers of its own on Capital Hill.</p>

R said he thinks President should be involved and informed and have opportunity personally to pass on what is done. R said at his request the thing has been carried one step further, which is to analyze alternatives and come up with what we think is a useful recommendation. R said this is just his recommendation to the Secretary - he does not know whether Secretary will go along with it. Basically is is somewhere between option 1 and 2. R said we should go forward with some initiative to deal with release problem - should do so with US rep (Relief Coordinator - named and designated) without political involvement. HAK said he agrees. HAK said if Secretary is prepared to make this recommendation, it would be very appropriate.</p>

                            <item>The Biafran Relief Decision</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The bureaucratic mountain having brought forth Biafran relief in six tidy but costly options, I wanted you to have my own personal views.</p>
                        <p>I see the Presidential interest in this problem as a limited two-fold aim:</p>
                        <p>1. Answer and relieve domestic pressure by demonstrating (a) the Presidentʼs serious concern for the suffering, and (b) that the Administrationʼ is carrying on a fresh and top priority, search for practical solutions.</p>
                        <p>2. A credible try to get in more food without (a) greater political involvement on either side, or (b) risk to American lives, property; and long-range political interests.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Public Stance</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We had a good start on the first aim two weeks ago with the Ziegler announcement of an urgent review. I think it makes sense to follow that now by announcing the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> will consider the subject. After the meeting, we could simply say we were still studying, have steps under consideration, and canʼt discuss specifics. At some point the President might even issue a short statement along the lines of our proposed press conference answer, which he hasnʼt used so far (Tab A). These steps donʼt commit us to anything but concern. They should buy valuable time -- perhaps a month -- to do some quiet diplomacy along whatever course the President chooses.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Policy Choice</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second aim is obviously the tough nut. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> options paper tells the President that the price of expanded relief is almost certainly political movement toward one side or the other, with numerous, risks and uncertain rewards. I strongly agree that he must know this fundamental choice is there At the same time, I see an important nuance in how we approach that choice, and thus how we might explain to a concerned public why we did not make it in favor of more relief cum greater involvement.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d38-02" facs="d38-02"/>
                        <p>As I indicated in the summary paper, there is a general consensus in the Government for Option 2. Youʼll recall that option bargains diplomatic support for the Feds in return for relief concessions designed to confront Biafra with the moral and political opprobrium of refusing to accept food from an operating land corridor. Frankly, Option 2 was posed this way largely because (a) we wished to draw the choices sharply; (b) State and Defense are convinced, at least at the IG level, that the Feds wonʼt come around on relief for less than some hefty U.S. political backing; and (c) there is a unanimous bias in the bureaucracy in favor of the Federal side. (I spent nine hours in unrelieved IG negotiation with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> just to get the minimally fair statement we now have on the merits of Option 6 -- recognizing Biafra.)</p>
                        <p>In fact, there is a threshhold to Option 2 which affords us greater neutrality and less involvement than most of my colleagues are willing to admit. The scenario could run roughly like this:
<list>
                                <item>-- A quiet demarche with the reds to ask for cooperation in setting up a land corridor. Our interest is strictly humanitarian and we withhold political endorsements. Our only bargaining counter is the threat of disclosing non-cooperation.</item>
                                <item>-- A quiet but direct approach to Biafra (perhaps by a newly-appointed U.S. relief coordinator) to ask the same thing at the same time under the same conditions.</item>
                                <item>-- If either side obstructs, for any reason, then make the choice to</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) press the point by greater involvement or (b) brand the obstructor and disengage, continuing present levels of relief with a clear con-science.</p>
                        <p>The major considerations in this approach are:</p>
                        <p>I. We must be prepared at some point along the way for the Feds to hold out for some sort of high-level U.S. lip service to “one Nigeria”. Yet just that would mean taking sides.</p>
                        <p>2. If the approach founders on this Federal price, and the suffering goes on, we cannot make our public case for disengagement here at home without branding the Feds. Yet that would be a blow to their position and State is bound to resist it. <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> et al. will argue, first, that we should kick in “minimum” support, and, if we canʼt do that, we somehow fuzz the question of guilt.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d38-03" facs="d38-03"/>
                        <p>If Biafra obstructs, of course we make our public case and avoid further involvement with the Feds. The problem is that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> will under-stand this as well as anybody. Heʼs too smart to let us off the hook that easily.</p>
                        <p>3. In the last account, however, I recommend this approach on the basis of a simple judgment on the outcome of the war. It allows us to stay reasonably clear of the Feds at a time when the odds are at least even that theyʼre the wrong horse to back. My own (minority) view right now is that Biafra is going to make it one way or another.</p>
                        <p>In any case the post-war future of the Nigerian Federation, with or without Biafra, is likely to be unsavory at best. I see this as just the beginning of a protracted period of turmoil and potential savagery. And the ultimate arbiter will no longer be the English-mannered elite weʼve known since 1960, but rather the bloated and fresh-from-the-bush Federal army, which has put automatic weapons at the service of fractious tribal loyalties.</p>
                        <p>4. Whatever the outcome of the war, the failure of this approach would still let us say we honestly did all we could on relief short of choosing sides in a civil war thatʼs none of our business -- a position which would find vocal allies in Senators Brooke, <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> and others.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Recommendation:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That you support a limited approach of this kind in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> discussion of Biafran relief options.</p>
                        <p>My spies tell me that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and his staff may be thinking along the same lines. But <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> will still be in Paris Friday, and I just donʼt know how Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> will come down after a briefing from the African Bureau. If such an approach were adopted, though, it would seem to be a fit subject for continuing scrutiny on the Under Secretaryʼs Committee -- lest some of those basic choices get made for us in the crevice of a cable to our pro-Fed Ambassador in Lagos.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The great humanitarian traditions of the American people dictate that its government speak out against this senseless tragedy -- and act to prevent the destruction of a whole people by starvation. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> should leave no diplomatic or economic tool unused in his efforts to break the log-jam -- and to help rescue this people from the agony of death by starvation. Americaʼs goal is not to intervene in the civil war in Nigeria -- not to take sides between armies--it is to take sides against starvation.</p>
                        <p>Our history cannot allow us to do otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The terrible tragedy of the people of Biafra has now assumed catastrophic dimensions. Starvation is daily claiming the lives of an estimated 6,000 Ibo tribesmen, most of them children. If adequate food is not delivered to these people in the immediate future, hundreds of thousands of human beings will die of hunger.</p>
                        <p>Until now efforts to relieve the Biafran people have been thwarted by the desire of the Central Government of Nigeria to pursue total and unconditional victory and by the fear of the Ibo people that surrender means whole-sale atrocities and genocide.</p>
                        <p>But genocide is what is taking place right now--and starvation is the grim reaper.</p>
                        <p>This is not the time to stand on ceremony or to “go through channels” or to observe the diplomatic niceties. The destruction of an entire people is an immoral objective, even in the most moral of wars. It can never be justified; it can never be condoned.</p>
                        <p>The time is long past for the wringing of hands about what is going on. While America is not the worldʼs policeman, let us at least act as the worldʼs conscience in this matter of life and death for millions.</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States is a man charged with responsibilities and concerns all over the world. But I urge President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to give to this crisis all the time and attention and imagination and energy he can muster.</p>

                        <p>Every friend of humanity should be asked to step forward to call an end to this slaughter of the innocents in West-Central Africa.</p>
                        <p>America is not without enormous material wealth and power and ability. There is no better cause in which we might invest that power than in sparing the lives of innocent men and women and children who otherwise are doomed.</p>

<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Relief flights to Biafra resumed two days ago from the island of Fernando Po. The Red Cross and Equatorial Guinea have a 30-day, two flights-per-night arrangement, pending negotiation of a longer term agreement. (Youʼll recall these Red Cross flights are 1/2 the current airlift; the other half is the Church Voluntary Agencies flying from the Portuguese-owned island of Sao Tome.)</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The Federals are reportedly ready to consider an idea for a “neutralized” relief airstrip and land corridor put forward by Congressman Lowenstein (D, N. Y.), who visited both sides this week. Biafra has given no response to Lowenstein. The idea is roughly the same as one discussed in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers -- i.e. OBILAGO, an airfield in Federal territory, from which relief is driven 5-10 miles down a road to no manʼs land. Lowenstein gets back this weekend and will debrief Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> tomorrow. This might be an opening for us to follow up.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The war continues to be a stand off, though (a) the Biafrans are getting an increasing supply of arms, and (b) the Federals are trying to mount a major offensive before the spring rains. The Federals think they have to win before Biafra celebrates the second anniversary of independence May 31. But their chances are not good, and the frustrations mount in Lagos.</item>

                                <item>The French told us yesterday in Paris that theyʼre staying with a “wait and see” policy on Biafra. Theyʼll probably continue military help but still withhold recognition. Clearly, De Gaulle thinks he should play out his gamble quietly until something changes substantially in the fortunes of the war.</item>

                        <p>16th January, 1969<lb/>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>I have great pleasure in conveying to you, Mr. President, my sincere congratulations and those of the Government and people of my country on your inauguration as President of the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>Relations between our two countries have traditionally been characterised by a frank and cordial exchange of views at all times. I intend, for my part, to continue this policy during your tenure of office and trust that you will find it possible to reciprocate.</p>
                        <p>I am anxious to establish happy and even informal working relationships with your Administration in order to assure a continuation of the felicitous relations between our Governments and peoples. I know that one of the problems that will engage your attention is the civil war in my country. I fully understand the reasons for the inability of the previous Administration to be more forthcoming in support of my Government and appreciate the genuine desire to alleviate distress in the affected areas. I expect therefore that you will, Mr. President, wish to study all the aspects of the unfortunate war. My Government holds itself ready to cooperate in supplying any further information that may be required. I would, in fact, welcome a personal envoy from you and will grant him full facilities to visit the war-affected areas and stay as long as he likes in order to be able to report to you factually. Such an envoy need not, of course, be a member of the Administration, as long as he is someone who enjoys your full confidence and no publicity would be given unless you so desired.</p>
                        <p>We have noted with great pleasure your determination to work for the unification of your country irrespective of colour, creed or religion, an objective which likewise inspires my Government in its present course of action. We therefore look forward to a greater understanding of our situation and a consequent consolidation of the bonds of friendship which unite our two countries.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that, under your able leadership, parliamentary democracy, civil liberty and human dignity will continue to prosper and flourish in the United States of America and that your great country will retain its time-honoured place in the forefront of the struggle for the universal brotherhood of man.</p>
                        <p>May God grant you the wisdom, strength and health to discharge the onerous responsibilities of your high office.</p>
                        <p>May I also wish you and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> a happy tenancy of the White House.</p>
                        <closer>Yours most sincerely,<lb/>(Sgd.) <signed>

                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> MEETING<lb/>14 February 1969<lb/>Issues for Decision<lb/>Policy Choice</p>
                        <p>Your basic decision is between two principal policy choices in expanding relief.</p>
                        <p>1. More relief by greater involvement in support of one side or the other. Support for Federal Nigeria is the essence of Options 2 and 3. Support for Biafra is Options 4, 5 and 6.</p>
                        <p>2. Make an active and visible effort to get more relief, but without greater political involvement with either side. This involves a course of action somewhere between Option 1 and Option 2. For example: you might appoint a U.S. relief coordinator. We would then seek to negotiate with the two sides a relief arrangement strictly on its humanitarian merits. This policy would improve our public posture, but the odds of success in actually expanding relief are probably less than even. I recommend this course, however, on the grounds that the alternatives of an active policy involve undesirable political involvement with not much better chances for expanding relief.</p>
                        <p>In addition, you might decide the following tactical-operational questions.</p>
                        <p>Reply to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. The Head of the Federal Military Government has written you (copy underlying) inviting a U.S. emissary to exchange views and make a fact-finding tour.</p>
                        <p>1. You could reply by a simple acknowledgement and decline the invitation pending further policy study; or</p>
                        <p>2. you could use the invitation to approach the Federals on negotiating a relief arrangement. I recommend this choice in the spirit of an active relief policy without political involvement.</p>
                        <p>Your conversation with De Gaulle. The French have told us that Biafra will be one of the subjects the General may raise with you in Paris.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d42-02" facs="d42-02"/>
                        <p>1. You might simply hear De Gaulle out but withhold specific comment; or you can tell the French we are actively pursuing relief expansion without political involvement. We want their cooperation in bringing along Biafra. I recommend this approach with De Gaulle. French influence with Biafra might be decisive.</p>
                        <p>U.S. relief coordinator.</p>
                        <p>I recommend you authorize Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to appoint a coordinator working out of State. He should have a broad mandate to oversee our relief effort and negotiate with the two sides on a relief arrangement along the lines of the policy course I recommend above. This should substantially improve our public posture and help emphasize the relief focus of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Public Stance.</p>
                        <p>1. We could withhold any public announcement of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration of relief; or</p>
                        <p>2. the White House could announce that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> had given the matter urgent review in the context of non-political humanitarian concern. We could say we are considering new steps to encourage and expand relief, but cannot be specific. I recommend this public stance.</p>

                        <p>At Tab A, for your approval, is the statement Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> recommend that you authorize today announcing the appointment of a Special Coordinator for Nigeria-Biafra relief.</p>
                        <p>The statement is cast as an initial report on your relief review announced 3 weeks ago. It reiterates the central facts of the relief problem:</p>
                        <p>(1) humanitarian relief is entwined with the politics of the civil war;</p>
                        <p>(2) the U.S. will endeavor to reconcile our deep urge to save lives with our equally deep desire to stay clear of political involvement.</p>
                        <p>The main element of the statement, however, is the appointment of the Relief Coordinator. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> recommend <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clarence Ferguson</persName>, Jr. -- 44, Negro, Republican, former Dean of Howard Law School, now distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers University. (<persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs biographic information is at Tab B).</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> has broached the job with <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, who is clear to accept. He would be appointed, at your direction, by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, and would work under the wing of the Department of State. His mandate would be as strictly humanitarian and non-political as we can make it.</p>
                        <p>State is ready to do the appropriate Congressional consultations prior to release. They will touch base with Senators Brooke, <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>, Pearson, Goodell, <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>; Congressmen Lukens, <persName corresp="#p_AER1">Adair</persName>, Lowenstein, et al.</p>

                            <item>Letter to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, Head of The Federal Government of Nigeria</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A, for your signature, is a reply to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> which conveys your policy approach to the Nigerian civil war. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs inaugural greeting (Tab B) invited you to send a personal emissary on a fact-finding visit to Nigeria. Your reply has been held pending the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study on Nigeria-Biafra relief, and particularly the decision on a relief coordinator.</p>
                        <p>This letter will be a primary policy document in our relations with the Federal side. It should establish clearly both the tone and substance of the careful balance you wish to strike between a high public impact on relief and minimal political involvement. Moreover, all or part of the letter may leak in Lagos. The position it takes should be credible to our own public as well as to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Reflecting your <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision, the letter tells <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>:</p>
                        <p>-- Our interest is principally humanitarian, and we need his cooperation to do all we can for the suffering on both sides.<lb/>-- We are going to appoint a Relief Coordinator to emphasize our strictly humanitarian concern with the civil war. The Coordinator should talk both to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and the Biafrans in an effort to facilitate relief.<lb/>-- The U.S. will avoid political involvement as much as possible. We are not shifting to support of Biafra, and we shall quietly regard a Federal reunification of Nigeria as in our best interests.</p>
                        <p>It is important that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his colleagues have authoritative word from you on these central points -- and in a warm yet frank and business-like manner. We should play it reasonably straight with the Federals if we are to have a chance to accomplish something tangible in relief. And doing something tangible--whatever the magnitude--will be the key to looking credible to public and Congressional critics here at home.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d45-02" facs="d45-02"/>
                        <p>You should decide on this letter before we announce the relief coordinator, and preferably before you leave for Europe. Prior notification to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> of the coordinatorʼs appointment will definitely smooth the way for our relief diplomacy over the corning weeks and months. However, in the tense state of affairs in Nigeria right now, announcement of the coordinator without prior notice will only invite misunderstanding and probably official rancor.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> and I have been over this letter in detail for matters of precision. It is somewhat long and repetitive. We have had to recommend its length, however, as the price of conveying most clearly the atmosphere as well as the substance of your policy toward the Federal side and relief matters in general.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you sign the letter at Tab A.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d45-03" facs="d45-03"/>
                        <p>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I much appreciated your thoughtful letter on the occasion of my inauguration. I share your desire to continue the warm friendship and mutual understanding our two countries have always enjoyed.</p>
                        <p>The civil war dividing Nigeria is indeed of deep concern to me and my countrymen. We feel your tragedy because we are your good friends and because we know so well Nigeriaʼs great potential for peaceful and prosperous development. Since your independence, Americans have worked side by side with Nigerians to help make that high promise come true. I know you understand that it is precisely these close ties that are at the heart of our national anguish over the suffering of innocent civilians on both sides of the civil war.</p>
                        <p>I wish to be quite clear, however, that my Administration has no desire to involve the United States in the political and military issues of this conflict. Those aspects of the war are a Nigerian and African problem. In the last account, only you and your adversaries can resolve them.</p>
                        <p>Yet we both know, General, that the humanitarian concern of the United States -- unalloyed as it is for the great majority of Americans -- is inevitably complicated by political questions. Relief must operate, after all, in the midst of war. The problem you and I face together is how we can effectively cooperate to save innocent lives on both sides of the battle lines, white avoiding any suggestion of United States political interference in Nigeriaʼs internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>I agree that it would be very useful to both of us to establish a channel on relief matters -- by which I may receive first-hand reports of the facts of the problem, and you and your Government may express your views. Thus, we plan very <pb n="4" xml:id="d45-04" facs="d45-04"/>soon to announce the appointment of a Special Consultant, whose mandate would clearly define the strictly the humanitarian nature of our concern over the events in your country. There would be no question of mediation or other political intervention. We shall be in close touch with you, through our respective Ambassadors in Washington and Lagos, on further developments regarding this appointment. I should hope that this representative might have a full and frank discussion with you on how to facilitate the flow of relief to the suffering on both sides. I should hope also for your full understanding of any relief discussions this representative might have with representatives of the secessionist area.</p>
                        <p>I have written this letter -- as I think you would want me to -- in a spirit of candor and openness. And in that spirit I wish to add this final point. I know these first days of my Administration have been period of uncertainty with regard to the position of the United States on the Nigerian civil war. I want you to know that the United States does not contemplate either support for or recognition of the secessionist authorites. We shall hope for the earliest possible end to the fighting and suffering. We shall regard a peaceful end just reconciliation of Nigeria as in the best interests of Africa and all those, like the United States, who wish her well.</p>
                        <p>I hope you will feel free to write me again wherever it seems useful. We lead our peoples at a time when their traditional friendship is sternly tested. If we can work together, however, I am confident we can meet that test.</p>
                        <p rend="right">Sincerely,<lb/>His Excellancy<lb/>Major-General Yakubu Gowon,<lb/>of the Federal Military Government<lb/>of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,<lb/>Lagos</p>

                        <p>The Hon. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clarence C. Ferguson</persName>, Jr., Coordinator Nigeria/Biafra Civilian Relief<lb/>Department of State<lb/>Washington, D.C.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Congratulations on your appointment to a post which bears with it the responsibility for the solution of numerous urgent and complex problems. We trust that whatever is done will be done in light of the fact that thousands of our fellow human beings are needlessly dying every day as a result of an impasse which only the major powers can solve.</p>
                        <p>We are earnestly hoping that one of your first acts will be to request the Nigerian Government to cease its inhuman harassment of relief planes through the nightly bombings of Uli airstrip which, according to our pilots, are aimed primarily at disrupting the movement of foods and medicines in to the hapless civilians of the blockaded secessionist area of Biafra.</p>
                        <p>We are aware of the fact that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> considers the Uli airstrip a military target. However, its nightly bombings have had little or no effect on the delivery of munitions. Instead, our pilots tell us (Senator Goodell can add to this personally) that the bombs carried by the Nigerian “Intruder” are deliberately directed toward the destruction of the relief aircraft. Within the past fortnight five of the church planes have been damaged by anti-personnel bombs dropped by the Nigerian bomber while they were being unloaded at Uli. Moreover, as I am sure you know or will be informed, the harassment is particularly directed toward the American crews and has been the principal reason for the resignation of three American pilots who considered the risks too great in terms of their family responsibilities at home.</p>
                        <p>We believe, too, that your request to the Nigerian Government should be backed by the pledge that if the bombing is not halted, the United States will provide armed escorts for the defenseless relief planes.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult for the average American to understand why his government cannot exercise its considerable political and moral authority to bring this senseless situation to a halt.</p>
                        <p>The staff of the Agency for International Development both in Washington and in Lagos, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, which has been directly involved in assisting the <pb n="2" xml:id="d47-02" facs="d47-02"/>victims of the Nigerian civil war on both sides of the front, and the staff of UNICEF, which has been doing as much as it can within its limited mandate, have already researched the areas of what foods and other supplies will be needed and presumably when. The problem requiring action now is how to keep the existing lifeline open so that tens of thousands of additional civilians in the blockaded area do not die. It is to this particular task we trust you will give your earliest attention. Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Edward E. Swanstrom</persName>, President of Joint Church Aid-U.S.A., and Mr. James MacCracken and Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, Vice-Presidents, on February 12th dispatched an urgent message to the President of the United States and to the Secretary of State calling this situation to their attention, and followed same with a second wire the next day stemming from the reports of damage suffered by the church planes.</p>
                        <p>As the facts indicate, your help is sorely needed. We trust you will do your best to provide it now.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> opened the meeting by suggesting that it be conducted as though all the time necessary were available. He asked what subjects the Secretary wished to discuss first.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> thought it would be helpful to begin discussing Biafra. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> agreed to that but asked for an opportunity to discuss economic and monetary problems for one-quarter of an hour at some point during the day.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> then set forth the French position on Biafra. The French view Biafra as an especially important problem for several reasons. First, owing to the moral aspect of the question. For many months now there has been much tragedy in Biafra. The U.S. Government was as aware of this as the French. All information available to the French indicates that the tragedy is growing day by day. The French have established health facilities outside of Biafra and information received in recent weeks demonstrates that the distress of the refugees is growing <pb n="2" xml:id="d48-02" facs="d48-02"/>daily and that the children are suffering more and more from famine. This, despite the efforts made with more or less success by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, the French Red Cross and European and American charitable organizations. Therefore, the situation is morally unbearable.</p>
                        <p>As for the political aspect of the problem, he had two comments to make. The first regarding the internal situation in Africa and the second regarding the way the problem affected the relations between the great powers.</p>
                        <p>The French believe that the argument that Biafra has seceded from Nigeria is not very valid. In 1959 and 1960 when Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> was Prime Minister, the French had been faced with another problem of how to grant independence to their former colonies. They had the choice of giving the African nations around Dakar -- former French West Africa -- their independence as a group, and the territories around Brazzaville --former French Equatorial Africa -- their independence as a group, or allow the people of Africa to pursue their own destiny. The French decided to grant independence state by state because they thought that giving independence to a federation was a mistake and would lead to serious conflict and bloodshed. At one instance Senegal and the Sudan sought to create a state but that lasted only a year. The French believe that the United Kingdom made a mistake in giving the territories around Lagos their independence as a federation. It was obvious that the situation couldnʼt last. It is wrong to think that granting independence to a multi-racial group in Africa can lead to a lasting arrangement.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d48-03" facs="d48-03"/>
                        <p>Therefore, the French believe that the view that the Ibos, who are the leading ethnic group in Biafra, are seceding is a rather abstract one because the error was obvious from the start.</p>
                        <p>Looking at the problem from the external standpoint, Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> stated that for two years now we have witnessed the presence of the Soviet Union in the heart of Africa. The U.S. is as aware as the French are of Soviet policy, attempts and failures in Africa. At the present time through its arms shipments to Nigeria and its support of the Arab countries that are helping the Moslem elements vs. the non Moslem elements -- namely the Christians -- they are creating a politically dangerous situation. The French fail to see how the Western nations cannot recognize its importance.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> continued by stating that African leaders, both French-speaking and English-speaking, such as Houphouet-Boigny, Nyrere, and Kaunda have stated that they do not see how the Western nations, among them the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, fail to realize the extent of the danger entailed in increased Soviet influence in Africa. They may be exaggerated but none the less this is a danger which the French feel is very present.</p>
                        <p>The next point Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> made was that the Ibos, who constituted the majority in Biafra, do number 9 or 10 million. Of course, in view of the hundred of thousands of deaths in the last year or so, it is hard to know precisely how many there are. None the less, the French do not agree with the concept that the establishment of Biafra as a new state would tantamount to merely setting up another very small <pb n="4" xml:id="d48-04" facs="d48-04"/>state in Africa, because most African countries do not have that large a population. If the situation as it has existed for the last 18 months is allowed to drift, we will have those millions of people in revolt and we will have a festering wound in Africa. Therefore, the French believe it is necessary to take steps to stop arms shipments and then with the help of African leaders -- who are only too willing to help -- to get talks going based on the right of self determination of the Ibos. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> did not know what course U.S. diplomacy would take but that in essence was the French line.</p>
                        <p>He realized that this may seem a relatively small problem to that of the Middle East but it was necessary to take account of the infiltration in Africa by the Russians, the Arabs and possibly the Chinese. It is for that reason that the French think it is important to act.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> added that the French do not agree with the argument that the United Nations General Assembly is not competent to deal with the question owing to the existence of the Organization of African Unity. He had already rejected that thesis speaking before the United Nations. If one were to argue that because of the existence of continental bodies the United Nations was not competent, then soon the U.N. would have jurisdiction only over the oceans and the seas.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> then stated that in the firm position taken by General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">deGaulle</persName> and the government the French were not pursuing any material interests. Were that the case, the French would have to support the Lagos government. In a fortnight, Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> would be seeing the Foreign Minister from Lagos and would talk to him exactly as he had talked to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d48-05" facs="d48-05"/>
                        <p>He again stated the urgent need for action. Although the question was not as important as that of the Middle East, he believed there was a danger for world security. It is dangerous to allow revolutionary and subversive trends to develop which would lead to sustained anarchy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> thanked Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> for his presentation, adding that in this area the U.S. respects the French advice and views because our experience as a nation there is rather limited. We realize the gravity of the situation in Nigeria. Also there has been much concern about it expressed by the American people. Several Americans who have gone to Federal Nigeria and Biafra recently have reported that conditions were very much as Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> had described them. There is the danger of further starvation, more deaths and famine. There is the risk of further deterioration in the next 3 or 4 months. Therefore, as a government and a people we are deeply concerned about the humanitarian question.</p>
                        <p>United States policy is toe support states as they now exist in Africa. Our reasoning is that they are members of the United Nations and we say and we mean it when we say it, that we respect their sovereignty. Also many boundaries in Africa are illogical. They are not based on geography or population and are purely fortuitous. If attempts are made to change them, they could lead to revolts and rebellion. Hence our policy is not to encourage changes but to support existing governments.</p>
                        <p>We recognize the validity of the point that Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> had made so as a government we are not involved either openly or covertly in the political aspect of the problem. We are doing much on the humanitarian <pb n="6" xml:id="d48-06" facs="d48-06"/>side. We have provided some $25,000,000 worth of food and other such supplies, we have furnished planes to transport the food and we have recently appointed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> of Howard University to serve as relief coordinator. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has authorized the government to make a maximum effort on the humanitarian side. We stand ready to provide larger amounts of food and medicine and more transportation to help. The problem is how to get the food to Biafra. We have talked over the situation with representatives of some of the neighboring states. We find it hard to understand why Biafra is not willing to agree to daylight flights. We do not see what the military problem is; we could give them all the protection they need regarding daylight flights. Our position is that we will do all we can to provide food and like supplies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> continued by stating that we recognize the threat entailed in the Soviets supplying military equipment to the Federal government. He referred to Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>ʼs statement of surprise that the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> do not appear to recognize the seriousness of the problem, and made it clear that indeed we do. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> states that it cannot stop sending military equipment to the Federal government because if they donʼt supply it, the Soviets will and thus gain greater influence. The U.S. does not intend to become involved either by sending military equipment to anyone or by taking sides on the political issue. We would support any initiative that the French or other countries might make towards United Nation involvement. We are as aware as the French that the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> does not think it appropriate for the U.N. to become involved, and they themselves refuse to. We would hope that the U.N. could be <pb n="7" xml:id="d48-07" facs="d48-07"/>effective but we donʼt quite see how this could be achieved.</p>

We would support that if all of those involved were to stop. We are not supplying arms and we do not intend to. He then asked what else the U.S. could do that could be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> stated that the French believe that anything done on the humanitarian side would be inadequate compared to the immensity of the tragedy. Efforts are being made to collect money, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and other groups are trying to do so too but it will never be enough. Also the problem is political because in the Ministerʼs view the Ibos will never consent to becoming Nigerian citizens again. If they will never agree to that, the military tragedy will continue.</p>
                        <p>He then commented that he had discussed the question with the Soviet government. Their policy in Africa is to support the Arabs and the Moslems, thus this takes on the aspect of a religious war in Africa. If no action is taken in the name of self determination and if no action is taken to allow the Ibos to set up a state, then the war will go on.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> then stated his view that the reason why the MU will never favor peace is because of the number of Moslem states in the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> fully understood the legal and procedural issues involved but reiterated that the war will go on if appropriate steps are not taken. If the war goes on then this will lead to an increased presence of subversive movements which all the neighboring states believe will gradually result in serious consequences.</p>

                        <p>Based on the present situation the French are convinced that if the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> could put pressure on the Federal government to agree to peace talks on Biafra based on the right of self determination of the Ibos -- it being understood that there could be confederal links between areas -- then there could be peace. But Lagos must not be allowed to think that it can continue with its present line and have the support of the great powers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> remarked that the concept of self determination takes many forms. If we were to speak of it as meaning that any group in a sovereign state can secede, then it takes on an entirely different meaning. In the U.N. the African states mean self determination between people in a given state. Otherwise, it is an invitation to any group to secede. We recognize that there may be moral arguments to the contrary but generally the phrase does not but rather the right of the people within a state to determine their own future. Therefore, in relation to the suggestion that the U.S. government support the right of self determination we do support that right but generally within existing states. Moreover, when talks are suggested it is always accompanied by the idea that a conclusion has already been reached, i.e., that Biafra will decide whether it will be sovereign or not. He thought it better to suggest talks without suggesting a conclusion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> added that he was not certain that the Biafran leaders want to talk without conditions. He asked whether Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> thought they were ready to talk without setting terms or conclusions. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> said that the French thought that it is Lagos that will not consent <pb n="9" xml:id="d48-09" facs="d48-09"/>to talks unless Biafra agrees to forego secession. The problem in achieving peace is whether the Lagos government will agree to talks regardless of the outcome. That is, even if Biafra goes independent.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> again asked whether the French thought Biafra would agree to talk unconditionally. Minister Debre replied that that would be easy to find out. The French have the feeling and it is only a feeling that Biafra would agree to peace talks without preconditions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> thought this was a point worth pursuing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> then remarked that he was very interested in Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>ʼs reasoning regarding the Soviet Unionʼs support of the Federal government. He agreed with Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>ʼs premise that their presence is a serious impediment to progress. He was interested in Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>ʼs rationale about why support to Biafra offset that. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> says that if it does not continue its support of the Federal government, then the Sovietsʼ efforts will be even more successful.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> said the only reply to that argument was that if there were peace talks, their evaluation could change the course of events. At present, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> is a prisoner of the fact that it thinks the cause of the Lagos government be defended. This opens the way to an increased Soviet presence, which only an effort at stopping arms deliveries could forestall.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> explained that his point was that based on the logic of the situation, if the Soviet Union were making inroads by supplying military equipment, then the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> could say that it would supply more equipment, enough to end the war and get the credit for it.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d48-10" facs="d48-10"/>
                        <p>That is the logical conclusion of this line of reasoning without going into the moral merits of it.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> replied that he was certain that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ colleagues who visited Africa (and he hoped they would do so soon) would find that the presidents of the Ivory Coast, Zambia and Tanzania will all say that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>ʼs present policy is placing the Soviet Union in the heart of Africa. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> asked what the conclusion of that reasoning was. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>ʼs comment was that President Houphouet-Boigny exaggerates but in conversations with the French, he continually warns them that Soviet aid to Lagos could have serious political consequences which in his view should not be underestimated. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> did not think that President Houphouet-Boigny was wrong. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> stated that we agree on that point but there is a question of logic involved. It could be suggested that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> should send the Federal government all the arms it needs in which case they would not need Soviet equipment. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> commented that a nation at war gets its weapons wherever it can. There is no answer to the problem other than peace.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> replied that we agreed on that. Be added that we would talk further with the French about the forms of humanitarian assistance we could give. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> replied that in his view humanitarian assistance will not solve the problem because it is a political one and that is how it should be viewed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> wished to conclude the discussion on Biafra by asking what, apart from what we are already doing, the U.S. should do.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d48-11" facs="d48-11"/>
                        <p>He thought we should try to urge the Federal government to talk unconditionally. We should increase the humanitarian effort even though we recognize that it is inadequate. Also we should welcome any initiatives that might be taken by the French, U.S. and other governments that hold out the promise of progress. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> replied that a statement by the Lagos government that it is ready to talk peace without preconditions would be a decisive step. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> asked: “even while the war goes on accompanied by a cease-fire?”. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> replied that if this formula were accepted, a cease-fire would accompany the start of the talks. In any event the French are convinced that if preconditions are not imposed, there can be peace talks. To this Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> replied that a cease-fire is a precondition and it was more conceivable that there would not be a cease-fire. It is possible that the Federal government rightly or wrongly thinks it may win the war and may make a major effort in that direction in the next month or so. We believe that everyone concerned should be urged to talk without setting any preconditions including a cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> then made reference to Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>ʼs comment that it would be helpful if there were a secession of arms deliveries. We would support that if all of those involved were to stop. We are not supplying arms and we do not intend to. He then asked what else the U.S. could do that could be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> stated that the French believe that anything done on the humanitarian side would be inadequate compared to the immensity of the tragedy. Efforts are being made to collect money, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and other groups are trying to do so too but it will never be enough. Also the problem is political because in the Ministerʼs view the Ibos will never consent to becoming Nigerian citizens again. If they will never agree to that, the military tragedy will continue.</p>
                        <p>He then commented that he had discussed the question with the Soviet government. Their policy in Africa is to support the Arabs and the Moslems, thus this takes on the aspect of a religious war in Africa. If no action is taken in the name of self determination and if no action is taken to allow the Ibos to set up a state, then the war will go on.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> then stated his view that the reason why the MU will never favor peace is because of the number of Moslem states in the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Moscowʼs views of its interests in Nigeria in general, and of its relations with Lagos in particular, are important factors in assessing the possibility that the Soviets might be interested in a compromise solution to the Nigerian civil war. This paper analyzes current Soviet-Nigerian relations and concludes that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may be inclined to look more favorably on such a solution than it has before now.</p>
                        <p>ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>Even while strong Soviet military and political support for Federal Nigeria in the civil war continues, relations between Moscow and Lagos are becoming increasingly characterized by disagreements, disappointments, and frictions. Recent points of tension include: disgust by high Nigerian Government officials at the Soviet handling of a naval visit to Lagos, refusal by Nigerian leader <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to let a Soviet technical team inspect a defense facility, Moscowʼs rejection of Nigerian pleas for more sophisticated military support, and growing Soviet disappointment with the course of the war.</p>
                        <p>The civil war, and Moscowʼs exploitation of it, have made possible a considerable increase in Soviet presence and visibility <pb n="2" xml:id="d53-02" facs="d53-02"/>in Nigeria. But the war may now be nearing the end of its utility for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a vehicle for improving its position there. Moscowʼs dilemma is that its bid for greater influence in Nigeria may come increasingly into conflict with other international considerations, e.g., its relations with Paris (Biafraʼs chief supporter), its image in the face of humanitarian sympathy for Biafraʼs plight, and signs of growing African sentiment for a compromise peace settlement. Yet if the Soviets decreased their military commitment to the Nigerian Government -- or, given Nigerian exasperation with the war, even if they kept it at its current level -- they could imperil what they have already gained in Lagos.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets may well be reappraising their Nigerian policy with an eye to seeking or supporting a compromise solution which could bring the war to an end. There are two cases in which they would probably not be interested in such a solution: (1) if they felt that their support for a settlement would cause the Federal Government to think that they had sold it out, and (2) if the British position in Nigeria eroded to the point where Moscow believed it could replace London as Lagosʼs chief patron. On the other hand, if British influence remained strong and if the Soviets thought they could play the role of a Tashkent-style mediator without sacrificing their significant presence in Nigeria, they could possibly be tempted to support a negotiated settlement.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">Bilateral Problems Proliferate</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nigerian distrust of Soviet motives, which still pervades important elements in the government (including its chief, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, as well as some other military leaders), has manifested itself in several ways recently. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> reportedly was incensed at the behavior of Soviet Ambassador Romanov during the Soviet naval visit to Lagos March 5-9. In an attempt to regain custody of a Soviet seaman who had jumped ship in Lagos harbor, Romanov apparently told the Nigerian police that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> himself had ordered the immediate release of the would-be defector. At a staff meeting March 10 <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> denounced Romanov as a liar. The naval visit also occasioned a personal dispute between Romanov and Admiral Joseph Wey, the Nigerian navy commander, who had succeeded in postponing the visit several times and then in limiting it to fewer days than the Soviets wanted. Wey also publicly called Romanov a dishonest man and accused him of saying malicious things about him.</p>
                        <p>Despite the great importance of Soviet military aid, the Nigerians have tried jealously to protect themselves from Soviet snooping. Lagos has consistently attempted to limit the size of the Soviet Embassy there and to control Soviet front organizations. In January <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> refused to allow a Soviet technical team to inspect a defense facility in Kaduna, even though the team had been invited to do so by the Nigerian Defense Ministry.</p>
                        <p>For their part, the Soviets have not increased their level of military support for Federal Nigeria, although they have continued to furnish additional quantities of the types of equipment already provided. (Moscow has supplied an estimated $13 million worth of arms to Nigeria since mid-1967.) In February Moscow rejected a Nigerian request for Soviet pilots to fly night missions over Biafran territory (Egyptian pilots now used have proved inefficient on such missions and are reluctant to continue them). Moscow has failed to supply Lagos with weapons (e.g., radar-controlled anti-aircraft guns or surface-to-air missiles) which could interdict arms flights to Biafra. Moreover, intelligence reports have indicated that the Soviets are disappointed with the Federal Governmentʼs failure to win the war quickly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Civil War: Past Plus, Future Minus for the Soviets?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From a relatively small base two years ago, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has in-creased its presence and visibility in Nigeria considerably. <pb n="4" xml:id="d53-04" facs="d53-04"/>In addition to their influence over the Nigerian left, which is exercised chiefly through the Socialist Workersʼ and Farmersʼ Party (a crypto-communist party founded in 1963), the Nigerian Trade Union Congress, and the Nigerian-Soviet Friendship Society (the largest of its kind in Africa), the Soviets are now being treated with increased friendliness by senior civil servants and civilian politicians. Despite the problems connected with the naval visit, it was the Soviet navyʼs first to Nigeria, and as such symbolizes the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>ʼs growing prestige there. As a result of its military aid, Moscow also has succeeded in stationing a Military Attache in Lagos. While by no means the dominant foreign power in Nigeria, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has made remarkable progress in a basically Western-oriented country.</p>
                        <p>It is the civil war, which Moscow exploited by responding promptly to the Federal Governmentʼs need for arms, that has made these Soviet inroads possible. However, the war may be nearing the end of its utility for the Soviets as a vehicle for improving their position in Nigeria. By limiting the quality of the military equipment it is supplying to Lagos, Moscow has laid itself open to possible Nigerian charges that it is interested only in prolonging the war to protect the growth of Soviet influence in Nigeria. Persistent Soviet refusals to meet Nigerian pleas for a higher level of military aid would be likely to produce still more bilateral tensions, which could culminate in a full-scale Nigerian effort to limit and even diminish the Soviet diplomatic, cultural, and economic presence. If the Soviets retaliated by reducing military and/or economic aid, they could jeopardize further the influence they have worked so hard to create.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if Moscow were to escalate the level of military aid with the aim of producing a quick and decisive Federal victory, it could run the risk of aggravating France, Biafraʼs chief supporter, and possibly of provoking an increase in French aid. This in turn could result in continued military stalemate and thus confront Moscow with the same questions all over again. French support for Biafra is thus a partial deterrent to an increased level of Soviet military assistance to Federal Nigeria. Moreover, unhappy Soviet experience with heavy commitments to the UAR and -- in the sub-Sahara Africa -- to Ghana and Mali indicates that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be unlikely to expand dramatically its military investment in Nigeria.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d53-05" facs="d53-05"/>
                        <p>Moscowʼs dilemma is that its goals in Nigeria may come increasingly into conflict with international considerations (its relations with Paris, its image in the face of humanitarian sympathy for Biafraʼs plight, signs of growing African sentiment for a compromise peace settlement). To ease their position, Soviet policy-makers may look with more sympathy than they have before on a compromise settlement which could allow Moscow to retain most of its gains in Federal Nigeria, while recouping its prestige in eastern Nigeria. Indeed, Biafra is an area to which the Soviets devoted most of their attention before the war began, and there is evidence that they have been in intermittent contact with Biafran representatives since the outbreak of hostilities. Soviet press and propaganda organs have consistently referred to the Biafrans and their leader, Col. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, as misguided but not malevolent.</p>
                        <p>There is other fragmentary evidence that Moscow has not locked itself too tightly into support of the Federal side. A March 17 article in the London Financial Times quoted “reliable sources” to the effect that high-ranking Biafran officials had been approached by Soviet representatives who suggested that Moscow could use its influence in Lagos to win a political settlement acceptable to the Biafran leadership. It is possible that the Financial Times story is no more than a Biafran attempt to drive a wedge between Moscow and Lagos, but it may contain a germ of truth.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Whither the Soviets?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Under what conditions would Moscow be disposed to seek, or agree to, a negotiated compromise settlement of the war? The Soviets would not favor such a settlement if they thought that it would undermine their goal of preserving and increasing their influence in Nigeria. If Soviet support for a settlement caused the Federal Government to feel that the Kremlin had sold it out, the Soviets would probably not be interested. If, on the other hand, Moscow thought it could play the role of a Tashkent-style mediator, winning bouquets from both the Nigerian and Biafran side (as well as from Africa and the neutralists in general), it could be very tempted.</p>
                        <p>In the coming weeks, the Soviets can be expected to be very sensitive to two major considerations. The first is British influence in Nigeria. If the growing unofficial sympathy in Britain for Biafra were to damage the British position in Lagos, or if the British Government were to take any unilateral action which <pb n="6" xml:id="d53-06" facs="d53-06"/>could be construed in Nigeria as abandonment of the Federal side, the Soviets would probably be inclined to reiterate their sup-port for Lagos, on the assumption that they would stand to gain what the British lost. Thus, Moscowʼs support for a negotiated settlement probably depends on the continuation of British influence in Federal Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>The second major Soviet consideration is whether, in a war which the Nigerians seem unable to win at the present level of Soviet (as well as British and other outside) aid, the Soviets can maintain the influence they have gained and still refuse an enhanced level of military support. Their policy of limited military assistance has paid off so far. But will it continue to pay off as tensions between the governments in Moscow and Lagos increase? Or will Soviet exasperation at Nigerian military and economic inefficiency and Nigerian exasperation at Soviet failure to provide advanced weapons combine, as the war drags on, to erode the influence which Moscow has gained in Nigeria? The current situation in Nigeria suggests that Soviet policy there is entering a period of greater flexibility, during which Moscow may be increasingly willing to seek a way out of its growing dilemma by means of a compromise settlement of the war.</p>

They have been stymied by their own inefficiency and dogged Biafran resistance fueled by the French arms supply. But the political pressures and frustration have been building steadily inside the Federal coalition. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his colleagues are clearly afraid (and justifiably so) that if Biafra survives to celebrate its second anniversary of independence on May 31st, it will be a major diplomatic and moral victory for the rebels.</p>
                        <p>Operating on that timetable, the Federal First Division apparently launched a major attack last week from the north side of the Biafran perimeter (our latest intelligence map is attached). They seem to be striking directly for Biafraʼs capital of Umuahia, though a secondary target would be the airstrip 20 miles to the west of the capital where Biafran arms and food come in by night airlift. There are few hard facts so far on the progress of the offensive. First reports had the Federals moving against. very heavy resistance to within 12 miles of the Biafran capital. Federal 105 Howitzers could have been within range of the capital over the weekend. Destruction or capture of Umuahia would be a major Federal victory and a serious blow to Biafran morale.</p>
                        <p>Today, though, there are Biafran claims that the Federals are being pushed back. Judging from the slim evidence we have, our intelligence people now think the Federal offensive has been stalled.</p>
                        <p>There are just too many imponderables here to predict the outcome For example: (1) Federals have taken much of this ground before only to <pb n="2" xml:id="d54-02" facs="d54-02"/>be repelled or outflanked by the Biafrans; (2) Biafra is still getting enough arms, by air - ab out 100 tons a week -- to support a credible defense against the larger Federal force; (3) the other two Federal divisions on the line -- in the west and south -- have not been able to move, yet their breakthrough is probably essential to make possible a sustained advance by the attacking division in the north; (4) finally, even if the Biafran capital should fall, the rebels would have their forces largely intact and could regroup to a new defense line.</p>
                        <p>On paper, in sheer numbers and materiel, the Federal offensive ought to be successful. As throughout this bitter little war, however, the issues will probably be decided by factors of Biafran morale and ingenuity that no military manual could measure. In sum, this latest Federal offensive might alter the fighting line, but the odds are still against a quick end to the war and suffering.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>ʼs Visit to Nigeria</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Predictably, <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> has returned empty-handed from his flying visit to the Federal side last week. He was given a polite but cool reception by the Nigerians, who understood the trip was mainly designed to soften Parliamentary criticism of the P M.ʼs pro-Federal stance. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> did push General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> hard on Federal bombing of civilian targets in Biafra. He did get a promise of a tighter rein on the pilots, which probably means little with the very uncertain Federal discipline between Lagos and the front. The Prime Minister also went on to Addis Ababa to see Haile Selassie and boosted the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> as peace maker. So far as our reports indicate, that too was a polite exchange of familiar views with no real impact on events.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>ʼs plight was most obvious in a last minute effort to schedule a meeting with Biafran leader <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> turned him down flatly. But the refusal was managed with the usual Biafran propaganda skill, allowing back bench critics in Parliament to charge that Wilson himself had mis-handled and squelched the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The British domestic benefits of Wilsonʼs visit are likely to be short-lived. His policy of support for the Federals will make him fair game for the critics as long as the war lasts -- and even afterward, if he is still in office.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d54-03" facs="d54-03"/>

                            <hi rend="strong">Other Diplomacy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, there are others anxious to play a diplomatic role -- none of them with reasonable prospects. President Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast (undoubtedly with De Gaulleʼs blessing) is trying to bring the two sides together “without pre-conditions.” Yet the Federals donʼt trust pro-Biafran Houphouet even far enough to respond to his pleas.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> is trying to get talks started in Monrovia, Liberia, at a meeting of its Consultative Committee for Nigeria on April 18. But that effort is foundering on tragic-comic obstacles so characteristic of this war: (a) <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> wonʼt come unless <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> stops the bombing and comes himself; (b) <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> wonʼt stop the bombing for military reasons, and wonʼt come because he is getting married on the19th with plans for a honeymoon rather than negotiations with the rebels.</p>
                        <p>This diplomatic minuet means nothing while the Federal offensive is in progress. Both sides remain convinced that victory lies on the battle field rather than at the conference table. Until events persuade them otherwise, there is no chance of authentic negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The U.S. Special Coordinator</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Against this background, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>, our Special Coordinator for Relief, has just returned from a 3-week swing through the area, including a visit to Biafra. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> got generally sympathetic but evasive responses to his urgings to expand relief. Biafra still rejects both daylight flights and a land corridor on military grounds. They seem to be getting just enough food by the current night time airlift to avert a major disaster. They veto any relief arrangement that might offer a military advantage should the Federals violate the exchange point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> is quietly pursuing one outside chance -- a river corridor running up from the coast and entering Biafra on the extreme east side of the perimeter. This would run through an area which has been relatively free of fighting and of no strategic concern to either party. Even if the military obstacle is cleared away, however, there are still major problems of politics and logistics. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> obviously has his work cut out for him, and plans to go back to the area next week to do some more quiet bargaining.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> appointment seems to have satisfied amply its public relations role here at home. The Congressional critics and public lobbies on Biafran relief have been tolerably quiet for the first time in months.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">The Prospects</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All this adds up to a probable continuation of the war at least through the spring and summer. If the Federals donʼt force a military decision now -- and the odds are against that -- the rainy season coming in May and June will forestall another all-out push until late summer.</p>
                        <p>One general prospect at least seems clear: every passing day increases the war weariness and political unrest on the Federal side, while it strengthens Biafran morale. And though there is no real sign of it now, a lengthening war is also bound to give Federal backers -- the Soviets as well as the harried British -- second thoughts. The least vulnerable party in the Nigerian tangle is the one who has invested less and influenced more than any other -- General De Gaulle.</p>

                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d56-02" facs="d56-02"/>Conversation with Ambassador Ahoua of the Ivory Coast</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ahoua came to see me at the request of President Houphouet-Boigny whom he saw a few days ago in Geneva. He wanted to bring me up to date on several points he had discussed with me at a previous meeting a few weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>(1) President Houphouet-Boigny believes that the Biafran problem is becoming increasingly important as the Soviet influence in Nigeria is gaining ascendancy over the British influence. Houphouet-Boigny believes that the present Nigerian regime no longer has full control of the government and that aid to Biafra is important in stopping the spread of Soviet influence in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>(2) Houphouet-Boigny says the Soviet strategy in West Africa is to work with the UAR on the Moslem populations of Northern Nigeria and the other Saharan states which are Moslem. Arabic rather than English is now being taught in many of the schools in the northern region.</p>
                        <p>(3) According to Houphouet-Boigny, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> sent a confidential emissary to see him to discuss and get suggestions as to how Britain could disengage from her firm commitment to Nigeria since Britain also is now beginning to fear the rise of Soviet influence.</p>
                        <p>(4) Houphouet-Boigny has been having secret conversations with the governments of South Africa and Rhodesia in an effort to persuade them to support Biafra. The South African Government has agreed to such support and is providing a credit of $2,000,000 for supplies and food for the Biafrans. This aid will not be revealed officially and will not go through International Red Cross sources. The South African Government justification is based on concern of the Sovietsʼ growing influence in Nigeria and their feeling that it would be just as well for the Biafrans to remain independent of this influence.</p>
                        <p>(5) The relations of the Ivory Coast Government and the South African Government are becoming increasingly cordial. Their <pb n="3" xml:id="d56-03" facs="d56-03"/>discussions have related particularly to the Biafran question but are also related to possible reopening of diplomatic relations between the two countries. At present, Houphouet-Boigny proposes to defer such recognition till after November when his Congress will meet and when he will have a chance to prepare the country for such a move. It is his belief that South Africa is rethinking their international relations more along political lines and less along racial lines. He believes that this could have an impact on their attitude to apartheid over a period of time.</p>
                        <p>(6) President Houphouet-Boigny feels that Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> is so committed in his attitude toward the Nigerian Government that he is taking a rather rigid position on the question of Biafra. He feels that a new look on the whole question of Biafra and Nigeria is badly needed and that a change in the department would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>(7) President Houphouet-Boigny is now less sanguine about other African nations recognizing the South African Government promptly than he was earlier. This is due partly to the fact that most of the leaders do not have too strong a position in their countries and some of them are Marxist oriented. He believes, however, that there will be a gradual evolution in this direction. He specially indicated that President Zinsou lacks authority in Dahomey, one reason being that a large part of his population is Uruba, which is tied in with the northern region of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>(8) The other countries which are presently helping Biafra are France, Gabon, Tanzania, Zambia and Israel. Houphouet-Boigny believes that Tunisia will be recognizing Biafra shortly.</p>
                        <p>(9) Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK2">Dike</persName> of Biafra, who saw me at the request of President Houphouet-Boigny a few weeks ago, will be returning to the United States in a week or two with certain concrete proposals.</p>

In order to keep our initiative and to guard the secrecy of these negotiations this office has refused to discuss surface corridors and in cooperation with the Dutch Foreign Office has encouraged countries participating <pb n="3" xml:id="d57-03" facs="d57-03"/>in the “Luns Plan Group” to discuss only daylight flights. In the meantime, contacts with both sides are being maintained in order to move as rapidly as possible to the second phase of negotiations -- the choice of an African site and an agreed date to bring both sides together.</item>

                        <p>During a four hour dinner conversation, the three Biafran representatives put forward the Biafran case and sought US official support for Biafra. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK2">Kenneth Dike</persName> was also to be present, but another engagement intervened.</p>
                        <p>Taking turns, all three Biafran representatives defended Biafraʼs claim to sovereignty. They cited the 1966 massacres in the North and rejection of Ibos by the Nigerian Federation which then refused to allow them to go in peace. Claiming that no military solution is possible, and that, indeed, the military situation is “irrelevant”, they insisted that the Biafrans would never give in.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NE2">Njoku</persName> made the point that as Nigerian citizens able to travel and settle outside of Iboland by right, Ibos would continue to be subject to hostility and eventual massacre, which would not be the case if they had the protection of a foreign nationality, namely Biafran. The three stated categorically that the Ibo people do not wish to repeat their recent experience in the Federation and, in any event, the Nigerian Federation could not endure the tribal rivalry which will inevitably destroy it. They dismissed Gowon as one whose assurances of safety to the Ibos could not be believed. They said that basically the question to be resolved is Ibo security.</p>
                        <p>Getting down to their principle reason for being here, they stated it as their assumption that the US cannot stand by doing nothing while blood continues to be uselessly shed in the Nigerian conflict. They <pb n="2" xml:id="d59-02" facs="d59-02"/>proposed, therefore, that the US assert its moral authority by unilaterally calling for an arms embargo and cease fire to be followed by suitable steps to see to it that arms suppliers to both sides agree to suspend deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The present US policy of political non-intervention, while humanitarian assistance to the civilian victims of the war continues was reiterated. It was made very clear to the Biafrans that the US Government is determined to avoid direct involvement in what it regards as an internal and African matter.</p>
                        <p>The visitors all professed to understand that the consequences of the Vietnam war and developments at home have not disposed the American people or Government to new foreign ventures. They insisted, however, that a call for an arms embargo would not constitute political intervention, even though it was pointed out to them that such action could have a baneful affect on our relations with Nigeria and Britain. They were unconvinced that we might have no influence on Soviet or French policy and, little more on the British at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>At no point in the discussion did the Biafrans concede that the Eastern minorities problem is meaningful. They felt that the non-Ibos in the former Eastern Region would support Biafra if a plebiscite were held, but that even if this were not the case, a Biafra consisting solely of the Ibo heartland would be viable. This area would include Port Harcourt and the bulk of the oil lands, which Lagos includes in the new Rivers State.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NE2">Njoku</persName>, as a trained botanist, was asked about Biafran food prospects. He said the rains had started earlier this year and this meant that the carbohydrate shortage would be well on the way to resolution as the new crop would be available by June 1. The maize at that time would be followed by yams. Meanwhile the protein shortage was being handled by the food on the relief flights. He thought the intensified campaign to grow more would permit Biafra to meet the problem in the future. The Biafrans were reluctant to discuss relief and the food problem except in the context of urging those seeking to help to devote their energy to ending what they considered the basic cause, the fighting.</p>
                        <p>It was very clear throughout the eveningʼs animated but friendly discussion that the Biafran spokesmen remain convinced of the validity of their position. Further, they stated that they wanted to make every effort to convince the US of the wisdom of seeking an early cease fire, arms embargo, and an end to the war. This clearly implied Biafran independence.</p>

                        <p>You should be aware that the Congressional chorus on Nigeria-Biafra may be rising again. There has been a clear moratorium on the subject since Clyde <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs appointment as Special Coordinator. But apparently the critics were only waiting for Ferguson to return essentially empty-handed from his first trip to the war zone.</p>
                        <p>We now have reports from the Hill of a high-powered new organization to bring together private and Congressional personalities. It would be called “Americans for Biafran Relief..” The moving spirits include Senators <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> (taking the lead), Pearson, Goodell; Congressmen Lukins, Fraser, Lowenstein; and various private figures in the relief effort such as Katherine Menninger, Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName> of Catholic Relief, and Fulton Lewis III. The broader membership pulls out all the stops: the JCʼs, the Young Republican and Young Democrat Federations, and religious relief bodies.</p>
                        <p>I gather the group will assemble on the Hill today to issue a “manifesto” criticizing U.S. policy and perhaps calling for political mediation of the civil war. There have also been plans for a student “fast-in” around the country to save money for Biafran relief.</p>
                        <p>Itʼs not clear yet how far this group will go in mixing politics with relief. Senator Pearson, for example, has argued against U.S. political involvement in Nigeria. It is plain, however, that the pressure will build up again for some more dramatic step on relief or stopping the war.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing an earlier basic memo on the Biafran problem, including a run-down of our major options.</p>

                        <p>According to a fairly reliable source French officials estimate that an average of 20-40 tons of arms a day have gone into Biafra since March 31, more than during any comparable period since the Nigerian conflict began. Included in these calculations were arms derived from two French commercial shipments and a French military aircraft to Gabon. Another source reports that the Biafrans are continuing their efforts to obtain fighter-bomber aircraft.</p>

In addition a merchant ship carrying sizable quantities of Algerian arms is said to have sailed for Lagos a week ago.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> stated that he had come in to continue the discussion started by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> in London on April 22nd. He stated that the question of a surface corridor had been studied by Government officials in Lagos and it had been decided in the highest councils that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> should cooperate as fully as possible with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>. Therefore, after study it had been decided that the Cross River surface corridor was all right in principle. In particular, the Government could approve the use of LSMʼs carrying goods up the Cross River to Ikot Okporo. The question of a road route to the ferry crossing at Ikot Okporo presented some problems, since the road and its feeder lines might not be able to carry the full relief effort and still be used as a communications link by the Nigerian Army. This could possibly affect the security of the Southeast State.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> further stated that with regard to the use of LSMʼs on the Cross River route, the Nigerian admiralty would have no problem about inspection at Lagos. Arrangements could be worked out for inspection somewhere other than the port at <pb n="2" xml:id="d63-02" facs="d63-02"/>Lagos-Apapa. He mentioned that, in fact, it might be good for the Nigerian Navy to observe the use of LSMʼs in action. And he indicated that they had to look forward to the day when there would be no Biafran enclave, and the Federal Government would itself be interested in using LSMʼs to bring relief and rehabilitation into the area. He also indicated that there might be other surface corridors which would be feasible, provided that the hostility of the local population to the movement of goods along such waterways into Biafra would not prevent their use.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> welcomed this information and stated that we would be in a position to utilize the Cross River route by June 1st; that the equipment would be in place by that time. With regard to a truck route to Ikot Okporo, he said that his staff had carefully examined this road and felt that a truck route would not interfere with existing military communications and that the road could be maintained to bear such heavy traffic. He felt that the question of inspection could be worked out for example by allowing a naval-boarding at sea before the goods entered the Cross River. The need for the LSMʼs to move relief goods, no matter how the military situation developed, was expressed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> then stated that he had heard that the church groups were pressing for two more C-97ʼs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> confirmed that whereas previously he had heard rumors that they wished to obtain two more C-97ʼs, he had now received a firm request. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said that Lagos would have “a sharp reaction” to any further contribution of planes to the relief effort. He pointed out that the church groups (not the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>) were operating illegally over Nigerian territory. He further stated that his Government was not interested in whether or not the planes were an actual addition to the original four or whether they would replace one or more cannibalized planes. Further, his Government would not be interested in <pb n="3" xml:id="d63-03" facs="d63-03"/>a trade-off in which the Nigerian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission would receive a like donation of planes. He protested that Omo-Bare had no need for planes.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out that Uli Airfield is a military target and he claimed that the Federal Army would soon take it. At that point, presumably it would not be possible to fly relief goods into Biafra and we would have to rely on a surface corridor. He made it increasingly clear throughout the conversation that favorable progress on the Cross River route would depend on how we handled the C-97ʼs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> raised the question of airdrops as one which had been given increasing publicity. Ambassador Tyalla responded immediately that the Federal Government would never accept airdrops because they could not assure that weapons would not be airdropped, too. He conceded readily, however, that airdrops from planes flying from Lagos was a different matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> would be able to travel to Lagos and indicated that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> was anxious that he return to discuss relief routes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said that Congressional relations had kept him in Washing-ton, but that he expected to return to Lagos during the last two weeks in May and would remain for extensive discussions with Government officials.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended with some discussion of the hearings before the Diggsʼ Subcommittee. The Ambassador stated that he had two of his staff members present at the hearings, and had been very pleased at the way the hearings went. He was interested in getting a large number of copies of the hearings as soon as they were published and we promised to take care of his needs.</p>

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>THE FIRST ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT (<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>) WILL WIN THE WAR. OUR REASONING ON THIS POINT IS SET FORTH IN LAGOS 2775 OF MARCH 28, 1969. SINCE THAT TIME THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> HAS TAKEN UMUAHIA AND LOST OWERRI, BUT WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE SCALES ARE SO WEIGHTED IN FAVOR OF THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> THAT AN <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> VICTORY IS INEVITABLE. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING BUT AN <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> VICTORY, MILITARY OR NEGOTIATED, PROMISES TO FRAGMENT NIGERIA, PROLONG STRIFE, AND PROBABLY HAVE <pb n="2" xml:id="d64-02" facs="d64-02"/>REPERCUSSIONS IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES (LAGOS A-171, APRIL 17, 1969).</item>

                            <item>THE SECOND ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE PRESENT MULTI-STATE STRUCTURE OF NIGERIA HAS GIVEN A NEW STABILITY TO THE COUNTRY WHICH AFFORDS HER THE MEANS TO RIDE OUT THE WAR AND THEREAFTER TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMS OF REINTEGRATION OF THE IBOS, REHABILITATION, AND DEMOBILIZATION. IT WOULD, HOWEVER, BE A MISTAKE TO UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTIES AND THE DANGERS OF THE IMMEDIATE POSTWAR PERIOD.</item>

                            <item>A THIRD ASSUMPTION IS THAT NIGERIA WILL NOT FALL INTO A PATTERN OF RECURRING COUPS WHICH COULD SPLIT THE COUNTRY WIDE OPEN (LAGOS A-151 APRIL 5, 1969). WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT IN GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName>, A MINORITIES MAN FROM THE MIDDLE BELT AND AN IDEALISTIC PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER, THE COUNTRY HAS COME UP WITH THE CLOSEST THING TO THE REQUISITE COMPROMISE LEADER. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AND WELCOMED AND CONSTITUTES A MAJOR SAFEGUARD TO THE STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY. COUPS CAN, OF COURSE, COME OUT OF NOWHERE. AS OF THIS WRITING COL. BENJAMIN ADEKUNLE, COMMANDER OF THE 3RD MARINE COMMANDO DIVISION, IS POSING A PROBLEM. (LAGOS 3878). IF <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> FEELS OBLIGED TO RELIEVE HIM THERE COULD BE REPERCUSSIONS, BUT THERE IS AT LEAST A PRECEDENT IN THE FORMAL REMOVAL OF COL. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">MURTALA MOHAMED IN</persName>.

                            <item>IF THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE VALID, THE PROMISE ONCE SHOWN BY NIGERIA HAS THE MEANS OF REALIZATION: THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY. AS POINTED OUT IN LAGOS A-171, THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY WELL MANAGED AND HAS WITHSTOOD THE STRAINS OF WAR WITHOUT FALTERING. OIL PRODUCTION HAS PASSED THE PRE-WAR LEVEL AND IS EXPECTED BY 1973 TO PROVIDE POUNDS NIGERIA 240 MILLION IN GOVERNMENT REVENUES AND SOME POUNDS NIGERIAN 290 MILLION IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.</item>

                            <item>WE BELIEVE THAT THE MILITARY REGIME WILL FEEL OBLIGED TO REMAIN IN POWER FOR SOME TIME, POSSIBLY SEVERAL YEARS, AFTER THE END OF HOSTILITIES. THE COUNTRY IS NOW RUN BY A KITCHEN CABINET RATHER THAN THROUGH ITS ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS, THE SUPREME MILITARY COUNCIL AND THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. WHILE THE KITCHEN CABINET IS PREPONDERANTLY MILITARY, <pb n="3" xml:id="d64-03" facs="d64-03"/>IT INCLUDES SOME OF THE MORE CAPABLE SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS.

THE TRANSITION, WHEN IT COMES, WILL SEVERELY TEST THE STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY, AND WE SUSPECT THAT THE MILITARY WILL STAY CLOSE AT HAND IN THE TURKISH MANNER.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>IN SUM, THE EMBASSY HAS EMERGED FROM ITS STUDY OF THE INSTITUTIONS, LEADERSHIP, AND ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> ON BALANCE WITH A FAVORABLE PROGNOSIS. THERE ARE UNQUESTIONABLY DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD, BUT THE CHANCES ARE THAT NIGERIA CAN RESUME THE ROLE SHE SEEMED DESTINED TO PLAY WHEN SHE BECAME INDEPENDENT.<lb/>GP-1</item>

                            <item>Status Report on Nigerian Civil War</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Not surprisingly, the situation in Nigeria remains very fluid and uncertain in the wake of the latest Federal offensive. I thought it would be useful to keep you posted with another brief wrap-up of the major developments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Military Action</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Federalsʼ “final push” is now nearly a month old. They did succeed in capturing the Biafran capital of Umuahia, which was a diplomatic blow to the rebels. And the evacuation of the capital did temporarily hobble Biafraʼs internal administration, including food distribution. All our intelligence now suggests, however, that the Federal offensive has ground to an indecisive and even perilous halt after carving out a relatively small pocket in the secessionist enclave. The rebels are still contesting their losses with heavy fighting in and around Umuahia. Biafran forces may, in fact, be cutting the Federal supply line to the capital. The Federal offensive still had a numerical and logistical superiority, yet they seem to have driven to Umuahia only to be threatened with envelopment by rebel counter-attacks. At the very least, a rebel blockade or recapture of Umuahia would be a telling blow to Federal prestige.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile (and equally ironic in light of the talk of a “final push”) the Biafrans have scored impressive victories on the southern front. They have recaptured the town of Owerri (normally a much more important possession than Umuahia). They are now driving southward to pose some threat to the Federal hold on Port Harcourt, the main supply depot for the Federal forces and the most important single objective on any front of the war.</p>
                        <p>There is an added complication on the southern front because Biafran advances also threaten Nigerian oil production, which is a principal source of foreign exchange for the Federals. So far, the rebels have not sabotaged the big and vulnerable British Shell refineries or the crucial Trans-Niger pipeline -- probably in the hope of recapturing them intact. But they might do a token raid just to establish their capability for political reasons.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d65-02" facs="d65-02"/>
                        <p>Again, a credible Biafran threat to Port Harcourt or the oil production would be a blow to Federal morale and generally tarnish Nigeriaʼs image among African and other supporters (such as the British and Soviets) who are increasingly impatient with the continuation of this war. (I am attaching two maps showing military deployment and the threat to the oil.)</p>
                        <p>The fact remains, as always, that the Federal side has the men and materiel to prevail militarily in the end. Logistically, Biafra cannot win a war of attrition. But rebel resilience and staying power, embellished by Federal ineptitude, could still prolong the fighting to the point of political, if not material, exhaustion on the Federal side. The key military factor is still the continuation of the arms air lift to Biafra made possible largely through clandestine French support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Diplomacy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The indecision on the battlefield is mirrored in a diplomatic stale-mate between the two sides. As you may recall, the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> --with <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> and President Tubman the moving spirits -- tried again in late April to get talks started in Liberia. The Biafrans said they were ready to negotiate “without preconditions”, yet held out for a cease-fire before sitting down. The Federals, optimistic about their offensive, sent a second-level delegation to Monrovia and didnʼt budge either.</p>
                        <p>There are several African initiatives awash following the Monrovia failure. Tubman and Houphouet-Boigny are trying to mount a concerted approach to each side by friendly parties. Brigadier Afrifa, the new Head of State in Ghana, plans a demarche to both sides to get talks started quietly in Accra.</p>
                        <p>African peace-making in this war, however, has been more talk than action. Much as the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> parades its special mandate (and expects outsiders to accept it), they have failed on two important counts:</p>
                        <p>(1) Sooner or later, the majority bias for the Federal side shows through. In short, the Biafrans need some evidence of African pressure on the Feds to establish the credibility of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> as an authentic “mediator.”</p>
                        <p>(2) Initiatives are left at pious pronouncements on “reconciliation” without getting to the core question of Biafran protection among her hostile tribal neighbors in the would-be Federation. The Africans should have grasped the nettle and proposed specific arrangements to flush out both sides on details. At least that would have cleared away some of the propaganda and ambiguity that so plagues the diplomatic scene.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d65-03" facs="d65-03"/>
                        <p>But then even the most energetic and imaginative initiative would still face the toughest obstacle to talks: both sides still think they can win on the battlefield what they might have to forego if they came now to the conference table. The course of this war is certainly capricious, and we should remember the two sides could always blossom over night with some unpredictable (and typically African) accommodation. But there is no hard sign of that at this point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Federal Politics</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Adding to his military troubles, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has now moved to replace his unsuccessful and allegedly corrupt commanders on the southern and western fronts. One of these--Colonel ADEKUNLE--is still a popular figure and the ouster is shaking the delicate tribal and regional balance in the Federal coalition. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> can probably weather this crisis, but the long-run durability of the coalition and war effort is still open to doubt.</p>
                        <p>Among other things, the replacement of the Division Commanders rules out any Federal offensive in those sectors for several weeks, and may create enough disarray to allow substantial Biafran gains. That he took the political risk to make a switch, however, indicates <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs resignation to a prolonged fight.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief and U.S. Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Amid all this pulling and hauling, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> is quietly trying to negotiate a surface corridor that could bring a major expansion of relief to Biafra. The route would run from Calabar on the coast up a navigable river and into the eastern half of the rebel enclave. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> has done a good deal of preliminary work on logistics, and he leaves again for the area this weekend to nail down actual relief talks between the parties.</p>
                        <p>The nightly airlift of food continues to ward off massive starvation in Biafra, but the margin is close. The <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> corridor -- which probably has a 50-50 chance--would help enormously. Iʼll keep you closely informed of <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs mission as it enters the critical stage next week.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, State is working on contingency planning for the prospects of continuing stalemate, actual negotiations, collapse on either side etc. I am satisfied thus far that our policy is being carried out with the political non-involvement and basic neutrality (standing clear of the Federals) which you instructed. It may be useful later in the summer, however, to take another look-at our options -- primarily to ensure they remain open, but also to examine any new possibility that we could or should play a more active role in helping to bring this war to an end.</p>

                        <p>Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName> has requested that the U.S. Government sell to Joint Church Aid (USA) two additional C-97ʼs in order to increase the total number of C-97ʼs available to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> for airlifting relief supplies into the Biafran enclave. Originally, we sold to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> at a nominal price four C-97ʼs despite the active opposition of the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Federal Government is presently aware of <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>ʼs request for two additional planes and has made its firm opposition to the sale known to the Department. The Nigerian Government explicitly linked present negotiations concerning a surface corridor with any sale of the additional aircraft to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>. Negotiations on a surface corridor are now in an active phase and we have assurances that the Nigerian Government is prepared to approve a surface corridor plan.</p>
                        <p>Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName> is aware of our problem of releasing C-97ʼs at this time. Extensive conversations have been held with his principal officer in charge of the airlift, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KEM2">Edward Kinney</persName>, and James MacCracken, Director of Church World Services, which is a principal partner of Catholic Relief Services in the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> operation. We have been exploring with them ways to maximize the use of their present complement of aircraft without actually increasing <pb n="2" xml:id="d66-02" facs="d66-02"/>the size of the complement. At the same time, we are examining ways of improving their financial position. They, on their part, are exploring the possibility of procuring commercial aircraft, particularly aircraft of foreign registry.</p>
                        <p>Since Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName>ʼs request for two additional aircraft was received, one <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> C-97 crashed while landing at Uli Airport. The crew was not injured, but the aircraft as a result of the crash was a total loss. We have anticipated arequest for a replacement for this aircraft and have decided to make available a replacement for the lost C-97, as stated in the attached letter to Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>For your background information, prior to the introduction of the four C-97ʼs in January of this year, the total Sao Tome air fleet included six DC-6ʼs, two DC-7ʼs, one C-46, and one Constellation all flying an average of 70 tons nightly into Uli airfield. With the introduction of the four C-97ʼs, two DC-6ʼs and two DC-7ʼs were dropped. Severe C-97 supply and maintenance problems resulted, however, in an initial net decrease in tons flown; but with refinements in the support system and extensive help from the U.S. Air Force in finding parts, these planes have now become a major ingredient of the airbridge. Airlift capacity has recently been averaging 160 tons per night.</p>
                        <p>Because of the close relations which already exist between Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, <pb n="3" xml:id="d66-03" facs="d66-03"/>and the possibility that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> should brief Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName> more fully on the negotiations surrounding a surface relief corridor, it is felt that a reply to the Bishopʼs cable should be made by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>. Moreover, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> has already replied to an earlier cable from the Bishop concerning the same subject.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you approve the attached reply to Bishop <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Swanstrom</persName> for signature by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>.</p>

                        <p>AIDE MEMOIRE</p>
                        <p>The Office of the Special Coordinator on Relief to the Civilian Victims of the Nigerian Civil War has the honor to present to His Excellency, the Ambassador of Nigeria, the following communication which is being presented simultaneously to his Government in Lagos.</p>
                        <p>“Dear General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Recently one of the four C-97 aircraft sold by the USG to the Joint Church Aid relief group crashed while delivering relief supplies at Uli Airport. The plane suffered damage to such an extent that it will be impossible to return it to operational condition.</p>
                        <p>I have received a request from the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> group for a C-97 to replace the destroyed aircraft. Since the original intent of the agreement with Joint Church Aid, which was communicated to your Government, was that the United States Government would maintain <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>ʼs operational capacity at four C-97ʼs, we have an obligation to provide <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> with a replacement for the lost plane.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d67-02" facs="d67-02"/>
                        <p>The decision to replace the destroyed C-97 is, of course, entirely separate from any decision concerning the two additional C-97ʼs requested by <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>-USA in order to augment their present operational fleet. As you are aware, a decision on this matter is in abeyance because of my own strong conviction that a better solution to the relief problem can be found. At the invitation of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>, I shall be coming to Lagos about the 23rd of this month to continue discussions on the Cross River and other surface corridors.</p>
                        <p>Let me again express my personal appreciation for the humane concern evinced by yourself and your Government for the welfare of all of the people of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p rend="right">With best wishes and sincere regards,<lb/>C. Clyde Ferguson, Jr.”</p>
                        <p>Please accept the assurance of our highest consideration.</p>

                            <item>Your Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Pius Okigbo</persName> (o-KEEG-bo) Biafran Special Representative -- 4:30 p.m. today</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I think you are up to date on the more important military and political developments of the Nigerian war. (A copy of our latest status report to the President is attached; as a history refresher, I have also attached my first memo on Nigeria.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Okigbo</persName> is one of Biafraʼs roving ambassador sent out to scare ip more sympathy and support. Typically, he is urbane, articulate, clever and persistent. He was Nigeriaʼs Ambassador to the Common Market prior to secession, wrote the definitive book on Africa and the Market, is a first-rate economist who would be a prized for any university here. (<persName corresp="#p_OP1">Okigbo</persName> is being accompanied by Dr. Otue (0-tu-way), the Biafran officed unofficially in New York.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Okigbo</persName> understands clearly that he is doing the talking at this session, while we only listen politely. He will quickly slide over relief -- if he touches it at all -- to the political problem. There is the standard recital of atrocities against the Ibos, bad faith of the Federals, and the unwavering determination of the Biafrans to fight to the death. (There is also a usual warning of rising Soviet influence in Federal Nigeria. ) <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Okigbo</persName>ʼs favorite line is that sovereignty is the only authentic guarantee that the Ibos will survive as a people in West Africa.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Okigbo</persName> will probably press home two points:</p>
                        <p>--The Feds canʼt win militarily. The <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and their other friends (Britain and Russia) canʼt--or wonʼt--convince Lagos of the folly of continued fighting.<lb/>--The U.S. is the only third party left with decisive influence. At best, we should try to mediate. At least, we should demonstrably climb off the Federal side and be truly impartial on the issue of secession. (What they want, in effect is a public statement that we no longer have an interest in ”one Nigeria“. )</p>
                        <p>It would waste time to challenge <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Okigbo</persName> on his substantive points, though most are open to serious question. I recommend you confine your response to the following:</p>

                            <item>You thought it useful and fair to give the Biafrans a hearing on these issues. We assume their absolute discretion about this meeting.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The President has made our position very clear on the civil war. We are concerned to do all we can on relief. That is what <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> is doing and we hope Biafra will cooperate in these efforts.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>But we donʼt think it serves anyoneʼs interest for the U.S. to become embroiled in the bitterly disputed political questions in the conflict.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>We will continue to watch developments in Nigeria and Biafra very closely. The Biafrans should know that there are ample ways to convey their views or information to responsible people in this Government.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>At this point we simply hope that both sides in the war would resolve to try negotiations. No outsider can force that decision. But Biafra strengthens her case most effectively by being as reasonable and conciliatory as possible in getting talks started.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>You should be aware that we could face in the next couple of weeks a nasty little run-in with the Feds over relief flights.</p>
                        <p>The problem stems from the growing frustration on the Federal side as the war drags on. Lagos has been predictably testy during the last few weeks as their offensive stalled and the Biafrans made major gains on the southern front. But feelings have come to the flash point with the dramatic appearance a few days ago of a Biafran “airforce.” Piloted by Swedish mercenaries and armed with French rockets, 5 or 6 tiny piper cubs have hit hard at the Nigerian Air Force in surprise raids on Federal bases around the perimeter -- more damage in a week than Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s and Ilyushins managed in two years. (These little planes symbolize all too vividly the tragic-comic plight of the Feds. The Swedish pilots serve Biafra with an ardor Lagos canʼt even muster among its own people (let alone the seemingly myopic Egyptians whoʼve been flying Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s). Then too, the one-seaters are a brilliant improvisation perfectly suited to the rustic technology of this war. While sophisticated Soviet jets dart around hitting hospitals and villages, the cubs lumber along at tree-top with simple but telling accuracy. Biafran air raids are thus an embarrassing mockery of Federal leadership as well as a military threat.)</p>
                        <p>The Feds could save face by (1) shopping for small prop planes of their own or (2) diverting attention with an offensive somewhere along the perimeter. There is evidence that they may be planning both. But the planes will take time, and the offensive is also time-consuming and all but foredoomed. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> needs a dramatic gesture now.</p>
                        <p>That leaves what has always been the most obvious and vulnerable scapegoat of Federal frustration -- the relief airlift. You will remember that the food flights go into Biafra only at night under the auspices of the International Red Cross and religious voluntary agencies. The Feds have suspected all along that the voluntary agencies were running guns. In any case, the relief flights do constitute, willy nilly, a cover for the French arms flights which also come in at night.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d69-02" facs="d69-02"/>
                        <p>So far, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has sullenly tolerated the relief airlift -- ostensibly for moral reasons, though the decision was made easier by the knowledge that his own mercenary pilots would have considerable difficulty with moving targets. Now, however, he is pressed by wounded pride as well as xenophobia. And even without a conscious decision to bar relief flights, some jittery Federal pilot could take on a Red Cross or church transport.</p>
                        <p>Whether by declaration or action, a Federal outlawing of relief flights would surely bring us some tough decisions. The Biafra lobby here would find new life and press for Presidential intervention. Our choice might boil down to acquiescence in a relief blockade or some kind of open confrontation with the Feds.</p>
                        <p>There is still the chance that cooler heads, few as they are, will prevail in Lagos. But I wanted to alert you to the more unpleasant possibilities. I have State hard at work on planning for a crisis of this sort</p>
                        <p>-- Including some fast acceleration of <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>ʼs relief negotiations which might yet yield a surface corridor to substitute for the night airlift.</p>
                        <p>Iʼm afraid, though, that this episode is only symptomatic. As long as this war continues, not even our low profile will shield us from some sizable brickbats both there and here.</p>

                        <p>On June 5, an <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> airplane was shot down by a Nigerian <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> while en route to Biafra with relief supplies. Two of the crew of the plane, a DC-7, are reported to have parachuted and to be in Nigerian military custody at Uyo. The crew consisted of an American pilot, a Swedish co-pilot, a Norwegian flight engineer and a Swedish loadmaster. It is not yet known which two parachuted, northe fate of the other two.</p>
                        <p>Our Chargeʼ in Lagos immediately called on External Affairs Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>, who appeared “visibly shaken” and confirmed that General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> had given strict orders that relief planes were not to be attacked in the air. The Nigerian Air Force commander described the downed plane as suspected of being a DC-6 gunrunner.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is suspending relief flights for the night of June 6/7 pending clarification of the situation. On June 4/5, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> had landed 18 planes at Uli without incident. The <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> operation from Sao Tome completed 11 flights to Uli during the night of June 5/6. <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> has not yet reported any plans for interruption of their operations from Sao Tome.</p>
                        <p>In London, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> consulted with British officials, who are planning to urge the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> in an investigation of the incident and to include in any public statement renewed offers of cooperation on surface corridors and daylight relief flights.</p>
                        <p>At the noon briefing today, our spokesman issued a statement of deep regret and deplored the attack. On background, he also explained the problems arising from the intermingling of relief and arms flights.</p>

                        <p>Nigeria - Attack on <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> Planes</p>
                        <p>The United States has learned with deep regret of the attack by the Nigerian Air Force on one and possibly more transport aircraft carrying relief supplies into Biafra. The exact number of aircraft involved and the circumstances are not yet clear. We are urgently seeking details.</p>
                        <p>The United States has taken a clear position with regard to relief in the Nigerian civil war. We have drawn a sharp distinction between the political issues underlying the conflict and humanitarian relief to both sides. We have consistently avoided military and direct political involvement in the war. At the same time, however, we have played a leading role in the international effort to reduce suffering on both sides. The American people have contributed generously to this cause.</p>
                        <p>We have on a number of occasions urged Nigeria to take precautions which would avoid the dangers of action against relief operations. While recognizing the problem created by the intermingling of arms flights and relief flights, the United States Government deplores this attack.</p>
                        <p>This incident underlines the urgency of alternative relief arrangements for daylight flights and surface corridors. This has been the mission of Ambassador C. Clyde Ferguson, our Special Coordinator for relief, who has been working with both sides to this end.</p>

                        <p>ON BACKGROUND, to see this attack in perspective, the following factors must be borne in mind:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Arms flights and relief flights are intermingled. Both utilize the same major Biafran airstrip, both use similar flight patterns over Nigerian territory to reach it, and both operate only at night.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Thus, there is danger of confusion between the relief flights and the arms airlift, under conditions in which both the approaches and the Biafran airstrip are major military targets for Federal Nigeria. Any Nigerian attempt to intercept an arms flight runs the risk of hitting the relief planes.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We have long been conscious of these dangers. We have reportedly urged both sides to reach agreement on daylight relief flights and surface corridors. This would not only increase the flow of relief supplies into Baifra but would avoid the present and extremely dangerous comingling of relief and arms flights which led to this tragic in incident.</item>

                        <p>2. BEGIN TEXT:</p>
                        <p>THE ATTENTION OF THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DRAWN TO THE STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES AND SWEDISH GOVERNMENTS PURPORTING TO DEPLORE ATTACK ON AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL TRAFFIC TO POCKETS OF TERRITORY HELD BY FORCES IN ARMED REBELLION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d73-02" facs="d73-02"/>
                        <p>THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT DEPLORES BOTH STATEMENTS, WHICH CLEARLY REVEAL THE DOUBLE STANDARDS AND HYPOCRISY OF BOTH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OVER THE NIGERIAN CRISIS AND THE CLANDESTINE SUPPORT WHICH THE SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS GIVE TO SUSTAIN THE REBELLION AND WEAKEN NIGERIA.</p>
                        <p>OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName> HAS COMTEMPTUOUSLY TREATED THE WORLD TO A MACABRE DISPLAY: FIRST, MURDERING ELEVEN FOREIGN OIL TECHNICIANS IN COLD BLOOD AND, THEN, ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION TO MURDER EIGHTEEN OTHERS.</p>
                        <p>NO EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT NOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FELT MOVED ENOUGH TO DEPLORE SUCH CRIMES: RATHER, THEY PREFERRED TO ENGAGE IN REGRETTABLE APPEASEMENT AND DEALINGS.</p>
                        <p>NATIONALS OF SWEDEN ACQUIRED MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND BOMBED AND STRAFED AIRPORTS, POWER STATIONS AND OTHER CIVIL INSTALLATIONS, WHILE <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName> BOASTED THAT HE WOULD ATTACK NIGERIAN SHIPPING AND INDUSTRY. SOME OF THE AIRCRAFT WERE REPORTED TO BEAR RED CROSS MARKINGS.</p>
                        <p>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONDEMN SUCH VIOLATIONS BY A EUROPEAN COUNTRY OF NORMAL CIVILIZED CODE OF INTERNATIONAL CONDUCT, ESPECIALLY AS COUNT VON ROSEN AND HIS SWEDES FIRST CAME TO NIGERIA ON SO-CALLED RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS.</p>
                        <p>IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT OJUKWU,S SOURCE OF MONEY, HIS SUPPLIES FOR HIS SOLDIERS, HIS REGULAR CONTACT WITH FOREIGN INTERESTS HOSTILE TO THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF NIGERIA AS ONE COUNTRY ARE ALL ORGANIZED UNDER THE AEGIS OF SO-CALLED RELIEF OPERATIONS.</p>
                        <p>THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT, THEREFORE, WARNS ALL FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO RESPECT NIGERIAʼS SOVEREIGNTY OVER ITS ENTIRE TERRITORY, TO DESIST FROM ORGANIZING OR CONNIVING AT FLIGHTS OPERATED WITHOUT THE EXPRESS AND SPECIFIC APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT AND ANY FURTHER VIOLATION OF NIGERIAN AIR SPACE.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I am afraid I was none too grim in the foreboding I gave you last week about a Federal move against the relief airlift. In the last 48 hours the Feds have begun to talk very tough, and we have intelligence that they may soon have some kind of night-fighter capability--including British mercenary pilots and a radar guidance facility supervised by Soviet personnel.</p>
                        <p>Ostensibly, the interdiction will be aimed at the nightly arms flights. But the Feds suspect the church groups of running guns anyway, and they would just as soon see the Red Cross flights stopped. One way or another, the relief flights will be likely casualties of an interdiction effort.</p>
                        <p>Our Ambassador in Lagos is seeing General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> this morning to try to nail down all the suspicion and reports with a straight answer on Federal intentions. On the basis of that conversation, <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> will send over this evening a complete wrap-up on where we stand and our contingency plans. Meanwhile, as a refresher, here is a brief run-down of the problem and a preview of <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>ʼs report. (I have been directly involved in the planning work with State this week.)</p>
                        <p>

                            <item>The nighttime relief airlift has always provided a species of cover for the Biafran arms flights. That is precisely why <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> doesnʼt buy daylight flights, even at the expense of added tonnage which would save more lives. The Feds have had to tolerate this intermix of arms and relief, however, because they simply lacked the capability for night inter-diction.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Yet stopping the arms supply has always been the key to ending the war. Biafra could not long survive without the steady flow of small arms and ammunition (roughly 200 tons a week). It is just one of the mysteries of this war that the Feds have not moved sooner--on their own or with British or Soviet help--to hire the people and equipment <pb n="2" xml:id="d77-02" facs="d77-02"/>to interdict. Goaded by the failure of their latest “final” offensive (and even some embarrassing Biafran victories in the process), <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> at long last looks as if he will make a serious effort.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>In hard military terms, therefore, the Feds do have legitimate reasons to attack half of the aircraft coming into Biafra at night. Their problem--and ours--is to make sure they tackle the right half.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The ideal solution from the Federal point of view would be an outright embargo on all relief flights, letting the mercenary pilots shoot down anything in their sights. But <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> is apparently aware to some degree that a total relief blockade would be politically disastrous for the Federal side. Thus, he will almost certainly offer some kind of “control” arrangement whereby the Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s could somehow “identify” the relief aircraft. As Lagos sees it, this is a sufficient sop to humanitarian interest, and the relief agencies can take it or leave it at their own risk.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The problem, of course, is that in “control”--as in nearly everything else--the Feds are bound to be tragically inept. The arrangements they envision in the air are signals like waving wings or lowering landing gears. The margin for error here -- with nervous pilots on both sides in the black Equatorial night--I need not describe. As an alternative, the Feds talk about transferring all relief operations to Lagos under their own strict control, which the relief agencies strongly oppose (and justifiably so) as making their operations political and logistical hostages on the Federal side.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In sum, we face a Federal move to interdict arms flights for legitimate military reasons, yet under circumstances which will either amount to (a) a de facto relief embargo or (b) serious danger of shooting down relief aircraft.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The U.S. Reaction</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I readily confess that I am not enchanted with the Federal cause in this civil war. In fact, I spend most of my time at State redressing the policy balance to ensure that we stick closely to the Presidentʼs preference for scrupulous neutrality. On this issue, however, I find it very hard to argue that we should lean too heavily on the Feds for an action we both recognize to be in the interests of ending the war with a Federal victory--the outcome of which the President has concluded, albeit reluctantly, to be in our long-run interests. At the same time, we have to keep the relief supplies going in by some means as long as the need exists. And despite recent reports that the food situation in Biafra is improving, the relief supplies are still crucial.</p>

                        <p>I see the policy problem as finding some way to give the Feds a clear shot at the arms supply if they can do it. Thus we have been thinking about the following scenario:

                                <item>If <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> confirms today that they are going all out for interdiction, we would go back with a very strong demarche to the effect that any attack on relief aircraft, accidental or otherwise, would have grave con-sequences for our relations.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We would then ask <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, in effect, to hold off a few days to give <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> a chance to nail down an alternative relief channel--the surface corridor running up a river from the coast into Biafra--which he has been trying to negotiate with both sides over the last six weeks. So far, the Biafrans have done their usual stall on agreeing to the corridor. But the Feds have agreed in principle, the logistics are manageable, and there is no fighting in the sector to impose legitimate military obstacles.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>We would propose to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> a “one-shot” operation of the corridor--a vessel loaded with medical supplies--to confront the Biafrans with a fait accompli of relief. If that corridor were established, we have assurances from the Joint Church Agencies and Red Cross that they would shift their operations from the nighttime airlift to the surface corridor. This would address the relief problem and simplify <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs interdiction. The one-shot operation can be carried out next week.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>If the Biafrans reject the corridor for any reason (and thatʼs most likely), the United States would publicly fix the blame for the failure of an alternative relief arrangement.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>At this point, the Feds would be in much stronger public position to impose controls on the relief airlift. But those controls must still be as fool proof as possible. We would then consider giving the relief agencies technical help in establishing with the Feds the necessary arrangements.</item>

                                    <p>This boils down to:</p>
                                    <p>-- Telling the Feds they have to wait on interdiction until we force the issue on a surface corridor to get an alternative relief route.<lb/>-- If forcing the issue doesnʼt work, they still have to hold interdiction until the establishment of effective and reasonable controls to distinguish relief from arms flights.<lb/>
                                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d77-04" facs="d77-04"/>-- We put the Biafrans on the spot and save the Feds from political debacle.<lb/>-- Hopefully, we keep the relief going in, despite the constant willingness of both sides to sacrifice it to political and military advantage.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>ʼs memo will probably lay this out in more elaborate detail, but I wanted you to have a rough idea. I see our first job as maintaining relief. Thatʼs the crux, after all, of the public and Congressional pressures. It remains the sole stated purpose of our involvement in the civil war. I think all of us recognize that, under the circumstances, this scenario amounts to helping the Federal side. On the other hand, relief continues per se to keep the rebels going. But the night fighters and mercenary pilots inevitably cut away the purely neutral ground we have been standing on.</p>
                                    <p>As I stressed to you in my first piece on this problem back in January, the hard fact in the politics of relief has been that the Feds do exercise a veto over the food for the rebels. It has been relatively easy to stay neutral and noble as long as the Feds either couldnʼt or wouldnʼt make that veto effective. We may have come to the end of that luxury.</p>

                        <p>GENEVA, LAGOS FOR EARLY A.M. DELIVERY</p>
                        <p>1. Following is text statement issued 4 P.M. June 18 in meeting with press by C. Clyde Ferguson Special Coordinator on relief to victims of Nigerian civil war: QUOTE:</p>
                        <p>The USG is pleased to note that the Federal Military Government and the Biafran authorities have agreed to a surface relief route into Biafra. This corridor has been the subject of intensive multilateral negotiations over the past three months.</p>
                        <p>As a part of its relief effort in Nigeria, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> has undertaken to manage this new relief arrangement. Although some technical details remain to be worked out, it is expected that operations will commence shortly.</p>
                        <p>At the time of my appointment, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated with regard to the problem of supplying relief to the Biafran enclave:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d79-02" facs="d79-02"/>
                        <p>“The major obstacle to expanded relief is neither money, food, nor means of transport. The main problem is the absence of relief arrangements acceptable to the two sides which would overcome the limitations posed by the present hazardous and inadequate nighttime airlift.”</p>
                        <p>This problem has been the focus of my efforts. I have made two trips to each side of the battle lines, have met with representatives of both parties, both here and in other countries, with the representatives of other governments, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, private groups and international organizations in an effort to resolve the problem of obtaining a more secure relief route into the presently land-locked Biafran enclave. New access routes were necessary because the intensification of the war had rendered a night airlift extremely dangerous. Moreover, due to inherent logistic limitations, the airlift was incapable of carrying the tonnages necessary to assure an adequate level of food and medical supplies for the civilian ix victims of this very destructive and tragic war.</p>
                        <p>The airlifts operated by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Joint Church Aid organization have saved countless numbers of people in Biafra from death through malnutrition or actual starvation.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d79-03" facs="d79-03"/>
                        <p>This international effort has testified to a magnificent spirit of humanitarianism. These airlifts have delivered into Biafra tonnages of relief supplies which have run as high as 300 tons per day and are feeding well over two million persons. This has dramatically alleviated starvation and suffering. At the same time, the relief effort by the Federal Military Government and the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> has been feeding over a million people on the Federal side.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the period since the airlift came into being, a number of proposals were advanced, either to assure maximum use of available airlift capacity, or to obtain more secure and larger capacity means of transport. These proposals included a daylight airlift to Uli airstrip, the use of Obilago airfield with a connecting surface corridor into Biafra, a surface corridor from Enugu into the enclave and a water route to Oguta. None of these proposals were acceptable for a variety of military and political reasons.</p>
                        <p>A study of the available surface routes indicated that a corridor up the Cross River offered the greatest promise. This route has sufficient year-round depths to permit the utilization of shipping equipment carrying large tonnages and having shallow drafts. Moreover, the Cross River <pb n="4" xml:id="d79-04" facs="d79-04"/>route has the major advantage of being out of the path of significant military activity and in its upper reaches provides a water barrier between the two sides.</p>
                        <p>Two Landing Ships Medium were located through the efforts of the United States Government and were chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The first of these ships--the Dona Mercedes--will arrive at Lagos Tomorrow. The second is due there in a few days. Both of these ships can navigate the Cross River to Biafran territory and, on one voyage, each of them can carry approximately 900 tons of general cargos the equivalent of some 90 aircraft landings.</p>
                        <p>The first ship, the Dona Mercedes, will be ready within a few days to proceed up the Cross River to the Biafran enclave. Its cargo will be limited for this voyage to urgently needed medical supplies.</p>
                        <p>It should be stressed that for the present these two Landing Ships alone will not be able to meet the full need for relief supplies. It is still necessary that some flights continue, and negotiations toward that end are underway. Furthermore, it is essential that agreement be reached on some of the technical details of the Cross River operation. Neverthe-less, we are greatly encouraged by the actions of the two sides in <pb n="5" xml:id="d79-05" facs="d79-05"/>agreeing to this new relief corridor and believe it represents a major breakthrough. It will assure the continuation of the great humanitarian effort of saving the lives of innocent victims of this conflict. UNQUOTE.<lb/>END</p>

                            <item>Nigerian Crack-down on Relief</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>You should be aware that the Feds have all but kicked out the Red Cross and imposed a de facto embargo on relief flights into Biafra. This is the climax of the mounting frustration and belligerence I have been describing to you over the last three or four weeks.</p>
                        <p>The new hard line was announced yesterday and today in Lagos in a meeting between the Feds and the International Red Cross. The official tack is that the Federal “Rehabilitation Commission” (an organization pretty much in name only) is “relieving” the Red Cross of responsibilities for coordinating a relief effort. In fact, this means:</p>
                        <p>--All relief contributions must be channeled through the Feds.<lb/> -- Decisions on distribution, status of relief workers, etc. are reserved to Lagos.<lb/>--Most important, the Red Cross airlift into Biafra can only operate in daylight and after inspection on Federal territory. Since the Biafrans have objected all along to such daylight flights (as a possible cover for tail-gating <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s to attack the vital Biafran air-strips), this really puts an end to the Red Cross airlift.<lb/>--The other half of the airlift, run by the church relief agencies out of the island of Sao Tome, is declared illegal and subject to military interdiction.</p>
                        <p>Technically, of course, the Feds are well within their rights of sovereignty. And they have probably satisfied what conscience they have by offering daylight flights which the Biafrans cannot accept for security reasons. The practical result is that the Red Cross relief <pb n="2" xml:id="d80-02" facs="d80-02"/>effort will be hamstrung on the Federal side and strangled in Biafra. The food situation in Biafra is not yet as desperate as last summer before the flights began, but the margin is so close that things will get very bad in two or three weeks.</p>
                        <p>For their part at least, the church agencies seem willing to continue their airlift even in the face of increased night activity by Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. Even at that, though, starvation will reappear, and so probably will the public and Congressional pressures on us (particularly if one of those planes from Catholic Relief gets shot down).</p>
                        <p>We were banking, as you know, on <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>ʼs negotiations for a river route into Biafra--if not as a genuine alternative to the air-lift, at least as a tactic to fix the blame on the rebels for obstructing relief and thus give us a defensible public case with Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> et. al. in the Biafra lobby. Now the Feds have even backed away from their agreement “in principle” on the river route. My guess is that the xenophobic hawks in Lagos have won the day amid Federal frustration on the battle field, and they have thrown down the gauntlet to everybody, including us. The truth is they donʼt care either about starving Biafrans or foreign humanitarianism.</p>
                        <p>I have submitted an item for the morning brief to alert the President on this with a capsule rundown. Elliott Richardson is pulling together a review of the new situation, and we should have a paper in the next few days on next steps in our relief policy (if any) and public posture.</p>
                        <p>I would like very much to have about 15 minutes with you on this some time in the next couple of days. Iʼm afraid <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>, and the policy he represents, is at a deadend. We face a basic political choice between tolerable relations with the Feds and continuing relief.</p>

                        <p>In addition to Q and A during scheduled news conference, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> issued today following press release:</p>
                        <p>QTE In view of the present seriousness of the relief problem arising from the Nigerian civil war, I wish to issue the following statement.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning of this conflict, the United States has shared the very deep humanitarian concerns of much of the rest of the world with respect to the civilian victims of this war. We have steadfastly refrained from any involvement in the conflict itself and sought to avoid interference in its politics. We have tried in every way possible to divorce these considerations from the human task of impartially succoring the innocent victims of the war on both sides. All of these considerations led to the very narrowly prescribed mandate we gave to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> as Special Coordinator for these relief efforts when he was appointed to that position on February 22.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d81-02" facs="d81-02"/>
                        <p>There is no reason of a theoretical or practical nature why the humanitarian aspects of this problem cannot be separated from the political and military aspects. But this requires the cooperation of the two parties and of the international community in adhering to certain fundamental concepts: First, that the provision, by the international community, of assistance to both sides in a civil war should have international participation to assure that it is administered for the benefit of the civilian victims of the war. Secondly, that the relief be transported and distributed in ways that convey no military advantage or incur no military liability to either side. Thirdly and finally, that the parties to the conflict refrain from exploiting relief issues for partisan political and propaganda purposes.</p>
                        <p>The United States deplores the severe curtailment of the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross by the Federal Nigerian Government. It does so because it believes that Nigeria, Africa, and the entire world needs a strong and truly impartial organization to carry out the humanitarian mandate of the Geneva Conventions. For these same reasons, this government equally deplores the frequently expressed criticisms and unsubstantiated changes levelled by the Biafran authorities against the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. Such attitudes by both sides to the conflict confirm, in the view of this government, no <pb n="3" xml:id="d81-03" facs="d81-03"/>only the fact of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> impartiality in a difficult situation but also a regrettable lack of understanding by both parties to the conflict of the organizationʼs non-political mandate. It is deplorable that this organization is condemned because it is in fact neutral.</p>
                        <p>The time is not too late to look at new arrangements which will repair the damage that has been done and make possible a new approach to assist effectively women, children, and the aged who are once again threatened with becoming the mass victims of a failure to meet common and decent obligations to assist them. But the essential rethinking to make this possible must come from the parties themselves. The planes stand ready, the vessels are at hand the food is stockpiled, the medicines are available, all within hours of the victims themselves. All that is required is compassion, mutual forebearance and will.</p>
                        <p>As a specific illustration of this point, the U.S. recently provided financing to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> for the chartering of two shallow draft vessels to operate on the Cross River. These vessels are now in Lagos harbor and are ready to move. But the necessary safe conduct assurances have not so far been forthcoming from either the Biafran authorities or the Federal Military Government.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d81-04" facs="d81-04"/>
                        <p>In connection with the above enumerated principles, the United States knows that the Federal Military Government is concerned that night relief flights provide cover for arms flights. We also understand the desire of the Federal Government for an inspection system to satisfy itself of the integrity of cargoes carried over or through its territories. We believe that controlled daylight flights would be both an effective and proper means of divorcing the air relief routes from any taint of military operations. <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> agreement to such procedures should assure the safety of the relief flights and the integrity of the air approaches used by such flights. Under such controls and agreement, there are no reasons which would justify the Biafrans in refusing relief merely because it passes through Federal territory. Satisfactory arrangements for a daytime air-lift can be quickly worked out, and such an air-lift, together with a water route, could meet the supplementary food needs of the civilian population. The United States sees no reason why an internationally operated water route with inspection procedures could not quickly be brought into being under simple conditions that immunize it from military taint. But to make any or all of this possible will, we repeat, require the compassion, the forebearance and the will of both parties.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d81-05" facs="d81-05"/>
                        <p>It is in this spirit that we appeal to both parties to the conflict to pause, to think again and cooperate with their fellowmen in other countries in isolating the task of saving untold thousands of their brothers--and our brothers.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we seek to bring about a resumption of the flow of relief supplies through a four point approach:
<list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>We are urging the Biafran authorities to accept daylight relief flights with assurance of neutral air corridors and with reasonable inspection on Nigerian territory over which all relief flights must pass.</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>We are urging the Federal Military Government to facilitate arrangements for daylight flights under these conditions so that they can begin at the earliest possible time.</item>

                                <item>In order to feed the needy while the day-time airlift is being established on an effective basis we are appealing to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to permit night relief flights to resume for a period of two weeks.</item>
                                <label>d.</label>
                                <item>Lastly, we are appealing to both parties to give their final agreement to arrangements worked out by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>, our Special Relief Coordinator, that will permit the Cross River water route to get under way under the operating control of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. It is this <pb n="6" xml:id="d81-06" facs="d81-06"/>route which may be the most workable for providing large amounts of relief to the enclave under mutually acceptable conditions.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The U.S.--as over the past months--will do all we can to help prevent a repetition of last summerʼs tragedy. But we should be absolutely clear that in the last account, only the parties themselves have the choice of life or death for their people. UNQTE</p>

                            <item>Next Steps in Nigeria-Biafra</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>For your background, the following summarizes where we stand in the wake of the recent Federal decision to take over the relief operation.</p>
                        <p>-- The Red Cross airlift into Biafra, which had been flying from neighboring Dahomey to feed one-two million people, is at an end. The Federals insist on daylight flights with inspection in Federal territory. Yet the Biafrans fear “inspection” means Federal poisoning and, more important, will not risk daylight relief flights becoming a cover for Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s to stage surprise raids. The Red Cross, as a matter of principle in its strict adherence to the Geneva Conventions on sovereignty, will not operate without agreement from both sides.</p>
                        <p>-- There is now no plausible alternative to daylight flights. Neither side will accept the river corridor negotiated by <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>: the Federals because they claim the food will go to rebel troops in that sector, the Biafrans because they fear a military violation of the point where they open their defensive lines to receive and trans-ship the food.</p>
                        <p>-- The Federals are now committed to their own public to try to maintain a military embargo on any night time relief flights. This leaves the other half of the original airlift -- the U.S. and European church agencies flying from the island of Sao Tome -- liable to be shot down by Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. (The irony here is that the Federals charge night relief with being a cover for arms flights. Yet since the night food flights have stopped, arms flights seem to have gone into Biafra as heavily as ever despite increased <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> activity.)</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d82-02" facs="d82-02"/>
                        <p>-- At the present impasse, both sides distrust our good offices on relief. The Biafrans think that <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> is a captive of a pro-Federal State Department. The Federals regard Ferguson as secretly pro-Biafran, concerned only with feeding the rebels while the war drags on. The Biafrans, of course, would like to have our military “guarantee” that an air corridor or river route would not be violated by a surprise Federal attack -- a demand <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> cannot meet under present policy.</p>
                        <p>-- The new Federal relief policy (laced with some bloody-minded talk from Federal politicians about starvation as a “legitimate weapon”) can only appear to the world, and particularly U.S. opinion, as a form of genocide. U.S. acquiescence in the Federal action could appear to our critics at best as insensitive, at worse as complicity.</p>
                        <p>In sum: The hard-liners are in the saddle in Lagos and seem deter-mined to crush a bitter tribal enemy whatever outsiders do or think. The Biafrans are fighting for their lives, and will not put food above what they see as legitimate concerns over their military security. The Red Cross is righteously indignant and will pull out before they compromise their historical neutrality by letting the Federals really take over the relief operation. The church agencies, with grim fervor, are ready to fly relief against Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. With at least half the relief cut off, there is bound to be rising public and Congressional pressure.</p>
                        <p>In my judgement, all this brings us to a basic choice in our posture toward the Nigerian civil war. Our present policy -- limited largely to exhortation of both sides -- seems at the end of its usefulness. The heart of the relief problem is clearly the war itself. So long as the fighting continues, both sides will have reasons to reject relief and more Biafrans will starve.</p>
                        <p>Our policy choice boils down to (i) stay on the present course and realistically accept the futility of exhortation from the sidelines or (ii) make a serious effort to try to stop the fighting as well as resume relief. I have State working urgently with my staff on a paper to lay out our options in detail, and you will have it in the next few days.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d82-03" facs="d82-03"/>
                        <p>Meanwhile, there are several palliative actions which you might take. None will surmount the basic problems of Federal insensitivity or Biafran intransigence. But they would highlight your concern without foreclosing our remaining policy choices.</p>
                        <p>Public and Congressional pressures bear generally on three main questions: (1) What are we doing about the Federal embargo on relief? (2) Why canʼt we take some initiative to break the impasse caused by Biafran insistence that any relief corridor be guaranteed against surprise Federal violation? and (3) Is our relief policy a captive of a pro-Federal bias in our broader policy toward the civil war?</p>
                        <p>There are three broad approaches:</p>
                        <p>(1) Contesting the Federal relief embargo. Here the object would be to demonstrate clearly we are not simply accepting the Federal action, on their own terms, as a routine assertion of sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>--You could write a public letter to the heads of the main relief agencies (International Red Cross and Joint Church Aid) to express your strong continuing support for their humanitarian mission.</p>
                        <p>--At the same time, you would publicly write General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to appeal on humanitarian grounds for a prompt resumption of flights and acceptance of the river corridor. We could offer <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>ʼs good offices to speed workable coordination between the Federal Government and the Red Cross. But the brunt of the message to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> would be that we expect humane statesmanship from Federal Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>-- The White House could release both these letters to the press with an accompanying Presidential statement that we are pursuing all public and private means at our disposal to re-establish relief, that we deplore the Federal action, and that these two letters are examples of our initiatives.</p>
                        <p>(2) How to guarantee relief corridors against military violation.</p>
                        <p>-- Charlie Yost would make a public approach to <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName>, appealing in your name for a United Nations role, on an <pb n="4" xml:id="d82-04" facs="d82-04"/>emergency basis, to supervise (a) the neutrality of day-light flights into Biafra and (b) the point at which food crosses the battleline after coming up the river corridor.</p>
                        <p>-- You might reinforce this approach with a public letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TPE2">Trudeau</persName> (who is pretty much in the same boat with domestic pressures on relief) asking the Canadians to join us in appealing for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p>-- To bring along the Africans (whose pride will be wounded by an <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> approach which implicitly acknowledges the failure of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> in its many efforts to settle Nigerian problems) you could ask <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> during his visit here next week to consider how the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> might play a coordinating role with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in such supervision of relief corridors. This would be publicized after the visit.</p>
                        <p>(3) Separating relief from any appearance of pro-Federal bias. I think the essential in this respect is to show your personal involvement and direction.</p>
                        <p>-- You could call <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> to meet with you and Jean Mayer, whose credentials are impeccable with those pushing for more relief. Ferguson would meet the press afterwards, explaining that his report to you had to remain largely confidential but making clear your urgent and impartial concern. The point would be that <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> was now reporting directly to you rather than State.</p>
                        <p>-- To dramatize U.S. support of relief agencies, you could plan a three-four hour stop in Geneva on the way home from your upcoming trip. The format would be a meeting with the President of the Red Cross and heads of the church agencies. Either you could make a brief address or there could be a joint communique stressing our backing of the humanitarian agencies.</p>
                        <p>-- You could call in the major Congressional figures in the Nigerian question (Senators Brooke, <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>, Goodell, and Pearson; Congressmen Luckens, Lowenstein, Diggs, and Morse) for a White House briefing on our vigorous relief efforts to date. You could then give them a hearing <pb n="5" xml:id="d82-05" facs="d82-05"/>on any ideas how we can expedite relief without the U.S. taking sides or getting embroiled in the civil war.</p>
                        <p>-- At any point, to buttress any of the actions above, we could do a press backgrounder to stress U. S. neutrality, White House direction of policy, and pressures being exerted-on both sides (particularly the Federals) to reach agreement on a relief route.</p>
                        <p>We can reasonably expect dramatic window dressing of this kind to soften the domestic critics for a while. But your greater involvement also raises expectations of tangible progress. This suggests the need for a re-examination of the political aspects now being undertaken. I will have recommendations to you in a few days.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you authorize the three steps outlined above.</p>
                        <p>(1) Contest Federal relief embargo.<lb/>2) Guarantee relief corridors<lb/>(3) Separate relief from appearance of pro-Federal bias.</p>

                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> decided on June 30 to withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> its relief coordinating role in the Federally-controlled area and to impose restrictive conditions on relief shipments into the Biafran enclave which the Biafrans reject. If both sides remain intransigent, the specter of renewed mass starvation arises.</p>
                        <p>2. Great public concern has been expressed. Strong Congressional concern has been manifested and could lead to constraints in our relations with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, including our economic aid program. In the face of this situation we can (a) take further initiatives still open to us under existing policy, or (b) take aʼ decision to change our policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Present Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Our policy to date has been to give large-scale support to international relief efforts through the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and other agencies and to make a sharp distinction between humanitarian assistance and military or direct political involvement. We have avoided the latter, have continued to recognize the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and have considered the political problem as one that can best be solved by the Africans themselves.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d84-02" facs="d84-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Present Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Starvation as an instrument of war has become a major issue. Each side has chosen to subordinate relief to political and military advantage. In imposing its new conditions, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is reflecting the predominant attitudes amongst its own public that what is considered uncontrolled international assistance to the rebellion must be stopped. These conditions were imposed with full knowledge of Biafran opposition to the controls imposed, with full awareness that they could result in a cessation of this flow of relief and with an apparent willingness to accept the international implications. The Biafran leadership, on the other hand, has shown itself only too willing to utilize the suffering of its people to generate foreign support. It appears to be calculating the risk of mass starvation as acceptable at least for some weeks or months in the expectation that foreign intervention will materialize. Relief needs in Federal territory are manageable even in the new situation. The problem facing us continues to be that of getting relief into Biafra. Our support of efforts to do this and the consequent strong pressure on the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to assure a relief flow have very seriously strained our relations with that regime. There are still a few hopeful signs but they are not too encouraging. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, in response to our demarches, has expressed to us its willingness to discuss modalities of daylight flights with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> or any other relief organization wishing to continue the relief airlift, including the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>. (It has also announced its willingness to have neutral participation in <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> inspection procedures.) It has, however refused to reconsider its prohibition of night flights and has in effect rejected the water route for the time being. Elsewhere, there is encouraging evidence that the French may be shifting toward greater interest in the relief, as contrasted with the political, aspects of the problem. Vatican interest continues high.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The present situation has very dangerous implications for the United States. We are already <pb n="3" xml:id="d84-03" facs="d84-03"/>at a threshold in our relations with Nigeria which opens the serious question of whether further pressures on them in a direction they regard as adverse to their interests in any matter, will not seriously damage our already strained relations. Against the background of continuing U.S. Congressional and popular interest and frustration, past events have already pushed us a long way towards assuming primary responsibility for relief. The current impasse and our doubtful ability to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the relief problem increasingly exposes us to additional pressures to assume primary responsibility for ending the conflict. This will be an even more intractable problem than relief. At this juncture, we see little prospect of success in the political realm given the present irreconcilable attitudes of the two sides, African opinion, and current British, French and Soviet policies. A summary of peace efforts to date is attached (Tab H).</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Further Implementation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. In furtherance of our primary objectives of (a) assuring an internationally recognized sponsor for a daytime airlift and a water route into Biafra, and</p>
                        <p>(b) bringing about resumption of relief shipments into the enclave, we have taken some actions and contemplate others which, given the attitudes of the parties, may be little more than palliatives. However there are areas worthy of more exploration such as the modalities of daylight flights originating in Federal territory.</p>
                        <p>7. We have: (a) made representations to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and to the Biafrans (Tab B) on the four point action program set forth in the Secretaryʼs July 2 statement (Tab A); coordinated approaches with the British (Tab C); suggested discussions with the Emperor (Tab ll); communicated with the United Nations Secretary General (Tab E), the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> (Tab F), and the Vatican (Tab G); and we are planning to send Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> to Geneva, Paris, London and the Vatican.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d84-04" facs="d84-04"/>
                        <p>We Contemplate</p>
                        <p>8. (a) Your talking with the Emperor or the Ethiopian Foreign Minister on Tuesday or Wednesday; (b) possible Three Power talks (U.S., <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, France), depending on the results of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs mission; (c) continued efforts to induce the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and the Biafrans to agree to resume relief shipments; (d) continuing encouragement to both the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and the Federal Government to work out a new relationship; and (e) urging the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> to publicize the resumption of discussions between them about modalities for daylight flights and any other relief efforts that may materialize.</p>
                        <p>We Might Consider</p>
                        <p>9. (a) Bilateral exchanges on the relief problem with other interested countries, such as Canada, the Scandinavian countries, West Germany and Italy; (b) bilateral talks with African countries which have expressed interest in resolving this problem including those which have recognized Biafra; and (c) discussions with the Commonwealth Secretariat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Possible Actions with Regard to Congress</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. A more intensive effort could be made to mobilize Congressional opinion behind present policy, building on (a) those elements favoring the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> position, (b) those who tend to oppose direct U.S. involvement in uncertain situations abroad, and (c) those who are generally uninformed on the issues and their implications for the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Possible Actions in the Public Domain</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. Public knowledge of the steps we have taken, consistent with the effective security of delicate negotiations, and evidence of our intention to continue <pb n="5" xml:id="d84-05" facs="d84-05"/>to grapple with the problem are of equal importance. Any or all of the following steps could be taken in an effort to make it clear to the Congress and interested citizens that there is still a possibility of renewed relief shipments and that, in any event, delicate negotiations to that end are in progress. (a) Action by the President to emphasize his concern with the problem that could take the form of (1) a visit to Geneva for discussions with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> President and the Voluntary Agencies on his way home from Romania; or (2) public messages to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, the heads of state of other concerned nations, or even to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and 0jukwu; (b) issuance of a White Paper on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs efforts, although this would probably make any further progress in breaking the impasse on his part impossible; (c) a public reply by the Secretary to any of the numerous communications he has received from interested groups, particularly <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>; (d) appearance of one or more highly placed Departmental officials on TV at an appropriate time for a public explanation of United States policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Change in Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. If the relief impasse continues, we face three stark choices:</p>
                        <p>(a) Disengagement. This will only be possible if a clear, acceptable and credible statement can be made to the effect that the United States has exhausted all current possibilities short of the use of force. In the present climate of opinion, disengagement will be possible only if both sides or the Biafrans alone can clearly be shown to be at fault.</p>
                        <p>(b) Resumption of relief shipments into Biafra in defiance of either the Nigerians or the Biafrans or both. Possibilities open to us for relief actions to be undertaken without the consent of either or both parties are extremely limited and fraught with grave risk. Such actions might include an attempt to initiate a relief airdrop from <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> territory over Biafran objections or <pb n="6" xml:id="d84-06" facs="d84-06"/>militarily escorted relief flights into Biafra over <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> objections. The latter action would, of course, involve direct violation of Nigerian sovereignty with serious consequences for our relations not only with Nigeria but with the rest of Africa.</p>
                        <p>(c) Political Involvement. We should be clear about the risks. To the extent that U.S. political involvement seemed to run counter to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> interests and stated <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> positions, we run the risks of alienating the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, placing strains on our relations with the rest of Africa, undermining the British, and enhancing the posture of the Soviet Union, which could emerge as the principle ally of Nigeria. We would also endanger the safety of the 5,000 or more American citizens resident in Nigeria, to say nothing of an American investment in excess of $200 million. Ironically, having incurred these great disadvantages, the relief effort would have been endangered rather than helped. Political-courses of action proposed by interested parties have included calls for an arms embargo, engaging the United Nations, and convening of a great power conference to consider the question. While these dramatic solutions seem attractive, we strongly doubt that they are within our power to bring about. To be effective an arms embargo has to be adhered to by all and impartially policed. We do not believe that those supplying the two sides will agree and, in any event, arms are readily available on the international market. To date the United Nations has been unresponsive to efforts to involve it in the Nigerian question. The Secretary General has accepted the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> decision that it is an internal Nigerian affair and has been unwilling to go beyond sending a personal representative as an observer to Lagos who works parallel with the international observer team. However, he now seems prepared to accept a broader role for UNICEF. Consultations with key member states, and the Secretary General, have made it very clear that the prospects for inscription of Nigerian relief or the Nigerian civil war has, at least to date, had no <pb n="7" xml:id="d84-07" facs="d84-07"/>prospect of success. As for a great power conference such as that convened on the Arab-Israeli problem, we see no evidence that the Soviets would engage in a useful exchange to that end.</p>

                        <p>1. Following text of classified report dated July 7 on Biafra food situation should supply background material requested <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>. We consider this report excellent summary current situation. BEGIN TEXT: 1) Since 10 June 1969 night air deliveries of relief food to Biafra by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Joint Church Aid have virtually ceased as the result of air attacks by the Federal Military Government. Information on Biafraʼs food supply is scanty, but because domestic food production probably will supply the populationʼs caloric needs it seems unlikely that the predicted wave of mass deaths will occur during the next 2-3 weeks. Beyond this we are uncertain because useful data on the critical protein supply is almost wholly lacking and it was a protein shortage that led to large scale dying in the fall of 1968 especially <pb n="2" xml:id="d85-02" facs="d85-02"/>among young children and the aged.</p>
                        <p>2) In the three-months before relief flights were suspended in early June, the emergency food programs was decisive in preventing widespread starvation in Biafran controlled areas. This was the normal hungry season--March through June--when domestic food supplies normally fall off sharply. The relief agencies during the period reportedly were providing food to an estimated 1.5 million persons daily and average food relief shipments were running at least 175 tons per day. These shipments probably accounted for some one-fourth to one-third of the caloric intake of those being fed and a much higher proportion of the protein intake. Many of these persons otherwise undoubtedly would have suffered even greater nutritional deficiencies and many would have died.</p>
                        <p>3) The lack of protein-rich foods remains the critical element in the Biafran food situation. Before the war the area now <pb n="3" xml:id="d85-03" facs="d85-03"/>comprising Biafra was nearly self-sufficient in total calories. However, some 80 percent of protein requirements came from other regions of Nigeria and from foreign imports. Protein deficiency and malnutrition, especially among children, were common in eastern Nigeria, and malnutrition bordering on starvation frequently occurred during the traditional hungry season--the pre-harvest months which end in July. Food relief shipments--high-protein dietary supplements including stockfish, dried beans, rice, corn, salt, CSM (corn-soybean mixture), and milk--by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have helped minimize malnutrition in the past 6 months and death by starvation has declined far below the levels of September, October, and November 1968. Protein deficiency, however, is still widespread.</p>
                        <p>4) This yearʼs harvest will almost certainly be the best since the outbreak of war. Planting for this harvest was carried out after the last influx of refugees and the mass starvation in the fall of 1968. The Ibos, well-known for their <pb n="4" xml:id="d85-04" facs="d85-04"/>ingenuity, experience, and skills, reportedly responded vigorously to this critical situation. For example, a “land army” campaign was launched to increase the area under maize, cassava, yams, and cocoyams (the leaves of which are rich in protein) and the population was exhorted to plant every available foot of ground in food crops.</p>
                        <p>5) The food supply should be adequate in terms of caloric content even without relief shipments, at least through the end of the summer. The fresh (undried) maize harvest started in May with the beginning of the rainy season; the harvesting of peanuts (a protein food) began in June and will continue during July; and the harvest of dried maize and early planted yams begins in early July. The main yam harvest starts in early August and continues until November. Cassava planted in December and later can be harvested in July and during the following months.</p>
                        <p>6) With the cessation of relief flights the shortage of <pb n="5" xml:id="d85-05" facs="d85-05"/>protein foods will become acute. Although the per capita availability of indigenous foods is expected to reach normal pre-war levels during the harvest months beginning about now, the lack of imported protein foods will increase malnutrition and kwashiorkor particularly among the children, the sick and the aged. The death rate in these groups is certain to increase and probably markedly.<lb/>END TEXT.<lb/>END</p>

                        <p>“Americans for Biafran Relief” is a broad-based bipartisan group with members ranging from Lukens and Fulton Lewis III to Congressmen Edward Koch and Richard Ottinger. They placed a full-page ad in the July 10th issue of the New York Times, the essence of which appears below:</p>
                        <p>The Biafra war has claimed more children than soldiers. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is already trying to end one war.

                        <p>2. In delivering letter you should convey following to him.</p>
                        <p>3. USG deeply disturbed at posture taken toward US in last few weeks including strident statements made by high-ranking officials of what we regard as friendly government. We have been particularly surprised that <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has apparently been uninterested in correcting irresponsible statements, such as those on Cross River project, serving to incite public opinion against US.</p>
                        <p>4. We want to make clear again that our policy toward Nigeria is one of friendship not hostility. As the President said in his earlier letter to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, we want to continue our friendly cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. We have, after all, common interests and basic ties of friendship. In present situation our concern is to help Nigeria to prevent other Nigerians from dying, not to intervene in the war. Our policy toward Nigeria has been honest and straightforward. Accusations to the contrary impugn our good faith.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d87-02" facs="d87-02"/>
                        <p>5. We expect of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> a responsible and dispassionate appreciation of our position just as USG appreciates that of Nigeria. This mutual understanding is the only possible basis for the constructive and friendly relationship we want with Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>6. We appreciate the role of Nigerian public opinion in <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> consideration of relief arrangements.<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> must realize, however, that should the relief impasse continue much longer the question of possible new USG approaches to the problem will undoubtedly arise. We believe <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has much to gain in terms of the understanding and support of the international community by being as forthcoming and magnanimous on relief arrangements as its real security requirements make possible.</p>

                        <p>1. Following is text of letter from President to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> for immediate delivery:</p>
                        <p>“Dear General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“ As I wrote you in our earlier exchange of letters, the United Statesʼ long friendship with Nigeria has led quite naturally to our deep concern over the suffering in the civil war. We feel Nigeriaʼs agony all the more as the fighting enters its third year.</p>
                        <p>“Since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs appointment as Special Relief Coordinator on February 22, we have been following closely the progress of his efforts to expand the flow of relief to suffering civilians. We were greatly encouraged when your government took the important step forward of agreeing in principle to supplement the relief airlift with the opening of a surface corridor utilizing the Cross River.</p>
                        <p>“It is precisely because of this earlier hopeful progress that we have viewed with such gravity the relief impasse following upon recent decisions of the Federal Military Government. I can readily <pb n="2" xml:id="d88-02" facs="d88-02"/>appreciate your own concerns lest international relief efforts be exploited as partisan intervention in the civil war. The relief agencies obviously must observe the requirements of Nigerian security just as they acknowledge conditions imposed in the name of Biafran security. It is of evident importance that the agencies negotiate in earnest with your Government on this issue to reach an equitable and constructive agreement.</p>
                        <p>“Legitimate concerns allow -- and the enormity of the human tragedy demands -- humane statesmanship by all parties. Whatever the passions of the moment or rightness of the cause, history has judged harshly any governmentʼs heedless acceptance of suffering.</p>
                        <p>“Obviously the secessionist authorities have an obligation to forego political maneuvering to succor the starving under their control, and I hope indeed that President Houphouet-Boigny to whom I am writing about this same problem can impress this upon them. At the same time, the attitudes and actions of you and your Government with respect to saving the lives of those you regard, not as enemies, but as countrymen cannot fail to have a profound impact on the international community and on your future relationships in that <pb n="3" xml:id="d88-03" facs="d88-03"/>community. Humanitarian treatment of non-combatants in civil strife -- wherever they find themselves in a divided land -- is surely the way, as you yourself have pointed out, to the reconciliation you seek for your country.</p>
                        <p>“I urge you, then, to agree with the Red Cross and religious voluntary agencies to an immediate resumption of the relief airlift and implementation of the Cross River relief corridor.</p>
                        <p>“The traditional friendship between our two peoples is indeed being tested by these complicated questions of relief and civil war. There are those who say that the United States does not understand Nigeriaʼs agony. I believe we do understand, and that our interests, as your own, are best served by the peaceful development of Nigeriaʼs great potential. But we can meet this test and serve our mutual goals only working together toward our common interest in saving innocent lives. I earnestly hope that this cooperation will surmount the forces of fear and suspicion until, as we all pray, your country is once again at peace.</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I am well aware of your deep humanitarian concern over the effects of the civil war in Nigeria. As a friend of Africa, the United States also deplores this tragedy, particularly the suffering of innocent civilians.</p>
                        <p>“The present interruption of the international relief effort, if it continues, could bring about catastrophe. I am addressing urgent appeals to the International Committee of the Red Cross, Joint Church Aid and the Federal Military Government to exercise the utmost flexibility and cooperation in agreeing to a prompt resumption of the <pb n="2" xml:id="d89-02" facs="d89-02"/>relief airlift into Biafra and the realization of the Cross River corridor. The United States is also taking other steps to encourage the immediate activation of these relief routes with reasonable safe-guards to meet the security concerns expressed by both Federal Nigeria and Biafra.</p>
                        <p>“I appeal to you, Mr. President, to use your great stature and special position to encourage the Biafran authorities to show the same statesmanship we have urged so strongly upon Federal Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>“My letter to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> observed that history would judge harshly any Governmentʼs heedless acceptance of suffering in this conflict. That verdict would fall most heavily, however, on the Biafran authorities should they sacrifice, for military or political advantage, the very people whose survival they claim to be their goal.</p>
                        <p>“In a spirit of mutual humanitarian concern, I hope you will convey this appeal to General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> along with your own strong support for an equitable and immediate elimination of the obstacles to an effective relief program.</p>

                        <p>PARIS FOR AMB <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">FERGUSON</persName> (NOTIFY AT HOTEL CRILLON)</p>
                        <p>THE FOLLOWING IS A MARKPRESS RELEASE DATED OWERRI, JULY 23. QUOTE: TITLE: OPEN LETTER FROM THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT TO PROFESSOR C. CLYDE FERGUSON WITH REFERENCE TO STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">WILLIAM ROGERS</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOTED WITH APPRECIATION THE CONTINUING INTEREST SHOWED BY THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ON THE QUESTION OF PROVIDING RELIEF TO ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERINGS OF BIAFRAN VICTIMS OF NIGERIAʼS WAR OF GENOCIDE AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE RECENT STATEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">WILLIAM ROGERS</persName>, ON THE SUBJECT.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO INDICATE ITS COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS ENUNCIATED IN SECRETARY OF STATE, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">WILLIAM ROGERS</persName>ʼ STATEMENT:”</p>
                        <p>“FIRST, THAT THE PROVISION BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON ASSISTANCE TO BOTH SIDES IN A WAR SHOULD HAVE INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION TO ASSURE THAT IT IS ADMINISTERED FOR THE <pb n="2" xml:id="d91-02" facs="d91-02"/>BENEFIT OF THE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF THE WAR.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, THAT THE RELIEF BE TRANSPORTED AND DISTRIBUTED IN WAYS THAT CONVEY NO MILITARY ADVANTAGE OR INCUR NO MILITARY LIABILITY TO EITHER SIDE.</p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, THAT THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT REFRAIN FROM EXPLOITING RELIEF ISSUES FOR PARTISAN, POLITICAL AND PROPAGANDA PURPOSES.</p>
                        <p>“THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO REAFFIRM ITS ACCEPTANCE IN PRINCIPILE TO DAY/NIGHT RELIEF FLIGHTS WITH DAYLIGHT OPERATIONS TO ULI AIRPORT COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY. EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL OR OTHER THIRD PARTY GUARANTEES HAVE ALSO BEEN AGREED. THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WISHES TO REAFFIRM ITS CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE IN PRINCIPLE OF THE SURFACE ROUTE (CROSS RIVER) PROPOSED BY PROFESSOR <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">FERGUSON</persName> IN MARCH AND ACCEPTED BY THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT ON THAT OCCASION.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO RECALL THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO BIAFRA LAST MARCH, IT WAS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED BY PROFESSOR <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">FERGUSON</persName> ON BEHALF OF THE US GOVERNMENT THAT NEITHER LAGOS NOR ANY NIGERIAN HELD AIRPORT SHOULD BE USED AS STAGING POST FOR BRINGING RELIEF BY AIR. CALABAR AND LAGOS WERE ALSO RULED OUT FOR THE SURFACE ROUTE OPERATIONS AS AGREEMENT WAS REACHED TO USE COTONOU OR A SHIP ANCHORED IN MID-OCEAN FROM WHICH RELIEF COULD BE TRANSPORTED BY BARGES OR HELICOPTER.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO LET NIGERIAN REPRESENTATIVES INSPECT THE RELIEF MATERIAL AT STAGING POSTS OUTSIDE NIGERIA, SUCH AS COTONOU AND SANTA ISABEL SO AS TO ASSURE THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE GENUINE BIAFRA STILL STAND BY THIS. THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION, THEREFORE, OF BIAFRA ACCEPTING RELIEF COMING FROM OR TOUCHING DOWN ON ANY NIGERIAN HELD TERRITORY. THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT EXPECTS FOR THAT, IN FAIRNESS, BIAFRAN REPRESENTATIVES WILL HAVE THE SAME RIGHT, TO INSPECT RELIEF GOING INTO NIGERIA.</p>
                        <p>IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE SHORTEST AND MOST ECONOMICAL ROUTE FOR RELIEF TO COME DIRECT INTO BIAFRA FROM THESE NEUTRAL STAGING POSTS. TO CHANNEL OR DIVERT THEM TO NIGERIA WOULD BE TO OFFER THEM POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADVANTAGES WHICH IS IN CONFLICT WITH <pb n="3" xml:id="d91-03" facs="d91-03"/>TWO THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS ENUNCIATED BY SECRETARY OF STATE, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">WILLIAM ROGERS</persName>, AND ACCEPTED BY THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT AS INDICATED ABOVE. ON THIS SCORE, THE FIRST PROPOSAL IN SECRETARY OF STATE, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">WILLIAM ROGERS</persName>ʼ SUBSEQUENT FOUR-POINT APPROACH FOR A NIGERIAN STAGING BASE FAILS TO MEET THE TEST OF NEUTRALITY AND EARLIER UNDERTAKING THAT RELIEF SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CONFER MILITARY/POLITICAL ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE TO EITHER SIDE.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, REMAIN GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE EFFORTS MADE BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE US ADMINISTRATION IN THIS REGARD AND IS WILLING, AS BEFORE, TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS TO FACILITATE INCREASED RELIEF SUPPLIES. UNQUOTE. DECON ON RECEIPT.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName>, reporting on his recent trip to Nigeria and Biafra, said that his vantage point was “non-political.” He explained his involvement in past years in various humanitarian efforts. He had become interested in the kwashiorkor victims in Biafra and decided to see what he could do to help. He presented his idea to Mr. Onyegbula, Permanent Secretary of Biafran Ministry of External Affairs, when the latter was in New York. Starting in December 1968 he began to recruit doctors to send into the Biafran area to treat the stricken children. The Biafrans supplied supporting personnel. The big problem was getting medical supplies into the area. He calls his project “Aid to Biafran Children (ABC).”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> had spoken to him of his determination to conduct the war in a manner which would permit post-war reconciliation with the Ibos. The General referred to a recent speech he had given before a university audience in which he had emphasized that the war was not being fought against enemies. He showed his orders to the Army commanders in which he stated the precepts for the conduct of troops in the field vis-a-vis the rebel soldiers and the civilian population. He also showed a letter he had written to <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> proposing what he called talks without pre-conditions and the reply thereto in which the General averred that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> had insisted that certain facts would have to be taken into account in any talks that might take place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> felt in reading General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs letter that, while the General contended that it involved no pre-conditions, in fact the context of one or more of the paragraphs included certain conditions for talks. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> had asked him, he said, to transmit to <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> his desire for a peace with honor and justice and had asked that he return and report <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs reaction.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d92-02" facs="d92-02"/>
                        <p>From Libreville Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> flew into Uli Airstrip. In reply to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, he said he believes the largest part of the shipments from Libreville are relief supplies. He said that <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> attempts to interdict Uli are a bit farcical, neither scientific nor military. The runway could easily be destroyed, but the bombs from <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> planes had all fallen wide. He also had the impression that Biafra has vastly improved its military position and that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> capture of Urnuahia was more than offset by the Biafran reoccupation of Owerri. US public lacked understanding of this because of the absence of newspaper people on the scene and the printing of biased stories. Biafrans were having more success in their military operations and were able to obtain the major part of their arms supplies by sucking in and encircling Federal units whose arms and equipment then fell into Biafran hands. The Biafrans have a highly organized guerrilla organization, including a number of people who participate part time. The city of Umuahia may be retaken by the Biafrans and one third of it was being contested at the time <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> was there. He spoke of the widespread mining of the highways by the Biafran military and did not see how the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could win and hold the area against the existing Biafran military organization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said that the people in the cities seemed better off than he had anticipated. Outside the cities, however, the population seemed to be suffering from severe malnutrition. He said that the Land Army in Biafra was producing sufficient food but it was mostly of poor nutritional quality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said that he had to travel a long way from Owerri to see 0jukwu, who seemed tired but calm. He was deeply impressed with <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs “exquisite command of the English language” and knew of no one since Nehru who had such command. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> made the same sort of statements as <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> about possible negotiations to end the war, i. e., no pre-conditions and that war is a great tragedy for all concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> feels that there are contradictions in the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and Biafran positions. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> fears Ibo domination and yet, the war allegedly is being fought to ensure that the Ibos are included in the Nigeria of the future. The Biafrans insist on their right to independence and yet they talk about freedom of movement within Nigeria. Words such as secession have become barriers to communications to the warring sides. There is a need to get the two sides talking about real grievances and problems, such as security and the re-integration of the Ibos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> felt that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is willing to meet with Gowoa, but is afraid to propose it for fear it would be taken as weakness. He also would be willing to enter into meetings at lower levels but wants to be sure that these are not used for propaganda or as a cover for military advantage. <pb n="3" xml:id="d92-03" facs="d92-03"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> cannot carry through without the British and the Northerners behind him. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> feels that it is up to the United States to bring pressure to bear to get talks going. He had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> that he write a letter to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> with regard to a United States initiative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> indicated such a letter had been prepared.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said he asked <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> whether he had accepted the Cross River proposal. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> replied affirmatively. He then asked <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> whether he had changed his mind and withdrawn. To this <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> replied he thought there had been a misunderstanding and that there had been a premature announcement of the plan. He said he was prepared to accept the Cross River proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> reiterated this is the time to try to get both sides to enter into talks because of the balanced or stalemate situation. This would have to be done secretly since publicity would cause both sides to denounce the talks. Biafra is neither too strong nor too weak. It is able to defend itself but not able to pursue an advantage. Nigeria is paying a fearsome cost for the war and the war is imperiling the countryʼs future. Both <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> are men of reason who understand the facts of their situation and the implications. The United States could influence 0jukwu.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> referred to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> preference for talks within an Africa context and asked what role the Emperor of Ethiopia might play, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said he thought the Emperor may have expended such credit as he had with the Biafrans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> referred to <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs statements to <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is the key to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> willingness to negotiate and asked whether <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> thought the Biafrans were in a similar position vis-a-vis Houphouet-Boigny and the French. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said he had no valid opinion in this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is the more capable and intelligent of the two leaders and feels there is more solid backing for <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> in Biafra than for <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> in Nigeria. In this regard Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM3">Melbourne</persName> spoke of the coalition structure of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> as contrasted with the Biafran situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> said in reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs question that he had returned to Lagos with the hope of seeing General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> after his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>. Unfortunately he was not able to do so, but he made his report nevertheless through Chief Justice Ademola.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said there was a time, a month or so ago, when it was felt the situation was not amenable to negotiations. Neither side seemed ready to admit its military aim could not be obtained. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName>ʼ comments would indicate that there may have been a change. He thus asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> for his assessment of the attitude of other Biafrans toward an attempt by <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> to move toward talks. What would be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName>ʼ evaluation of the total Biafran response to such a change? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> did not reply directly. He believes the situation is ready to be tested and suggested the sequence should be first to pin down one side and then the other.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d92-04" facs="d92-04"/>
                        <p>In this respect he suggested the President reply to <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs letter (referred to above) as one step in this direction. With respect to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, he suggested that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assess <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> readiness to move towards talks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM3">Melbourne</persName> briefly mentioned earlier attempts to induce negotiations and the breakdown of all these attempts over conditions and caveats laid down by one side or the other.</p>
                        <p>The conversation closed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs question whether anyone amongst the Biafran leaders enjoys the special confidence of <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>. After a discussion of several possibilities, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> felt that, if anyone enjoys the special confidence of <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, it is Mr. Onyegbula.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Although he did not raise the matter in his talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, in an earlier meeting this date with representatives of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>/CF, <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>/P,<gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>/CW and <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>/W, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> proposed transferring the idle <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> C-97ʼs to the French Red Cross. He said Colonel Merle, French Officer in Charge of the Libreville airlift, had agreed to carry ABC medical supplies into Biafra and he argued this is the only transit point which is not already clogged. The Department representatives told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> this would be almost impossible since the French Red Cross had held aloof from the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and Colonel Merleʼs airlift was a pretty shadowy operation involving arms supply as well as relief.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Following for your background in Paris should French raise Biafra.</p>
                        <p>1. Militarily, no major changes though Biafrans aggressive on most fronts. French arms flow to Biafra continues unabated.</p>
                        <p>2. Diplomatically, both sides sent reps to Kampala in response Popeʼs offer to mediate during his trip there, but no current prospect of serious talks. Other initiative we supporting with <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> -- Ethiopian probe of Fed position while Papal-directed black bishop probes Biafrans -- stalled pending Popeʼs personal effort at Kampala. No other diplomatic efforts apparent.</p>
                        <p>3. Most relief still blocked by failure of two sides and Red Cross to agree on conditions daylight flights. Feds still outlaw night flights, though church agencies flying in about 100 tons nightly against continuing inept efforts by Fed <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s to interdict. Starvation slowly rising but church flights forestall mass impact.</p>
                        <p>4. Following up Presidentʼs letters, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> now has two sides together secretly in Geneva (French helped get Biafrans) to talk river relief corridor. Chances slim Feds will agree, but some give <pb n="2" xml:id="d93-02" facs="d93-02"/>on Biafran side and discussions still alive on technical details if not central political obstacle.</p>
                        <p>5. Following were main French points in latest exchange on subject (<persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SRSJ1">Shriver</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName>, July 23):</p>
                        <p>a. French policy quote excludes unquote recognition Biafra. Yet best way achieve negotiated reunification is more even-handed US posture toward Biafrans. This would assuage Biafran fears in negotiating tribal security within unified Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>b. French would oppose US mediation role until we less tied to Lagos. Otherwise, four-power talks would be three-to-one against Biafra and relief negotiations have US and Feds conspiring to quote trap unquote Biafra.</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> believes US, rather than Ethiopians, ultimately behind black bishop probe. Probably suspects we have some other initiative in works which we not disclosing.</p>
                        <p>d. <persName corresp="#p_SRSJ1">Shriver</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> judge <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> generally uneasy about his present policy because French have concluded Biafra cannot win independence, and therefore, new French government could be willing support a US effort at political settlement.</p>
                        <p>6. In light foregoing, I see no reason for you to raise Biafra with French at this juncture. Recommend you make two main points in response if they query:</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d93-03" facs="d93-03"/>
                        <p>A. US working hard to get fair agreement both sides to resume relief via Red Cross airlift and river corridor. We hope for continuing French support these efforts.</p>
                        <p>B. US closing no doors in considering future steps Nigeria-Biafra. We want to stay in close touch with French on whole range problems, political as well as relief.</p>

Because of references in <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> note to its flight bases in Cotonou and Santa Isabel and omission of any reference to touchdowns within Nigeria, it particularly important that <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> not act hastily or negatively or make public statements which would limit its flexibility.</p>

                        <p>1. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED IN PARA 3 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>, I CALLED ON UKHICOMER AND PROPOSED THAT HE MIGHT WISH RAISE SUBJECT WITH <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> ALONG LINES PARA 1 AND 2 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>. BEFORE REPLYING HE ASKED ME TO READ THE FOLLOWING TELEGRAM RE <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> NOTE WHICH HE HAD SENT YESTERDAY EVENING: BEGIN TEXT: THIS DRAFT IS EVEN WORSE THAN I EXPECTED. IT MAKES NO CONCESSIONS TO THE FEDERAL POSITION AND IGNORES EVERYTHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN LAGOS. IT APPEARS IN A SENSE TO BE A TRAP FOR THE FEDERAL GOVT, WHO COULD SCARCELY ACCEPT IT AS IT STANDS WITHOUT DETAILED CLARIFICATION OF ITS AMBIGUITIES, WHEREAS <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName> COULD NO DOUBT ACCEPT IT IN PRINCIPLE. IN ANY CASE THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF PERSUADING THE FEDERALS TO MAKE CONCESSIONS UNLESS THE <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ASCERTAIN <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName>ʼS OFFICIAL REACTIONS TO THE ARRANGEMENTS DISCUSSED IN LAGOS. IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR NAVILLE OR SOME SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE TO COME OUT TO LAGOS FOR THIS PURPOSE. 2. BIGNAMI, WHO HAS BEEN SHOWN THE DRAFT, ENTIRELY AGREES THAT TO HANDLE THE MATTER IN THE WAY PROPOSED WOULD BE A MAJOR BLUNDER LIKELY GREATLY TO REDUCE <pb n="2" xml:id="d96-02" facs="d96-02"/>CHANCES OF A REASONABLE COMPROMISE AND INTENDS TO FLY TO GENEVA TO SAY SO. END TEXT.</p>
                        <p>2. HICOME SAID HE FAILED SEE WHAT THERE WAS ABOUT THE <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> NOTE WHICH HE COULD COMMEND TO GOWON SINCE IT IGNORES THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> AND <persName corresp="#p_NMA1">NAVILLE</persName>, IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO FEDERAL CONDITIONS, “IGNORES ARTICLES 22 AND 23 OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION.” HE THEN STATED THAT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> HAD ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE NOTE AND THAT HE WOULD NOT RPT NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE THIS SUBJECT WITH <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> UNLESS HE RECEIVED DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS TO DO SO FROM LONDON. HE THEN COMMENTED THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS BE WILLING TO PUSH FOR ACCEPTANCE OF A “PROPERLY PRESENTED” PLAN FOR INSPECTION OUTSIDE NIGERIA BUT THAT IN THIS INSTANCE HE REGARDED THE MANNER OF PRESENTATION AS “LAMENTABLE” AND COMMENTED WAS REMINISCENT OF LINDTʼS FATAL MISTAKES OF PRESENTING THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> WITH A FAIT DʼACCOMPLIS.</p>
                        <p>3.

                        <p>1. While we disappointed that UKHicomer considers <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> note so negative from standpoint <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> interests, we still believe, as stated in opening paragraphs of refs a and b, that it could provide framework to which addition of details could serve interests of both sides.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly,Embassy Lagos is requested to arrange appointment with <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> at earliest opportunity, even though text of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> note may not have reached Lagos. In course of discussion with <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>, you should not take position as advocate of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> proposal and should specifically state that US had no hand in its formulation. However, it is consonant with our policy, of which <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> should be well aware, to be friendly counselor <pb n="2" xml:id="d97-02" facs="d97-02"/>against hasty negative action before cool and searching <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> study of possibilities inherent in <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> note.</p>
                        <p>2. In addition to your earlier instructions (ref a) you should point out to Arikpo aspects of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> note which in our view represent concessions to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> views. These include:</p>
                        <p>a) Daylight flights.<lb/>b) Flights under certain <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> controls, such as prescribed routes, prior notification, and monitoring.<lb/>c) Right to request observers to accompany flights.<lb/>d) Undoubtedly some form of <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> participation in inspection.</p>
                        <p>3. If questioned, you can state that text of note does not appear exclude touchdown on <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> territory. However, we know touchdown of fully loaded plane presents serious problem of maintenance of aircraft. Perhaps some other form of symbolic touchdown could be elaborated with <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: We understand <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> proposals were discussed by <persName corresp="#p_FJ2">Freymond</persName> with COOKEY and Obi in Geneva and that they rejected them, indicating they acting officially and with authorization (would appreciate Geneva confirming, and expanding if possible). END <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>

                        <p>5. a. As stated para 5, ref b, Dept. does not repeat not consider that note ignores article 23. Term “technical arrangements” is itself uncertain in meaning. It does not necessarily apply all aspects any given relief operation, but might be interpreted mean technical aspects actual operation, e.g., identification codes, air corridor (height, latitude, longitude), hours of operation. Inspection is not necessarily a “technical arrangement.” In absence interpretation based on convention documentation, convention appears unclear and subject varying interpretations.</p>
                        <p>b. Article 22 offers little help in present situation since it refers only to classic medical relief role of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>“Aircraft exclusively employed for the removal of wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and maternity cases, or for the transport of medical personnel and equipment, shall not be attacked, but shall be respected while flying at heights, times and on routes specifically agreed upon between all the parties to the conflict concerned.”</p>

                        <p>6. FOR LONDON: In light UKHicomer Lagos strongly negative report, it unlikely <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UKG</gloss> would issue instructions to him along lines State 129202, Para 3. However, Embassy should discuss foregoing with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> and emphasize need for statesmanlike <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> response to <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>note.

SEVERAL TIMES <persName corresp="#p_FJ2">FREYMOND</persName>/ <persName corresp="#p_NMA1">NAVILLE</persName> OPINED THAT ORDINARY MAN IN SWITZERLAND AND ELSEWHERE DOES NOT AND DOES NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND LEGALISTIC POSITIONS
- WANTS RESULTS - MUST FEED STARVING. BOTH INDICATED THAT ONCE <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> TOOK ON NEW FUNCTION OF RELIEF IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN BACK. (C) NO ONE IN COMMITTEE EXPECTS <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> NOTE TO PRODUCE WITH FMG. APPARENTLY, ENTIRE COMMITTEE AT THURSDAY MEETING CONVINCED <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> RESPONSIBLE FOR CURRENT IMPASSE. THIS ATTITUDE MAY BE RESULT OF SPADEWORK DONE BY LINOT AND <persName corresp="#p_FJ2">FREYMOND</persName> PRIOR TO COMMITTEE MEETING.</p>

WE REGARD IT FORTUNATE TONE <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> LETTER RELATIVELY MILD GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES AND BELIEVE OUR AND UKHC INTERVENTION DID HAVE SOME EFFECT.</p>
                        <p>2.

WE HOPE THEY WILL CHOOSE TO REGARD <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName>ʼS RELATIVELY RESTRAINED REACTION TO <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> NOTE AS EVIDENCE THAT <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> HAS NOT WRITTEN OFF POSSIBILITY <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> FINDING SOLUTION PERMITTING DAYLIGHT FLIGHTS, AND THAT <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> CONSIDER DESIRABILITY NEW PERSONAL MISSION TO LAGOS. BELIEVE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO STRESS THAT DESPITE BRICKBATS FROM BOTH SIDES, <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> HAS AND CONTINUE TO PERFORM INVALUABLE RELIEF ROLE AS ONLY NEUTRAL ORGANIZATION MANDATED WITH THIS FUNCTION. IF <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> WITHDRAWS, WE KNOW OF NO OTHER ORGANIZATION MORE <pb n="2" xml:id="d99-02" facs="d99-02"/>POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES TO PERFORM VITAL RELIEF ROLE IN ENCLAVE AND CANNOT ENVISION ACCEPTANCE BY <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> OF <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> OR FRENCH RED CROSS RELIEF FLIGHTS, EITHER EXPLICIT OR TACIT.

                        <p>3. LETTER, IN SHORT, SHOULD NOT REPEAT NOT BE TAKEN AS ABSOLUTE REJECTION. IT RAISES LOGICAL QUESTIONS WITH <persName corresp="#p_NMA1">NAVILLE</persName>.

HOW DOES <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> POLICY CONTRAVENE GENEVA CONVENTION?

                        <p>4. BELIEVE BEST APPROACH <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> IF THEY DESIRE STAY IN NIGERIAN RELIEF BUSINESS - WHICH SEEM IN DOUBT (GENEVA 2773) - IS TO SEND <persName corresp="#p_NMA1">NAVILLE</persName> BACK TO LAGOS TO EXPLAIN SITUATION, HOPEFULLY WITH BIAFRAN EXPLANATION REJECTION <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> PLAN AND WITH FACTS AND FIGURES DEMONSTRATE WHY <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> COULD NOT REPEAT NOT BEAR INCREASE IN COSTS INCURRED BY LAGOS TOUCHDOWNS.

                                    <item>The federal governmentʼs immediate war aim is to establish federal control over Biafra. The federal authorities are willing to negotiate an end to the war, but we see no indications that Lagos would be satisfied with anything but a settlement on its own terms, including a renunciation of secession by the Biafrans and the establishment of federal authority--probably in the form of federal occupation forces--over the whole of the former Eastern Region. The federal government almost certainly would not accept General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> in any leadership position, and many Nigerians might well demand his death or imprisonment. There are no indications that Lagos would consider granting the East-Central State any special status in the federation. There is a remote possibility that the Nigerians would consider adjusting the East-Central State boundaries--possibly even to include a seaport at the expense of the Rivers State.</item>

                                    <item>Probably the most important long-range goal of those now in control of the federal military government is that of ensuring that no single tribe ever again dominates politics at the federal level. Since the military coup of July 1966, power has been held by minority tribal elements from the “middlebelt” area--the southern part of the former Northern Region. At the time of the July coup, the middlebelters had the support of the Hausa-Fulanis but this was primarily because the coup was directed against the then Ibo regime. The present aims of the middlebelters and the Hausa-Fulanis coincide, but the minority tribesmen remain determined to prevent domination of the government by the Hausa-Fulanis. In our view, an end to the Ibo problem would almost certainly mark the beginning of serious political differences between the minority tribesmen and the Hausa-Fulanis.</item>

                                    <item>The minority tribesmen now in control of the federal government are not bent on genocide against the Ibos, and the top leaders, like General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, will probably take <pb n="2" xml:id="d100-02" facs="d100-02"/>great pains to prevent the massacre of Ibos if the federal forces ever do overrun the Biafran enclave. It is almost certain, however, that a federal victory would result in anti-Ibo atrocities by front-line troops. The extent of these would probably depend on the manner in which the federal victory was achieved. The war has already gone on for so long and so much bitterness has built up on both sides, however, that during the first few days after the “liberation” there would probably be a fair amount of retribution particularly against Ibo soldiers and probably also against civilians. After this, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his senior officers would probably be able to contain the atrocities.</item>

                                    <item>There is of course no love lost between the Hausa-Fulanis and the Ibos, and even before the first military coup in January 1966 there was much pent-up anti-Ibo sentiment in the north. Over a million Ibos lived in the former Northern Region, and because of their education and ambition, they held the best jobs. The Hausa-Fulanis regarded the Ibos as pushy, arrogant, treacherous, greedy, and of course pagan. The depth of the anti-Ibo sentiment was demonstrated during the September-October 1966 riots in the Northern Region during which at least 7,000 and possibly twice that many Ibos were killed.</item>

                                    <item>These anti-Ibo feelings have probably become more intense since the war, and especially as it has become more and more difficult to explain the federal governmentʼs inability to win a military victory. Left to themselves, many, perhaps most, Hausa-Fulanis would probably punish the Ibos severely for the secession, and given the means, many northerners might well undertake a bloodbath of major proportions. Senior Hausa-Fulani officers would probably try to avoid this, however, and <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and the army leaders from the minority tribes would probably be able to contain the northern troops who would come into contact with the Ibos in the event of a federal victory. It is probably worthwhile to note that thus far in the war there have been no examples of what would happen if northern troops gained control of areas of heavy Ibo population, because the Ibos have evacuated their towns in the face of advancing federal troops.</item>

                                    <item>The Yorubas are also basically anti-Ibo. The Westerners see the Ibos as rivals for the better jobs and as cultural inferiors. Most Yorubas, however, probably feel much closer to the Ibos in education and background than to their northern brothers, and probably quite a few Yorubas sympathize with the Ibo attempt at self-determination. We do not believe the Yorubas would engage in any significant amount of atrocities against the Ibos.</item>

                                    <item>We do not believe that the military leaders intend to eradicate the Ibo elite, but neither do we believe the Ibos will be permitted to play any meaningful role in the federal government for the foreseeable future. The federal leaders almost certainly would not entrust any responsible federal positions to the Ibos. All the Lagos government has so far promised is that Ibos would control the East-Central State and that Ibos would be represented on the Federal Executive Council. We believe representation in the latter would probably be at best token, and that although Ibo civilians might be permitted to hold positions in the state government, the federal government would probably insist on federal occupation forces in Biafra.</item>

                                    <item>It is difficult to see any peaceful resolution of the problem of the Ibo elite if the federal government regains control of Biafra. Federal leaders appear firmly committed to the division of the former Eastern Region into three states--a factor which has won considerable support for Lagos among the Eastern minority tribes. If the Eastern Region is so divided, the Ibo elite would be confined to a very small, essentially rural area. These Ibos would not be accepted with ease in the other two eastern states or the Midwest State, and they would probably be afraid to move to the northern states. The Western and Lagos States already have a relative abundance of trained manpower among the Yorubas. Under the best of circumstances the confinement of the majority of the Ibo elite would provide significant problems for neighboring states, and under the circumstances which would prevail after the war, this situation would probably be a continuing source of serious trouble.</item>

                        <p>The following is an “aide memoire” on our talk today.</p>
                        <p>I strongly agree <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> should “direct” the Biafra peace initiative. But there are two problems:</p>
                        <p>1. A Direct White House Role in the Probe.</p>
                        <p>--Left alone, ER has to turn to <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>. Yet the Bureau (a) doesnʼt really want a settlement, (b) is hopelessly soft on the Feds, and (c) will concentrate on trying to trap the Biafrans and expose them in public.</p>
                        <p>--A State probe, without us along, wonʼt be credible to the Biafrans, who know <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> as well as I do.</p>
                        <p>--We must participate directly in the probe, clear all cables routinely, etc. if weʼre to protect the Presidentʼs interests and goals.</p>
                        <p>2. Timing</p>
                        <p>--State, by natural penchant and calculation, will drag their feet.</p>
                        <p>--Now is the moment to move. Both sides have military and political incentives to respond.</p>
                        <p>--Other tactical details can be left to ER working with us. Timing should be “immediate” as part of the instruction.</p>
                        <p>If the President approves your memo, I recommend your instruction to <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> include:</p>
                        <p>(i) My direct participation in the probe. (Even if it comes to going into Biafra --and, believe me, I donʼt relish dodging <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s--we just canʼt trust State to be neutral).</p>

                        <p>In response to your instruction to consider a Presidential initiative to conciliate Nigeria and Biafra, the following is a run-down of (1) the major elements we would have to deal with in peace negotiations at this point in the civil war; and (2) your options in directing the initiative, with a recommended plan of action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Two Sides</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your prestige would probably bring the parties together in fairly short order. The war has ground again to a bitter stalemate with no break in sight. Both sides could find reason at least to show up for a serious negotiating effort -- the Federals because they recognize that their chronic weakness in leadership and logistics will mean continuing military frustration; the Biafrans because they are realistically uncertain about their own prospects in a war of attrition.</p>
                        <p>The central problem is to get to the conference table and stay there in such a way as to avoid the histrionics and maneuvering that wrecked earlier mediation efforts by the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. As always, the two delegations will be looking nervously over their shoulder at skeptical colleagues back home while worrying about the motives of the mediator. Moreover, there is a special difficulty in the unevenness of the match -- the Biafrans are easily the more skillful bargainers, with an oft-proven capacity to embarrass or humiliate the Federals and even the third party. The Federals have learned this the hard way and will approach any talks very gingerly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Other Powers</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The British would clearly like the glory of reconciling their colonial offspring, but <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> is all too firmly dug in on the Federal side. For Whitehall, a US mediation effort would probably be an embarrassment at the least. And if negotiations issued in anything but a unified Nigeria, it would be a substantial failure of policy for <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> personally.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d102-02" facs="d102-02"/>
                        <p>The French would favor talks as a way out of de Gaulleʼs involvement in this nasty little war. But their commitment to Biafra is still strong enough to make them demand some comparable pressure from others on the Federals before using their own leverage (via arms supply) on <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>. Both Paris and the Biafrans would be watching our mediation effort closely for any favoritism toward the Federal side.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have everything to gain by a continuation of the war. Their stock rises steadily with the Federals in direct proportion to their arms supply and Nigerian resentment at the Western relief efforts in Biafra. Yet this is not a major investment for Moscow, and their influence is not decisive with the Federals. We would simply have to count on a natural Soviet penchant to scuttle our effort as best they could.</p>
                        <p>The Africans. Behind the ritual, declarations of <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> jurisdiction in this problem, the Africans are probably resigned to their obvious impotence and would quietly welcome a serious US initiative. <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> on the Federal side and Houphouet-Boigny with the Biafrans might be helpful at a critical moment. The African tolerance of outside intervention would be grudging, however, and we should expect charges in some quarters of “neo-colonialism” and “meddling”, particularly if we fail.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Settlement</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On top of all these tactical considerations, we would have to weigh very precisely the broad range of very complicated and stubborn issues which divide the two sides -- questions of amnesty, autonomy, oil revenues, tribal protection, etc. It will be a subtle and arduous process just to establish the possibilities for compromise. There may simply be none at this point. And even if there are, we run the risk that one or both sides would try to draw us into responsibility for the post-war arrangements.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, however, neither the costs of failure (African jibes and Soviet advantage) nor the potential risks of success (British pique and temptation to post-war involvement) should discourage a serious effort at mediation. Left to the parties, the war has three possible outcomes -- all inimical to our interests.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d102-03" facs="d102-03"/>
                        <p>1. Stalemate starves Biafrans, feeds Federal frustration with xenophobic dangers to our investments and nationals, helps the Soviets get a troublesome foothold.</p>
                        <p>2. A Federal military win means atrocities against the Ibos, Biafran guerrilla warfare sabotaging Federal oil (some US investments), and chronic instability in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>3. A Biafran military victory, if born of Federal exhaustion, could splinter Nigeria and create new irredentism analogous to the Middle East. Thus, it is clearly in our interests to get this war stopped in a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Options</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As I see it, we have four principal alternatives in tackling a settlement of the war. We would want as much help as we can get from other powers and the Africans in any case. The question is how to organize that support most effectively if we seize the initiative.</p>
                        <p>1. Four-Power Discussions. Discussions among the US, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France would have the advantage of going directly to the key issue of arms supply on both sides. But the French would be reluctant to enter what they see as a 3 to 1 line-up against Biafra, and the Africans would bridle at such a transparent reminder of their client status.</p>
                        <p>2. US-Canadian. Ottawa shares with us both an interest in stopping the war and the advantages of non-involvement. Then too, the Canadians are good negotiators with some shrewd African hands. There would be predictable problems, though, in orchestrating the effort. Canada could find herself in an awkward position between the British and the French.</p>
                        <p>3. US-Ethiopian. This approach has the obvious merit of covering our African flank. But we would be taking along a liability in that (a) the Biafrans simply donʼt trust the pro-Federal Emperor, and (b) the Ethiopians are not deep in staff talent, either in Lagos or Addis.</p>
                        <p>4. US Good Offices. The main advantage here is undivided control of the process and an unfettered pursuit of our own interests. With that freedom, of course, are the drawbacks of high exposure and undivided blame for what goes wrong.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d102-04" facs="d102-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The First Step</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do not think, however, that you need decide among these approaches as a first step in an initiative. On the contrary, it makes sense to do some very quiet spadework with the two sides to establish exactly what we have to work with, and thus where great power and African leverage should be applied.</p>
                        <p>There are two clear lessons of the past <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> failures: (1) the need to probe deeply the positions of the two sides and prepare carefully in secret before actual negotiations begin; and (2) the necessity of a scrupulously even-handed approach which is credible to the Biafrans (as <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and British efforts have never been). We can meet that first requirement most easily working alone. And we can satisfy the second with a quiet probe directed from the White House rather than State, which the Biafrans regard as staunchly pro-Federal.</p>
                        <p>I would propose a secret approach to both sides to test the basic willingness to accept mediation. We would be probing for possible overlap in positions, requirements for venue and public posture, the relationship of talks to a cease-fire or arms shipments, etc. We might do this with a special mediator brought in from the outside, but it would be best to direct the approach with less conspicuous members of our staff here.</p>
                        <p>In my view, we need this foundation of knowledge before we face the choice of how to proceed in terms of our own direct role and the relationship of the other powers. A probe which draws a blank will cost us nothing with the two sides. And it is well short of active mediation if the prospects seem too thorny to proceed.</p>
                        <p>From what we know now of attitudes on both sides, there is a reasonable chance of finding some common ground and building on it. But as I have sketched above, there are numerous pitfalls both in the substance of a settlement and the motives of other powers. I am persuaded we should move ahead with a peace initiative, but only after we have charted the ground as fully and as quietly as possible.</p>

                        <p>I see no problem in immediate action on the probe. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> has had the two sides together secretly in Geneva for another round of relief talks, but relief negotiations will -- and should -- proceed at their own pace apart from the deeper political issues. Our probe need not conflict in any way with concurrent efforts to break the relief impasse.</p>
                        <p>As for other peace initiatives, there are simply no wires to be crossed at the moment. The Popeʼs much-publicized effort during his trip last week to Kampala, Uganda was a total failure, taken seriously by neither side. The initiative we had discussed with the Ethiopians during the Emperorʼs visit -- an Ethiopian approach to the Federals with a Papal-directed black bishop going to Biafra --is languishing. The obstacles there are the Popeʼs lack of political leverage on Biafra and a general spirit of disillusionment among the Ethiopians. We would check again carefully, of course, not to offend other would-be peace-makers. At the moment, however, there seems to be a clear field -- and an obvious need -- to try to get the parties to talk sense about this largely senseless stand-off.</p>

                        <p>THE PROBLEM</p>
                        <p>To assess the possibility of a workable international embargo on arms to Federal Nigeria and to Biafra. Further, to assess the effects of such an embargo on the civil war and its ultimate settlement.</p>
                        <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. An effective embargo on arms shipments to both parties in the Nigerian civil war is highly unlikely. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be reluctant even to sign an embargo agreement for fear of jeopardizing their interests in Federal Nigeria, which is bitterly opposed to an embargo. France would see an embargo as benefiting <pb n="2" xml:id="d103-02" facs="d103-02"/>Biafra, but would not subscribe to an agreement unless the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did likewise. Moreover, private and governmental suppliers to both sides would be likely to evade any agreement that might be signed.</p>
                        <p>B. In the highly unlikely event of an effective embargo, the level of hostilities would soon diminish, but neither party would be anymore willing to compromise. Biafra would have achieved a measure of recognition and international intervention, but would remain a tiny enclave dependent on outside aid. The Federal Military Governmentʼs effort to force Biafra to renounce its claims would have been thwarted, and the resulting frustrations would probably reduce the authority and effectiveness of the Lagos government.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d103-03" facs="d103-03"/>
                        <p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>1. The civil war in Nigeria has entered its third year and neither side appears capable of decisive military victory in the foreseeable future. The Nigerian Federal Military Government (<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>) remains determined to bring Biafra back into the fold; Biafra appears equally determined to achieve independence, or at least autonomy. Neither side shows any inclination to compromise and numerous attempts at mediation have failed.</p>
                        <p>2. Both sides are dependent on imported arms and equipment. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> buys 15-20 percent of its military imports from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, about 30 percent from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe, and the rest mainly from assorted private arms dealers. For about the past year, France has directly or indirectly arranged the supply of at least half of Biafraʼs military imports. Much of the rest comes directly from private arms dealers. Biafran arms purchases are far smaller than the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d103-04" facs="d103-04"/>
                        <p>II. PROSPECTS FOR AN EMBARGO AGREEMENT</p>
                        <p>3. The idea of an arms embargo would be totally repugnant to the Nigerian side. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is hypersensitive to any suggestion that the two aides be treated as equals and has even regarded the discussion of British arms sales in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> parliament as interference in internal Nigerian affairs. The Federal government would immediately protest the suggestion of an embargo and would probably even threaten to sequester or expropriate the holdings of nations sponsoring the proposal. Popular reactions could include physical violence against resident nationals of sponsoring countries.</p>
                        <p>4. Biafra, by contrast, would probably welcome moves to bring about an embargo applying to both sides. General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, the Biafran leader, has repeatedly appealed to the international community to stop selling arms to Nigeria, hoping to drive a wedge between the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The Biafran authorities almost certainly reason that, in the unlikely event that an embargo use agreed to, it would be more likely to inhibit the British Government, perhaps even the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, than the covert sources -- French or other --from which Biafra obtains its arms. Biafra would expect such a move to hurt the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> far more than Biafra by giving the war an <pb n="5" xml:id="d103-05" facs="d103-05"/>international status, indirectly supporting Biafraʼs claim to independence, and making it more difficult for Nigeria to get supplies. Biafrans calculate that the longer they hang on, the greater will be the international recognition of their cause. Moreover, they appear to believe that if they can simply hang on long enough, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs campaign to subdue them will eventually cause so much dissension in Federal Nigeria that it will have to abandon the war. They probably reason that an arms embargo would cause consternation, recriminations, and disunity within the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and thus hasten its dissolution.</p>
                        <p>5. From the onset of the war in the summer of 1967, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has freely sold Nigeria small arms and ammunition essential to the conduct of a war of this type. It has, however, been reluctant to supply semi-sophisticated offensive weapons and has refused to sell aircraft. Nevertheless, in private conversations as well as in open Parliamentary debate, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> has argued that only by continuing to sell arms to the recognized government of a Commonwealth country engaged in repressing an internal rebellion can the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> hope to reimin much of its traditional influence in <pb n="6" xml:id="d103-06" facs="d103-06"/>Nigeria and to protect its interests there.(1) Further, it has argued that only by such a policy could it hope restrain the Nigerian hawks and eventually steer the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> toward a negotiated settlement. Recently, less has been heard of these reasons, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has stressed the need to prevent the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from becoming the sole or major source of <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> war materiel. As the war has dragged on with no diminution in the suffering and casualties and no end in sight, this policy has come under attack.</p>
                        <p>(1) British public and private investments in Nigeria (including Biafra) probably amount to at least $500 million, a good part of this in oil holdings. Also, at least 20,000 British citizens live or work in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would probably be glad of an effective international agreement to embargo arms to both sides, but it would have doubts about the prospect of enforcing an embargo and about the willingness of other parties to cooperate. Therefore, it could be expected to be reluctant to undertake the exercise. It would fear that discussion of such an agreement would not be kept private and that its exposure would adversely affect British interests in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>7. For the Soviets, Four Power talks on Nigeria would imply recognition of their interests in an area until recently a Western <pb n="7" xml:id="d103-07" facs="d103-07"/>preserve. Moreover, they might consider it useful -- for example, because of their China problem -- to improve the atmospherics of their relations with the US; in these circumstances, they might be more accommodating on an embargo if they thought the US set great store by this issue. But we think it far more likely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would refuse to join an international embargo agreement. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be extremely reluctant to risk such influence in Nigeria as its arms aid has brought, and would be skeptical about the effectiveness of the embargo -- especially as regards arms to Biafra. The Soviets would probably decide to warn the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> that plans for an international embargo were being discussed. By so doing they would seek to place the onus on the West and gain greater influence in Lagos.</p>
                        <p>8. Moscow is not completely comfortable in its support of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. Although the Soviet position in Nigeria has improved markedly since the war began, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has kept it from being as favorable as the Soviets had hoped. There have been irritating bilateral problems, many of which have been exacerbated by Nigerian failure to win the war. The Soviets maybe wondering bow much longer the war will remain an asset for them. <pb n="8" xml:id="d103-08" facs="d103-08"/>Nevertheless, the Soviet attitude toward an arms embargo will depend primarily on that of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>; and thus chances for Soviet acceptance are slim.</p>
                        <p>9. Within the past year, France has become the main supporter of Biafraʼs war effort; in particular, at least half of Biafraʼs arms are acquired with the help of France, although nearly all came through intermediaries. De Gaulle and his successors, without extending formal diplomatic recognition to Biafra, have publicly expressed French support of Biafraʼs right to self-determination. This policy appears to stem from a mixture of motives, including sympathy for the Biafrans, anti-Anglo-Saxon sentiments, and concern about the potential role of a strong and united Nigeria in West Africa in relation to Franceʼs former colonies in the area, particularly the Ivory Coast. The fact that a state-owned French oil company has prospecting and mining leases in promising areas in Biafra probably bolsters the French position but is by no means a decisive factor. In any event, de Gaulleʼs policy has kept Biafra afloat and incurred remarkably little African disapproval. The new French Government has shown no signs of changing it.</p>
                        <pb n="09" xml:id="d103-09" facs="d103-09"/>
                        <p>10. French reaction to any proposal for an international embargo would probably include a reminder that France has officially embargoed arms to both sides and a reiteration of previous denials that it is supplying either side. At present, France opposes Four Power talks on the problem because it thinks the other three are too anti-Biafran. In general, however, France would probably be willing to participate eventually in such talks because of its desire to advance its Great Power claims, and particularly if it thought talks would in some fashion aid the Biafran cause. France would probably view the declaration of an international embargo as a step in this direction. Whether or not France would then agree to reduce or end its assistance would probably depend first on how much the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs supplies were actually reduced and secondly on how the struggle was going.</p>
                        <p>11. Arms also are supplied by or come from many other countries. Some governments which supply arms or permit shipments are motivated by political sympathies, others by profit. Not all could be persuaded to go along with an embargo, and some would continue to permit commercial arms dealers to operate.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d103-10" facs="d103-10"/>
                        <p>III. PROSPECTS FOR FORCING AN EMBARGO</p>
                        <p>12. Even if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, France, and other European countries were to agree to an international embargo, a complete cessation of arms shipments to both sides is inconceivable. Both the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and Biafra already get up to half their military supplies through the black and grey arms markets, largely in Europe. Both have had two years in which to establish the necessary contacts and channels. A number of the smaller European countries -- including the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden -- declared an embargo on arms shipments to either side months ago, yet arms continue to funnel through them. Some countries -- such as Gabon, Portugal, and the Ivory Coast -- might refuse to join in the embargo, but even if they did, they might choose not to enforce it and might allow transit rights to Biafra. Nigeria, possessing open airfields and ports, could admit whatever ships or aircraft it chose. Thus enterprising dealers could put arms into both sides through transshipments. Even if all countries which declared an official embargo made strong efforts to enforce it, legal technicalities, false invoicing, and other dodges would be open to enterprising dealers.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d103-11" facs="d103-11"/>
                        <p>13. It is also likely that some countries agreeing to an embargo would give it only lip service. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could easily channel arms through Algeria, Sudan, or the UAR -- all declared supporters of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> -- in an effort to retain its favorable image with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. For similar reasons, and to protect British citizens and British investments in Nigeria, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could end government-to-government transactions but allow less visible arrangements to continue. France could easily continue to support Biafra, providing money and letting the Biafrans make their own arrangements.</p>
                        <p>IV. IMPACT OF A FULLY ENFORCED EMBARGO</p>
                        <p>14. In the highly unlikely event of an effective embargo, the level of military activity would soon diminish. Because of smaller stockpiles, Biafra would almost certainly be the first to run out of ammunition. But the Biafran guerrilla forces have had some practice in capturing supplies, rifles, and ammunition from their enemies and would certainly intensify their efforts. Although both parties tend to use up ammunition nearly as fast as it is delivered to the front, Biafra has had far more experience in conserving or rationing supplies. Moreover, the Biafran Army is slightly better organized and disciplined and might take <pb n="12" xml:id="d103-12" facs="d103-12"/>more readily to guerrilla warfare. Although the Federal stocks are almost certainly larger, <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> commanders have been more dependent upon armored cars and artillery to support their operations and thus would presumably suffer relatively more if they were denied such materiel. Nevertheless, Federal forces would probably be able to make further advances along the main roads. But military activity would soon bog down and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could almost certainly not achieve a decisive victory.</p>
                        <p>15. While an embargo would be likely to reduce the level of military activity, it would neither change the goals nor reduce the hostility between the warring parties. Biafra would have achieved two of its major objectives -- a form of international intervention in the war and a measure of recognition as an equal party in the dispute. It would be left with at least some territory under its control, though it would be a tiny enclave dependent on outside aid. But the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs effort to force Biafra to renounce its claims would have been thwarted. The resulting frustration would probably reduce the authority and effectiveness of the Federal government.</p>

                        <p>Having slept (with only an occasional nightmare) on our decision to launch a full-fledged initiative, I suggest that itʼs none too soon to begin thinking about what we do if, by some slim chance, the thing begins to work. The following are my own first thoughts at covering important bases:</p>
                        <p>1. Security. I strongly recommend that we henceforth christen all traffic in this exercise as NODIS-NETTLE -- after the poetʼs “Grasp the nettle, danger/ Pluck from it the flower, peace.” The survival of the probe surely depends upon its secrecy, and we are showing our hand pretty baldly as it is with the Red Cross, <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, etc. We should do all we can in Washington and the Embassies to minimize the risk of our own leakage of details. There are, after all, those in this government who are less than impartial on the outcome of this war. Besides, a NODIS label ensures that our principals will keep abreast without our worrying about it.</p>
                        <p>2. Canada. We have to level with the Canadians after the Presidentʼs offer to Trudeau of “complete consultation.” Moreover, Ottawa can be a useful ally with both the British and the French. I think it makes sense to give the Canadians a special nod by sending someone up to have a frank chat with Ivan Head in Trudeauʼs office.</p>
                        <p>3. Washington staffing. If we do start shuttling back and forth in Switzerland comparing notes on the real issues of the civil war, it seems to me that weʼll need a small but full-time group of people with some special knowledge to do some instant analyses here in Washington. For starters, that means someone thoroughly expert in Nigeria, a military adviser, a relief expert, etc. I think it is clear to all of us that we are already spread perilously thin, not to mention staffing a negotiating team in Geneva, etc. Our problems will be ten-fold if we actually get some delegations to give us serious replies. I donʼt see how we can do without a Task Force, and we <pb n="2" xml:id="d105-02" facs="d105-02"/>should begin to think now about personnel and procedure.</p>
                        <p>I beg your indulgence of this nosing in your own organizational business. But with the meetings of the last two days, I see us more than ever as Schopenhauerʼs porcupines huddling for a long cold night.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName>
                            <lb/>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs<lb/>The Summer White House<lb/>San Clemente, California</p>
                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>:</p>
                        <p>The two main points of my report on Nigeria and Biafra are; first, it may be a serious error to base a policy on the probability of early Federal victory; second, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> may be in a position to play an effective role in bringing the war to an end.</p>
                        <p>Let me briefly develop these two points.</p>
                        <p>1) The Biafrans are demonstrating sustained resistance capabilities. There is no shortage of arms, nor is there likely to be one. About 90%
of Biafran military equipment is obtained not from France but from Nigerian forces, which has difficulty in maintaining its lines of supply. The Federal government “occupies” most Biafran territory but does not control it. Biafran strategy is one of strategic initial retreat along the main roads, followed by systematic and highly trained guerrilla activity against Nigerian lines of supply. This strategy was responsible for the recapture of the entire Owerri area - far more important, strategically, than the loss of Umahia. Incidentally, there is a better than fair probability that Umahia will be retaken within three months.</p>
                        <p>The continuing critical food shortage should be considered in the light of two facts. First, the most serious part of the problem by far pertains to the refugee population (between three and five million people; no reliable records available). The resident population will probably be able to get by. Second, the large crops planted by the land army are just now coming in. Hence, the food situation may be a serious but not decisive factor in Biafraʼs ability to persevere.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d106-02" facs="d106-02"/>
                        <p>2) The significance of the present military standoff is that a precarious opportunity now exists for bringing about talks. Neither side is so strong that it has unlimited confidence in its ability to achieve its objectives by force. Yet neither is so weak that it fears its bargaining power would be seriously reduced.</p>
                        <p>How long the present balance will last is difficult to say. What we do know is that the Federal government has given some hints of its readiness to negotiate and Biafra has made a specific statement to the President on the matter.</p>
                        <p>This brings us to the possible role of the President.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> told me he is prepared to hold talks without pre-conditions immediately but he is certain that General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is not. This is precisely what General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> believes about General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. Both sides have indicated an interest in having a respected third party take responsible initiative in proposing or facilitating talks. There is an opening for the President, therefore, to convey separate, unofficial, and secret word to both sides that he is prepared to urge negotiations if the leaders think any useful purpose will be served by so doing.</p>
                        <p>You have asked me what I would say to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> on my return to Lagos. I intend to reiterate that I brought to General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> the Generalʼs message of peace with justice and mercy and that I have reason to believe that the message was seriously considered. Also, that on my return to the United States, I conveyed to the President through you the report of my private and unofficial trip to Nigeria, reporting my clear impression that the Presidentʼs good offices would be welcomed in the present situation. I would also say to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> that the President expressed a deep interest but would feel free to proceed only if he had from both sides specific encouragement and a clear indication of the kind of initiative he might take that would optimize the chances for successful negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I would have with me private letters from the President that would give substance to this view. The drafts enclosed are suggestions in that direction.</p>
                        <p rend="right">Sincerely,</p>
                        <p rend="center">Enclosures</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Norman:</p>
                        <p>I understand you are returning to Lagos. It would please me deeply if you would convey to His Excellency, Major General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">YAKUBU GOWON</persName>, expressions of my high regard and respect.</p>
                        <p>Your report of your meeting with His Excellency was of the deepest interest to me. I note especially the point you make concerning General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs desire to bring about peace with justice and mercy and the fact that he is resolutely opposed to any approach that will retard the essential process of reconciliation and reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>Your report indicates that General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> would welcome any steps or measures that would have the effect of persuading the leaders of the Eastern region to agree to peace talks without preconditions. You have also indicated that you believe the United States might perform a useful function towards this end.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the United States has no warrant or desire to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations. If it is felt, however, that the good offices of the United States would be useful in advancing the possibilities for meaningful negotiations, I am of course eager to assure General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> of our desire to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>In your capacity as private citizen, therefore, I hope you will convey to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> these sentiments and obtain his further views <pb n="4" xml:id="d106-04" facs="d106-04"/>about the kind of initiatives he believes we might usefully take in bringing about effective negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="right">Sincerely,</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d106-05" facs="d106-05"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Norman:</p>
                        <p>On your return to Biafra, I should be grateful to you if you would thank General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">C. Odumegwu Ojukwu</persName> on my behalf for his letter. I am most pleased by his most generous and gracious comments on the voyage to the moon; I agree with him that great as are the achievements in outer space, manʼs greatest achievement of all will be to make his own planet safe and fit for human life. I can think of no finer distinction for the United States than to contribute towards that goal.</p>
                        <p>It is in this sense that I of course respond affirmatively to General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs suggestion that we do whatever we can to bring about negotiations. I should be grateful to General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> if he could advise me further on the kind of proposals we might make that he believes might lead to effective negotiations. Is it General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs opinion that the United States, or any other nation or nations, should have a role in the talks themselves?</p>
                        <p>I am certain General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> recognizes that the United States has no desire to superimpose itself upon the efforts of other nations to deal with their problems. At the same time, I recognize with General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> that unresolved tensions, in todayʼs world are a matter of common concern to all the worldʼs peoples. Our planet has become <pb n="6" xml:id="d106-06" facs="d106-06"/>much too small for anything except a great unifying idea.</p>
                        <p>My compliments to General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> and my best wishes to you on your journey.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I understand that the President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> when they were last together in California to look into the question of mediating the Nigerian civil war. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> is apparently scheduled to see the President Friday, August 22, to give his response.</p>
                        <p>State/<gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>ʼs recommendation to the Secretary for this meeting is at Tab A. (The memorandum is being pouched to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, and you are probably seeing this bootleg copy before he sees the original. )</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> memo reflects Dave Newsomʼs readiness, as I described to you earlier, to begin a negotiating effort. But while <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs original penchant was for a very cautious indirect approach, the fear of steadily worsening relations with the Feds over the relief impasse (and, I suspect, a wish to accommodate the Presidentʼs apparent readiness to move) produced a recommendation to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> that State be authorized to launch a full-fledged probe immediately. The elements in the State plan boil down as follows:
<list>
                                <item>-- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> flies to Lagos next Monday to assuage prospective Federal wrath over a long-standing but oft-postponed US commitment to supply 2 more cargo planes to the Church airlift into Biafra, which the Feds regard as illegal. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> tells <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> we are holding off on the planes for the airlift for a few more weeks and, in the meantime, we want to try to get talks started between the two sides. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> asks, in effect, if the Feds will give us a chance to play honest broker. He emphasizes that weʼre on the Federal side and want the war to end with a unified Nigeria. He promises to lean on the French to bring around the Biafrans;</item>
                                <item>-- <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> reconvenes the cross-river talks in Geneva, as scheduled, August 25. In low key, with each party <pb n="2" xml:id="d107-02" facs="d107-02"/>separately, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> tries to probe for a readiness to expand the Geneva venue to political discussions or at least talks about talks;</item>
                                <item>-- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> returns from Lagos and <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> recesses the Geneva discussions for the two of them to meet in Paris September 1 with <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> to ask for French help in the US initiative (assuming, that is, the Feds gave their OK earlier in Lagos);</item>
                                <item>-- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> will have informed the British of our gambit on the way to Lagos and will report to London again on the way home from Paris;</item>
                                <item>-- At the end of this first round, the Feds and Biafrans are supposed to be talking politics with <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> in Geneva, with their British and French patrons respectively urging them on;</item>
                                <item>-- Through it all, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> will have been speaking with the personal authorization of the President and everything will be super secret with no publicity of any sort.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is very roughly the pattern I had in mind in recommending a probe of both sides in the memorandum for the President you took to California. The crucial difference, however, is that Stateʼs idea of a probe, predictably enough, is heavily weighted toward the Federal side. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> is currying the Feds with reassurances of our fidelity to one Nigeria, and we apparently expect the Biafrans (and indirectly the French) to come running to the table at a nod.</p>
                        <p>I certainly agree that we should move quickly if we are to salvage any influence in Lagos for a negotiating gambit. The constant pulling and hauling on relief negotiations and the continuing frustration over the military stalemate is indeed poisoning the atmosphere in Lagos. I suspect delivery of two more cargo planes to the Church relief airlift will be regarded by <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and Co. as a hostile act by the US. Thus, it is important to do some frank talking in Lagos about our relief obligations, and to make a strong effort to get the Feds to the conference table before weʼre out in the cold.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d107-03" facs="d107-03"/>
                        <p>But eager as the Biafrans are for negotiations, our good offices will be suspect to both <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> and the French if we are not scrupulously even-handed in our approach. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> can “hope” (for the Fedsʼ benefit) that the two sides negotiate a reunification, but we simply cannot go into a mediation effort committed a priori to the war aims of one side. And to match <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs demarche in Lagos, there should be a direct US invitation to the Biafrans -- either a quiet envoy to <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> or another approach through Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as I stressed in my talk with you before you left Washington, there should be a direct and visible White House hand in a mediation effort to reassure both the Biafrans and the French that this is not going to be another marriage made in Whitehall and Foggy Bottom.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation</p>
                        <p>That you weigh in with the President on this matter with three principal points:</p>
                        <p>1. A serious peace probe in Nigeria/Biafra does make sense in ending a nasty war and saving a gifted people. And the sooner, the better in light of a steadily worsening atmosphere between Washington and Lagos over the relief impasse.</p>
                        <p>2. But we protect our own options in the uncertain outcome of the war as well as the credibility of our mediation effort by being as even-handed as possible. Specifically, we should (a) formally probe the Biafrans just as we sound out the Feds, and (b) make no promises to either the Feds or the British that we are committed to one Nigeria as the outcome of the talks.</p>
                        <p>3. To strengthen our credentials with the Biafrans and the French (and to protect the Presidentʼs neutrality) there should be direct White House participation in whatever negotiating gambit we undertake.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The following is by way of further briefing for your meeting August 22 with the President.</p>
                        <p>A. Present Situation - Current circumstances and decisions associated with the Nigerian war threaten serious problems between the United States and the Federal Military Government. These could militate seriously against wider peace-seeking efforts by the US. At the same time these circumstances suggest opportunities for US action.</p>
                        <p>1. A continuation of the current relief impasse can place relations between the USG and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> under increasingly serious strains. If agreement is not reached on relief routes acceptable to both sides, domestic and international pressure will require the USG to sustain relief operations into Biafra probably against the vehement opposition of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Two additional C-97ʼs have now been promised to Joint Church Aid (USA) by September. <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, according to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> views, is operating an illegal airlift to Biafra. If these planes are delivered, this is certain to increase the strain between the USG and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The possibility exists that, in the next two weeks, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> relief effort may break down because neither side agrees to conditions for daylight flights. The question will arise of the disposition of the 4 C-97ʼs sold by us to the ICEC. (telegram attached)</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> is resuming talks with the two sides on the Cross River route in Geneva Auguet 25. This provides a unique opportunity to explore Federal and Biafran attitudes on peace, but such an exploration requires FTC authorization to its delegation. There is mounting <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> suspicion over our intentions re these talks and those with the French.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> is also tentatively scheduled to see French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> again when the latter expects to <pb n="5" xml:id="d107-05" facs="d107-05"/>discuss the political aspects of the war. This expectation is based on the fact that the French take credit for producing the Biafrans at the Cross River talks.</p>
                        <p>6. The Organization of African Unity meets in Addis Ababa with the Foreign Ministers meeting August 27-September 4 and the Chiefs of State September 6-9. The Nigerian war will be a major topic on which we plan to be solely an interested observer.</p>
                        <p>7. In the absence of other progress toward peace, the United Nations General Assembly may be faced with requests to discuss the Nigerian question. Such request, could not obtain inscription of the subject but could place us in a difficult position with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and many other African states.</p>
                        <p>8. While there are some indications of war weariness in Federal Nigeria, there is a continuing determination to end the war by military means. At the same time continued military activity threatens greater suffering and has brought, within the last two weeks, the first Biafran attacks) on American owned installations (Gulf Oil). These circumstances suggest a need for early action on our part.</p>
                        <p>B. Assumptions - In the above situation I am making the following assumptions.</p>
                        <p>1. That a decision in principle has been made to take a more active role in efforts toward peace.</p>
                        <p>2. At this stage, we should present no specific plan, that might run the risk of premature attack, but should concentrate on advancing our ideas and exploring the views and activities of the parties concerned and of other involved nations.</p>
                        <p>3. That our purpose should be to induce private negotiations between the two sides which need not initially be face to face but could be conducted through an intermediary.</p>
                        <p>4. That, while we will not at this stage seek precisely to define what we mean, our stated objective should be a solution within the framework of a single Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>5. That the British Government and the Federal Military Government of Nigeria should be informed of our intention before others, such as the French.</p>
                        <p>6. That we see little to be gained at this time, either from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration or from discussions with the Russians.</p>
                        <p>7. That we should continue our efforts toward relief.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d107-06" facs="d107-06"/>
                        <p>Our Alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, we appear to have two alternatives. We can run the risks of Nigerian reaction to these events, minimizing these as much as possible, concurrently examining the possibilities of a US peace initiative in a low key. Alternatively, we can undertake an immediate initiative designed to allay the fears of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and accelerate our own efforts to encourage moves toward peace.</p>
                        <p>The delay, while it has the risk of a serious reaction in Nigeria against US interests once the disposition of the aircraft is known, would have certain advantages.</p>
                        <p>1. By showing our hand right away in Lagos and London, we may draw fire from both the Nigerians and the British, who will be suspicious of our ultimate motives.</p>
                        <p>2. The Nigerians might not react well to pressure in the present circumstances when <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> negotiations are still in progress and before they fully explore the situation at the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. It is precisely because they fear we may seek, with Biafran encouragement, to discuss wider issues that the Nigerians are reluctant to participate in the Cross River talks.</p>
                        <p>4. Utilization of a special envoy to Nigeria now could reduce the usefulness of this possibility at a later time.</p>
                        <p>5. If, by facing the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> with so major a presentation on both peace-seeking and relief at this stage, we get a strongly negative response before the groundwork is laid through more gradual probes, our further effectiveness will be seriously impaired.</p>
                        <p>On balance, however, we believe the rinks to our interests are too great and the need to further the peace efforts too compelling. We would favor the alternative of immediate action. Under this plan, we would:</p>
                        <p>1. Ask the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> in the interest of our approach to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> on peace to hold up acceptance of the 2 C-97ʼc for four weeks;</p>
                        <p>2. Forestall <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> action on the other C-97ʼs for as long as possible.</p>
                        <p>3. I would proceed with Mr. Brubeck next week via London to Lagos <pb n="7" xml:id="d107-07" facs="d107-07"/>to inform the British and explain fully our intentions to the Federal Nigerians. My message would be that (a) the US was under strong pressure to facilitate relief. We understand the concerns of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. We were committed to provide additional aircraft to the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> but in the hopes that we can make progress on these issues we have postponed action, (b) the continuation of the war is inimical to the Federal Interest as well as ours, (c) the US wants the earliest possible negotiated settlement in the context of a unified Nigeria, and (d) I would like Federal cooperation in peace effort in which we will try to bring along the Biafrans by way of their French patrons.</p>
                        <p>4. While I am in Lagos, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> would be reconvening the Cross River talks in Geneva, and trying informally on the side to probe the two parties on political issues.</p>
                        <p>5. I would then proceed to Paris with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and would call on French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> for a continuation of the Franco-American dialogue on this subject. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs earlier conversations had touched upon not only issues of relief but political questions involved in the war. These approaches would be low key, however, and we could build on this or take a new tack as the reaction in Lagos seemed to warrant.</p>
                        <p>The advantages of this approach would appear to be:</p>
                        <p>1. Goes to the source of our problem in trying to soften the damage which will inevitably result from the C-97 transactions and the potential break down of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>2. Seeks to allay <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> suspicions arising from our continued conversations with the French and paves the way for further negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. A personal mission to Lagos by me--as a first step in our negotiating scenario--generally strengthens the credibility and support for a negotiated solution within the context of a single Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>4. Would attempt to exploit the current face to face talks between the parties in Geneva. We would urge the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> either to appoint a new representative, or appropriately instruct the Geneva delegation to deal with the political aspects of the war.</p>
                        <p>5. It is responsive to the Under Secretaryʼs pledge that the US Government would explore all possible avenues leading to a negotiated settlement.</p>

                        <p>Recommendation</p>
                        <p>1. I therefore recommend that you request the President to approve immediate action on our part along the lines suggested above.</p>

                        <p>The attached package may be either irrelevant or overtaken, but I am sending it on in utter confusion over the intentions of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> in the Nigerian problem. In brief:</p>
                        <p>1. I thought the Sec. was seeing the President this weekend on the question of a peace initiative. This, I thought, grew out of the oral request from the President to consider an initiative.</p>
                        <p>2. In that vein, <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> sent the Sec. the briefing and recommendation I sent with you in my latest memo to Henry on the subject. (in pouch of 21st)</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> recommendation to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> was for immediate action.</p>
                        <p>4. Earlier last week, however, <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> did send the Sec. a memo describing what they were planning to do before events in Nigeria overtook them. That memo, albeit superceded by the Bureauʼs later piece to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, now shows up on my desk as a memo to Pres. from Sec.</p>
                        <p>5. Upshot: 7th floor and Af are on different tacks, but impossible to tell at this point which will stick in <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>; discussions with the President on this.</p>
                        <p>6. So (you do follow this, donʼt you?) I am duly staffing the <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> memo I have; that is, the earlier <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> memo to the Sec., which <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> now regards as obsolete.</p>
                        <p>7. I regard both installments of the State memos as deficient, and have so indicated in HAKʼs memos.</p>
                        <p>Please call me (in the interests of my sanity as well as policy) if and when you learn anything which straightens any of this out. (I think if you read the attached, then peruse my last memo to HAK with bootleg State attachment, youʼll get the picture, Byzantine as it is!</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> reports on the actions planned by State to deal with the Nigeria/Biafra problem. The steps in summary:</p>
                        <p>-- Relief Coordinator <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> to continue his tentative and indirect exploration of both sides in the context of relief negotiations.<lb/>-- State to send an officer from the African Bureau to Europe and West Africa over the next 4-6 weeks to try to sound out negotiating possibilities without revealing U. S. intentions. We would only decide what action to take after this exploratory mission.<lb/>-- State to continue its emphasis on political support for Federal Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that we should move ahead promptly with an initial probe of negotiating positions in both Nigeria and Biafra. I am concerned over the State proposal in two respects:</p>
                        <p>1. The gradual and indefinite probe they propose over the next several weeks will probably raise more doubt and suspicion than anything else. For Africans -- who chronically suspect the Western powers of devious schemes -- playing coy in probing this problem will only diminish the credibility of whatever follows. Further, even some leading questions will tend to tip our hand and surrender the initiative to others, such as the French, who will want to exploit to their advantage any U. S. involvement.</p>
                        <p>2. The success of any U.S. mediation effort, now or later, will depend on an even-handed approach which is fair to Biafra. Thus we can ill afford to put ourselves too close to the Nigerians. State should cool its ardor for Lagos, at least for the sake of credible negotiations.</p>
                        <p>You have my views in detail on this problem. (My latest memo on a U. S. peace initiative is at Tab B.)</p>
                        <p>To seize the initiative in dealing with all parties and to protect the credibility of our own mediation with Biafra, the U. S. should launch a full-fledged probe of both sides, and be ready to follow-up with sponsoring negotiations. We <pb n="3" xml:id="d108-03" facs="d108-03"/>know where others stand on the conflict. The problem is to decide to move seriously ourselves -- and to avoid in the process any bias for one side that would destroy whatever chance we may have to help end this war.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>That you authorize me to instruct State to begin a prompt exploration of negotiating possibilities in both Nigeria and Biafra.</p>

                        <p>You should know that we are about to reach the moment of truth in the negotiations over the resumption of the Red Cross hall of the relief airlift into Biafra. You will recall that the Church agencies have continued flying relief at night in defiance of Federal restrictions, but the Red Cross halted all its flights following the June 30 decision in Lagos to require inspection on Federal territory.</p>
                        <p>Predictably, the Feds have been dragging their feet in negotiating a daylight flight arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. Thursday night the Committee met in Geneva and decided to put to the Feds a final take-it-or-leave-it proposal for an interim arrangement, which would allow Red Cross flights to go into Biafra from neighboring Dahomey with the Feds exercising only the option to call down random flights for inspection on Nigerian territory. The Red Cross has given the Feds until midnight Monday, September 1, to respond. If the answer is anything but yes, the Red Cross will simply pull out its operation.</p>
                        <p>Apparently it has finally dawned on <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and Co. that the Swiss have lost their patience, and the Feds -- uncharacteristically -- are holding a series of urgent meetings in Lagos to try to decide what to do. As you know from your talk with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName>, our Embassy will be pushing the Feds for an affirmative reply. But the odds are still less than even that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> can overrule his hawks, who would just as soon be rid of the Red Cross once and for all.</p>
                        <p>If the Red Cross departs, of course, this leaves the Church agencies and their “illegal” airlift as the only relief operation with a chance of stemming the starvation inside Biafra over the next few months. We will then face a choice of (a) supporting a relief airlift which the Feds regard as a violation of their sovereignty or (b) bowing out of the relief business in Biafra altogether.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d110-02" facs="d110-02"/>
                        <p>As I have indicated to you before, this climax of relief negotiations was inevitable. When the Red Cross goes, we will face two tough questions: (1) what to say in public, when both the Feds and the Red Cross will expect us to vindicate their respective positions, and (2) how we treat the Church agencies, who will almost certainly use the Red Cross departure to pressure us for more money and planes.</p>
                        <p>I am persuaded there is nothing we can do at this point but wait out the Monday deadline. Not even State can devise a way to save the Feds from themselves.</p>
                        <p>I will have an analysis on next steps for you to send to the President as soon as we know the decision in Lagos.</p>

                        <p>The past few weeks have seen a series of incidents in which the bureaucracy was either unresponsive to the Presidentʼs desires or displayed an extraordinary inability to coordinate matters within itself. These problems have too often been due to a failure to clear public statements and policy cables with the White House. These incidents are in addition to past problems with regard to SALT, Vietnam and the Middle East, with which you are familiar.</p>
                        <p>Failures of this sort are increasing in frequency, and if something is not done soon, the interests of the United States and the Presidency could be seriously damaged. In addition, we must now face the question of the Secretary of Stateʼs working relationship with me. If not, what seems to be an increasingly serious sort of bureaucratic guerrilla war may have very serious consequences for the management of our foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Nigeria.]</p>
                        <p>1. Nigeria/Biafra</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d111-02" facs="d111-02"/>
                        <p>In a note on a memorandum from me to him on April 8, and in subsequent notes, the President has made clear his desire to avoid a pro-Federal Government bias by the US in the Nigeria/Biafra conflict, and to lean more towards Biafra. The President indicated to the Secretary of State and myself a few weeks ago that he wished a US initiative to be under-taken which could speed the resolution of the conflict.</p>
                        <p>On August 25 -- without checking with the White House --the Secretary authorized the initiation of an initiative which would have prejudged the issue in favor of the Federal Government and would have been rejected by the Biafrans. On the same day, I raised the subject of Biafra with the President, without knowing exactly what the Secretary of State had been doing. The President informed me that he had not authorized an initiative, and asked that no move be made until after his return to Washington. When this decision was communicated to the State Department,* the Secretary in violent telephone calls to me and to a member of my staff insisted that he did not want the members of my staff spending so much time at the State Department and that all such messages to the State Department should be passed through him from me.</p>
                        <p>Such an arrangement would make everything an issue -- a test of strength -- and would mean that one or the other would have to back down. The dangers of this are clear. (In fact, there was a case a month ago in which the Secretary had issued an instruction which was clearly against the Presidentʼs wishes, as indicated in a memorandum I had received. But I did not attempt to have the Secretaryʼs instruction reversed since it was not an important matter and it would have undermined his authority over his Department.)</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Nigeria.]</p>
                        <p>*A technical mistake was made in communicating the Presidentʼs wishes. It was communicated by mistake from a member of my staff to a member of Stateʼs Bureau of African Affairs, rather than to the State Department Secretariat. (My staff member was in the State Bureau of African Affairs when he received the news, and he had no choice but to pass the word on when asked.)</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You will remember that I alerted you last week while you were in California that the long and tortuous negotiations between the Red Cross and the two sides in this conflict over the resumption of day-light flights were coming to a climax. As has been so typical in this muddled war, the negotiations have sputtered along this past week, with the Red Cross shrinking from one deadline after another in the hope that something could be salvaged. (The “indomitable” Swiss have finally met their match in the affinity of Africans for palaver.)</p>
                        <p>In brief, here is where we stand today:</p>
                        <p>--The Feds have agreed “in principle” to the Red Cross compromise plan which calls for neutral inspection outside Federal territory with the Nigerian right of random call-downs of air-craft on the way into Biafra. This agreement was extracted from <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> against the almost unanimous objection of his regime. But the Feds have yet to sign a formal agreement. Despite favorable public reaction world-wide, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> may yet be out-maneuvered by his hawks.</p>
                        <p>--The Biafrans (who laid low while the Red Cross argued with Lagos) are now pleading that they cannot agree to daylight flights without some suitable guarantee against Nigerian violations. They want some direct assurance from donor countries that at least diplomatic and economic sanctions would be applied to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> in the case of military violation. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, as I have indicated to you before, is absolutely adamant on this point simply because he regards the Uli airstrip as his lifeline and the Feds are entirely oblivious to unenforced utilization.</p>
                        <p>--Meanwhile the Red Cross sits in cluttery session in Istanbul comforted by what may still be the illusion of Federal acceptance and perplexed by the remaining Biafran objection on security grounds. The majority of the International Committee <pb n="2" xml:id="d116-02" facs="d116-02"/>is disposed to begin the flights (if the Nigerians do in fact agree) this Sunday with or without a Biafran response. Presumably, the aircraft simply will fly to Uli airfield and make the Biafrans sustain the moral opprobrium of turning them away.</p>
                        <p>--If daylight flights fall through, whatever the obstacle, we are still left with the present “illegal” night-time airlift run by the Church voluntary agencies. This operation, largely financed by the US and run with our surplus C-97ʼs, is apparently holding the line against mass starvation in the enclave. But the protein deficiency, with retardation and probably death for most children under 10, is reportedly rising rapidly.</p>
                        <p>As always, the question of daylight flights is crucial to the entire relief picture. With the resumption of the Red Cross airlift, the food supply in Biafra would rise dramatically and restore tenuously the level of subsistence they had achieved four or five months ago. Without the Red Cross airlift, the Church operation at the present level simply wonʼt be able to stave off deepening tragedy. We and the Feds may be able to soothe our conscience by blaming the Biafrans for sabotaging daytime flights, but that will not long obscure the fact that innocent civilians still will be dying in the enclave.</p>
                        <p>Diplomatically, the situation is still on dead center. The <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> summit at Addis this week produced the usual flurry of rumors, and the usual disillusionments as the actual results became known. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> still insists the Biafrans must renounce secession as a pre-condition for peace talks. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is not about to surrender that point before he gets to the table.</p>
                        <p>The next step in US policy has to take account of what happens in the next few days on the daylight airlift. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>ʼs talks in Geneva on the cross-river are in recess pending the airlift negotiations. But whatever happens on the relief front, it is clear that the war will drag on; the Feds are no nearer victory (and even in some respects further away from it) than they were a year ago. We face a mounting dilemma between a policy based on one Nigeria and the reality of Biafraʼs existence.</p>
                        <p>When the daylight airlift situation clarifies, I will have an analysis for you early next week on the broad choices we face.</p>

                        <p>Wednesday evening <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Roger Morris</persName> of my staff saw <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName>, as a sequel to my conversations with him in California. He is just back from Paris where he met quietly with Biafran Foreign Minister Onegbula.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> has a shrewd and well-informed appreciation of the realties of the civil war. He is convinced there is no doubt that the Biafrans want to negotiate, and quite possibly are looking toward some kind of reunified Nigeria. (They sent the same signals to <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> very clearly during his last trip to Geneva on relief matters.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName>ʼ message Wednesday, however, was that his usefulness as a prober was probably exhausted. Foreign Minister Onegbula is willing to talk further in a very quiet exploration, but is anxious to come here to talk to us directly. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> thinks it would be much less satisfactory, though still acceptable to the Biafrans, if he (<persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName>) went back to see Onegbula in Paris.</p>
                        <p>The object of this further exchange would be to pin down exactly how the Biafrans would propose to relate any negotiations to the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, what role they would expect of the US, and what public concessions they might be willing to make at the outset to help bring along the Feds. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> got only vague answers on these questions during his last trip; the Biafrans asked for this week to consult <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I strongly recommend that we keep this dialogue going, and preferably with a signal to the Biafrans via <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> that my staff would be available for a secret informal session to explore the question described above.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d118-02" facs="d118-02"/>
                        <p>We could ask <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> to return to Paris. But the Biafrans obviously want some proof theyʼre in a serious conversation with the Administration, and a talk here would give us maximum control as well as an undiluted appraisal. The penalty for a leak, as always, would be complete disavowal. Nor does our seeing the Biafrans commit us to anything. This would be a simple exchange of views in line with a dinner meeting <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> had with a Biafran Ambassador some weeks ago (which has never leaked).</p>
                        <p>In any case, we promised <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> a prompt reply. I think he deserves it for following our earlier request with both precision and discretion.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation -- That you authorize me to tell <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> that a member of my staff would be available for a strictly quiet, informal meeting with a Biafran representative in the next few days.</p>

                            <item>Presidential Initiative in Nigeria/Biafra Relief Impasse</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Biafrans have quietly approached my staff -- through a young MIT Scholar, Christopher Beal -- asking our help out of the current impasse on Red Cross relief flights. The problem is as follows:</p>
                        <p>--The Red Cross has proposed an internationally-inspected daylight airlift which neither side would exploit for military advantage.</p>
                        <p>--The Federals, after much hesitation, formally signed the agreement for a trial period of three weeks. In so doing, they committed themselves to a broad, non-specific pledge to refrain from attacking the Biafran air field during daylight relief operations.</p>
                        <p>--The Biafrans, however, have so far refused to agree to the Red Cross plan on the basis of their long-standing fear of a Federal violation of the airlift. Specifically, they worry that Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s will shadow relief planes for a sneak attack against the air field which is Biafraʼs sole lifeline for arms and food.</p>
                        <p>--The Biafrans are now asking us to make a public statement to “give a guarantee that Nigeria will not abuse the route”.</p>
                        <p>--This request has two distinct motives. First, the Biafrans are genuinely afraid the Feds will violate the agreement while the world looks on, with the result that Biafra loses <pb n="2" xml:id="d119-02" facs="d119-02"/>both relief and the air field. But second, they obviously want to escape the inevitable public opprobrium which will come with their refusal to match Federal acceptance of the Red Cross plan.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, the Biafrans have given us a chance to offer them a face-saving device which might well break the relief impasse. There can be no question -- and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> knows it -- of a U.S. “guarantee” or any implication of our direct involvement in policing the airlift. But we can seize this opportunity to offer:</p>
                        <p>1. A firm Presidential statement that we (as well as the Red Cross and other donors) understand the Federal pledge of military restraint to be a solemn and statesmanlike commitment.</p>
                        <p>2. A quiet offer to the Red Cross to (a) help them obtain simple but effective communications equipment to distinguish the relief aircraft from Federal fighters; and (b) help enlist the Canadians (who have already offered) as neutral observers in the relief planes and at the Biafran air field.</p>
                        <p>A proposed Presidential statement is at Tab A. It is entirely consistent with your earlier letters to all the parties in the relief problem. Tactically, it binds the Federal side by imputing the most praise-worthy motives to their agreement. It also warns the Biafrans we will not be maneuvered politically on the relief question. To bring around <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, however, it deposits a diplomatic warning to the Federals (without specifying our actions) in case they violate the relief airlift.</p>
                        <p>I believe the initiative here is worth seizing. The alternative is likely to be mounting starvation in the enclave, a steady worsening of our relations with the Federals, and complete reliance on the dangerous night-time airlift of the Church voluntary agencies, whose US-donated planes and American civilian crews are bound to be shot down by the Federal <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s sooner or later. A daylight flight arrangement is the only real remedy to these considerable risks.</p>
                        <p>If you approve this initiative, I will coordinate with the State Department both your statement and offer to the Red Cross, in order to produce a carefully-timed scenario for maximum effect on all parties.</p>

                        <p>Recommendation -- That you authorize (a) the Presidential statement at Tab A and (b) a quiet offer of help to the Red Cross in implementing an inviolable relief airlift -- in an effort to secure Biafran agreement to daytime flights.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: The main thrust of the arguments of Dr. Okgibo and his colleagues was (1) the United States should move away from its “one Nigeria” policy. (2) the United States should be willing to use economic and diplomatic levels to force Nigeria not to interfere with a relief program. (3) the United States should provide more assistance to Joint Church Aid and other participants in the night airlift to Uli. (4) It is unfair to rebuke Biafra for its reaction to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> agreement on daylight flights, since two different versions of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> plan are involved. (End Summary)</p>
                        <p>The Biafrans met with <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> for nearly three hours Monday, September 22 for a tour dʼhorizon. Asked for his impression of the relief situation, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said “everything is worse than it was in April.” He pointed out that last April things were bad but he had felt that with the increase in the airlift “we had turned the corner.” But since June, he said, “things have gotten worse and worse and worse.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight flight plan. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the United States was “bitterly disappointed” that the plan had not been accepted by Biafra. He said a great deal of diplomatic effort went into getting the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to reach agreement with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d120-02" facs="d120-02"/>
                        <p>Okgibo said the problem was the manner in which the matter was handled by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. “Everybody is talking about the agreement between the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and Lagos as if they are not aware that there are two documents, not one, two documents which are not identical either in terms of spirit or in terms of technical modalities,” Okgibo said.</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said it is premature for either side to be blamed for not reaching agreement. “The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> unfortunately,” he added, “made a public announcement on the negotiations as if to say this is the end of the road. I donʼt believe this is the end of the road.”</p>
                        <p>Both Okgibo and Eke emphasized Biafra wanted two assurances that (1) operation of the relief route will not make it easier for the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to take Uli, and (2) that there would be continuity.</p>
                        <p>Eke charged that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs basic objective “is to starve out Biafra” and that disrupting relief operations is in line with that policy. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> told Biafrans “we read your risk different than you did. We think the risk is not that great.” Eke said “whether you accept our analysis of the amount of risk involved we do know and believe we are opening ourselves up to a certain measure of risk.”</p>
                        <p>Okgibo took the position that negotiations on daylight flights have advanced “but have not been completed.” He told <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>: “I donʼt believe this is the end of the road. This is where your role as coordinator becomes quite crucial in exploring how the two agreements can be reconciled.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> pointed to three areas of disagreement, saying (1) the technical route is a matter of negotiability without anybody losing face; (2) The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> reservation on military operations refers to a right to keep up hostile action at night against Uli and is not a license to attack the relief operation; and (3) Biafraʼs insistence on guarantees is the major difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said the guarantee issue “is not an insuperable problem and should not be a bottleneck to reaching agreement.”</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d120-03" facs="d120-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> sought a definitive statement from the Biafrans on the kind of assurances or guarantees they sought, ruling out the use of military force. “You have a wider choice,” Okgibo said, “since you do not turn your own vision to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> as a single operating agency.”</p>
                        <p>Eke told <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> “we are for once asking other people to take on the responsibility of accepting Nigeriaʼs professed good intentions.” Biafra, he said, doubted Nigeriaʼs willingness to execute the terms of an agreement. “Instead of Nigeria giving us assurances over the radio,” he said, “let them give them to you and you let us know.”</p>
                        <p>Okgibo told <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> “we find very strong differences in the agreement between the Red Cross and Lagos and there is a need to remove these differences. Some effort should be made either by you or the Red Cross to resolve them. These are not difficulties arising from polemics. They are difficulties of substance.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the United States has not been directly involved in the negotiations. He recalled an earlier agreement that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> would handle daylight flights and the United States would concentrate on the surface route. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> stressed that “a major component of our policy is that relief must go in.” The question is, he said, what are we ultimately willing to pay to see relief go in?</p>
                        <p>He asked the Biafrans “short of military action what kinds of action would be contemplated in the event Nigeria violated the agreement?” He raised this hypothetical situation: From our own analysis we conclude there is a 98 percent probability that no abuse will take place, but if we are wrong and the agreement is violated, what kind of sanction will fit a situation where you say the problem is ensuring a continuing flow of relief?</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said “once you rule out military involvement there is a whole range of actions, private and public, that can be taken.” <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> asked would a public reprimand be accepted? “Public reprimand would serve some purpose but does not ensure continuity,” Okgibo answered. “A cut off in aid to Nigeria?”</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> asked. “This would be useful but it does not necessarily ensure the desired continuity,” Okgibo replied, declaring “material support to other carriers (i.e.<gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>) assures continuity.</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said a serious problem is that the U.S. mind is fixed on the proposition that if the Red Cross wonʼt carry relief nobody else will. “After the Red Cross halted its air-lift, if the other carriers had been able to step up their relief effort,” he said, “I donʼt think the situation would have developed to the present impasse.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> pointed out the night airlifts from Sao Tome and Libreville have continued because the Nigerian Air Force lacked a night fighter capability. Eke disagreed, saying “They have the will, the technical capability, but they have inadequate information.” Eke said Biafra wants to be indemnified, so that any action by Lagos against the relief operation “would not lead to our suffering a disability.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> agreement was a viable accord. Eke claimed U.S. was providing relief “to make it easier for us to go back to Nigeria.” <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> stated that the flow of relief is related to American concern that the asset represented by Biafra be preserved.</p>
                        <p>Eke said “the reason relief is going in is because there has been a distinct entity called Biafra which has forced its way into world public opinion and has succeeded in having its voice heard.” As long as the United States supported a policy that Nigeria should include Biafra, there will be no easy solution to the relief problem, Eke declared.</p>
                        <p>Okgibo siad the United States has spent a lot of effort and funds on the relief issue. “I think you should have been rewarded with better results,” he said. “The chances of that reward keep getting slimmer and slimmer,” he said.</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, as a result of its June 30 policy statement, had thrown politics “right into the center of the relief effort.” <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> reminded Okgibo that the government in Lagos is not uniform, not monolithic, that there are differences of opinion ranging from “starving them out” all the way to General Gowan, who legitimately feels “relief ought to go in.”</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d120-05" facs="d120-05"/>
                        <p>Okgibo retorted that “whether you have a soft or hard version, when it comes to action, whether articulated or not, the hard version prevails.”</p>
                        <p>Eke repeated his contention that the relief issue boils down to what the United States prefers, a separate Nigeria and a separate Biafra or one Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said Biafraʼs refusal to accept the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> plan “has done a great deal of damage to your position in terms of ordinary people who are interested in appearance and not involved in historical nuances.” Okgibo said “you can talk, about disappointment that the problem has not been solved. This I accept, but not disappointment about Biafraʼs attitude… I donʼt think there is good ground in rebuking Biafra for the way it has acted. We donʼt consider the matter closed. Guarantees in themselves cannot be a stumbling block.”</p>
                        <p>Cross River route. Okgibo said Biafra still believes the surface route is more important than the flights. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the route proposal has not been dropped. He recalled that two sessions on the proposal had been held in Geneva and “I intend to try to get a conclusion at the third session in mid-October.” Both <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and Okgibo agreed that there is a need to “shore up” the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> for a major role in the operations of the route.</p>
                        <p>One Nigeria concept. Okgibo said the opinion that Nigeria would be better with Biafra in than out “is a fast vanishing one.” He said this “provided the underpinning of policy some time ago, but is not an opinion that has held or is likely to hold in the future.”</p>
                        <p>Apart from the humanitarian issue, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said, “the stakes are so small that there wonʼt be a change in U.S. policy.” A definite part of U.S. policy, he said, is the war has got to stop.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d120-06" facs="d120-06"/>
                        <p>Okgibo said options should be kept open. “Instead of talking about a desired solution, emphasize that what is worked out by the parties concerned is acceptable,” he said. “all the help one needs now is diplomatic pressure on both sides and their well-wishers on both sides that any solution they can evolve, whether within the context of one Nigeria, an independent Biafra and Nigeria, would be acceptable. Ultimately, this is in your own interest.”</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said the “moment an outsider begins to prescribe a solution, you are already undermining the possibility of a solution.”</p>
                        <p>Eke said what has been happening in Western Nigeria should not be underplayed. “One can easily see,” he said, “that pressure to keep Nigeria united is more from outside than inside.” He claimed Nigeria is sustained through a mixture of diplomatic and economic actions of the United States. “I believe,” he said, “Nigeria is very happy not because of British support but because the United States implicitly supports her and so does Russia.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> repeated his point that there is no imperative to change U.S. policy toward Nigeria. “Why does it become so hard for you to swallow a ʼsingle Nigeriaʼ and then work out what a ʼsingle Nigeriaʼ will be?” he asked the Biafrans.</p>
                        <p>Okgibo said “the day we say we accept in principle a ʼone Nigeria,ʼ Nigeria will say to us, ʼif you accept it, then you demonstrate your good intentions by doing “a,” “b,” and “c.” He added: “We are not interested in names. What we want is security for our people. This can be worked out at the conference table.</p>

                        <p>Apropos your “supposition” at this morningʼs staff meeting that there were some errant cables on Nigeria, I had a classic example this morning.</p>
                        <p>Attached at Tab A is a recommendation from Lagos (telegram 8488) for the arrival statement of our new Ambassador. Aside from the rather strained historical analogy of the United States, the statement ends with a ringing declaration altogether contrary to the Presidentʼs policy as I understand it (passage underlined).</p>
                        <p>As per your instruction, I certainly intend to raise a red flag on this with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, in the same vein, I have attached at Tab B a cable (Lagosʼs 8484) from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs new Nigerian Office Director, recommending that the President write a love letter to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>.

                        <p>1. THERE FOLLOWS SUGGESTED DRAFT ARRIVAL STATEMENT FOR AMBASSADOR TRUEHEART.</p>
                        <p>BEGIN TEXT: “IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR A NEW AMBASSADOR ARRIVING IN A COUNTRY TO ISSUE A STATEMENT CONTAINING PLATITUDES AND GENERALITIES. IT IS TEMPTING FOR ME TO DO SO TODAY. BUT YOU AND I KNOW THE ISSUES FACING NIGERIA TODAY AND RELATIONS BETWEEN NIGERIA AND THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT PERMIT AVOIDANCE OF CERTAIN HARD AND TROUBLESOME FACTS. IT MAY BE, HOWEVER, THAT IN FACING THESE ISSUES SQUARELY NIGERIANS AND AMERICANS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER.</p>
                        <p>“FIRST, NIGERIANS ARE FIGHTING NIGERIANS IN A BITTER CIVIL WAR TO RESOLVE WHETHER THIS COUNTRY CAN SURVIVE AS AN IMPORTANT, VIABLE NATIONAL ENTITY -- OR WHETHER IT MAY FRAGMENT AS ONE ETHNIC GROUP ATTEMPTS SECESSION. MY GOVERNMENT AND AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THIS TRAGIC DILEMMA. AMERICAʼS SURVIVAL AS A NATION WAS ONCE SO THREATENED AND WE FOUGHT A FOUR-YEAR WAR TO INSURE “ONE NATION…INDIVISIBLE…ʼ</p>
                        <p>“SECONDLY, NIGERIAʼS PROBLEM OF RECONCILIATION OF HER DIVERSE ETHNIC GROUPS COULD BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE WAR. AGAIN RECONCILIATION OF DIFFERING PEOPLE BECAUSE OF RACE, RELIGION, AND NATIONAL ORIGIN HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH WHICH MY COUNTRY HAS BEEN SEIZED FOR YEARS AND WHICH <pb n="3" xml:id="d121-03" facs="d121-03"/>NOW EMPLOYS OUR FULLEST ENERGIES AND RESOURCES. AMERICA UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS NIGERIAN PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE.</p>
                        <p>“THIRDLY, BECAUSE AMERICA IS A FEDERATION OF 50 PROUD AND DIFFERENT STATES, WE APPRECIATE THE PROBLEMS IMPLICIT IN NIGERIAʼS NEW FEDERAL VS. STATES RELATIONSHIPS.</p>
                        <p>“OUR COUNTRIES ARE LARGE AND HAVE GREAT ECONOMIC POTENTIAL. MORE IMPORTANTLY, BOTH HAVE GREAT HUMAN TALENT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE, YOUR NATION AND MINE, SUCCESSFULLY HARNESS THE TREMENDOUS HUMAN RESOURCES WITH WHICH WE ARE BOTH ENDOWED MAY BE THE MEASURE BY WHICH WE ARE JUDGED.</p>
                        <p>“FINALLY, PERMIT ME TO REITERATE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- REPEATED ATTEMPTS BY COUNTERPROPAGANDISTS TO THE CONTRARY -- HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT SUPPORTS THE CONCEPT OF “ONE NIGERIA.” MY GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR, BUT LET NO ONE CONFUSE THIS CONCERN WITH OUR CLEAR POLICY OF SUPPORT FOR THE “ONE NIGERIA” ON WHICH THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT AND THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY INSIST.</p>
                        <p>“WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN OF THE IBO PEOPLE FOR PROTECTION AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WITHIN THE COUNTRY. THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENTʼS UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCERN IS REFLECTED CLEARLY IN THE FAR-REACHING SECURITY GUARANTEES IT HAS OFFERED.</p>
                        <p>“MRS. TRUEHEART AND I ARE GENUINELY PLEASED TO BE HERE. WE SOLICIT YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WE EMBARK ON OUR FIRST DAYS IN A NEW COUNTRY.” END TEXT. GP-3</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">Introduction</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> opened by stressing the circumstances under which the US was entering this conversation. He said he had been authorized to follow up in person, as Onyegbula had requested, the earlier talks with <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Norman Cousins</persName> and the Foreign Ministerʼs letter to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>. He wanted it understood, however, that these were strictly informal explorations, implying no US commitment of any kind. Absolute secrecy was essential if there was any hope of continuing the dialogue and he hoped for a thoroughly candid and authoritative exchange of views. <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> noted that both Biafra and the U.S. may have been guilty in the past of speaking with several voices. He said it was essential in discussing these serious matters of war and peace that the dialogue be kept in a single channel which clearly reflected the policy of the two principals. He said he wanted to make these points clear at the outset, but had come primarily to ask questions and listen.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula replied that Biafra was generally opposed to pre-conditions, but would readily accept all those the U.S. had stipulated for these conversations. He was very heartened by this response to <pb n="2" xml:id="d122-02" facs="d122-02"/>his letter to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. He wanted to begin the talk with some points of Biafraʼs attitude toward the United States. Biafrans had grown up in the western tradition and identify naturally with the U.S. And although we were allied with the British and thereby had supported the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, most Biafrans still looked upon the U.S. as neutral in the civil war. They may have been particularly encouraged by the sympathy shown by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during his campaign. But Onyegbula stressed that the Biafran Government had found the actual policy of the new Administration very disappointing thus far. The U.S. had not understood, in his view, that Biafra signalled a major change in the shape of African politics, and that self determination in Africa was a direct reflection of American ideals. Onyegbula said he hoped this conversation is the start of more realistic and productive U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> replied that he had not come to carry on a post-morten of past U.S. actions, or to discuss the merits of either side in the civil war. This exploration could be useful only if it were both dispassionate and highly practical. He had come to see if there was any way an outsider might be helpful in ending the war. He wanted to concentrate on practical considerations, and particularly some of the points raised in Onyegbulaʼs letter to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. Onyegbula agreed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Starting Negotiations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked Onyegbula to comment further on the assertion in his letter that Biafra would pose no pre-conditions -- neither a cease-fire nor claim to independence -- prior to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula said at least “preliminary meetings” could be held without a cease-fire. And these meetings would be important to establish the climate for a meeting of principals. He stressed, however, that an ultimate agreement on the basic issues had to be reached by the principals, General <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> could not be expected to take the risk of attending such negotiations while the fighting continued. Negotiations had made no headway in the past, he thought, primarily because the war was going on. Besides, he thought a cease-fire would only enhance the authority of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> because it would leave them under control of a substantial portion of Biafra. But he emphasized again <pb n="3" xml:id="d122-03" facs="d122-03"/>that a cease-fire was not a pre-condition for peace talks. Biafra proposed no pre-conditions; and they could not be expected to accept the current Federal insistence that they acknowledge a one-Nigeria prior to a settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> observed that negotiations on issues of such magnitude must proceed slowly and gradually. In his view, the fatal flaw in the past efforts at negotiation had been the absence of careful preparation and planning. He said the Biafrans should recognize the Federal side would be unlikely to agree simply to a meeting of two principals alone. The important point was that all of the negotiations be conducted authoritatively, avoiding any excuse for subsequent renunciation by either side. As for the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, that condition might well be satisfied best by a group of men rather than <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> alone. He thought the Biafrans should broaden their concept of what constituted talk between “principals”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Partial Stand-Down</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> said the issue of the cease-fire was very thorny. What were the prospects of a partial stand-down in the conflict -- for example, a moratorium in the air war, the Biafran order of a unilateral cease-fire along one portion of the front, etc.?</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula said the Biafrans had considered this question and had to reject it as altogether unworkable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The U.S. Position</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Onyegbula asked if U.S. relations with Britain precluded a mediating role for the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> replied that if the U.S. thought it might be helpful as a third party, we would approach that role without a preconception as to the outcome of the war or as to the relative merits of the two sides. The U.S. would seek to be scrupulously impartial. It was true, he said, that there were some U.S. interests in Nigeria, such as investments, etc. But our first concern has been and will continue to be <pb n="4" xml:id="d122-04" facs="d122-04"/>to save lives. <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> said that the Biafrans would have to give the U.S. the benefit of the doubt if it were to play no useful role in the settlement. He said again that he thought it important to steer this conversation away from substantive judgments about the two sides.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Negotiation Procedures</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked how Biafra would envision the role of mediator, whether the talks should be secret or open, whether there was any significance to the date of November 1 which Onyegbula had mentioned in his letter to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>?</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula said a mediator might play a useful role by shuttling between the two sides prior to a face-to-face meeting, but that there was a definite limit to what that could achieve. He said there had to be a decision by both sides on the basic questions -- independence or reintegration, the viability of Nigeria with or without Biafra, etc. Once these major issues had emerged and were resolved, the secondary questions would quickly fall into place. He said there was no special reason for the date of November 1. In fact, “the earlier the better”. But the U.S. had to make up its mind as to what might realistically emerge from the negotiation, what was vital and necessary, and then go for it. He reiterated the point in his letter distinguishing the role of a third party in (a) getting the parties to the table, and (b) serving as a formal mediator during negotiations. He said it would not be necessary for the U.S. to play both of these roles, but Biafra thought that highly desirable. Other governments were unacceptable because of their clear involvement with one side or the other. He said the talks would have to be held in strict secrecy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>
                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked about a possible role for the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> at some stage in a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula said that the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> would be acceptable if it were represented by countries friendly to Biafra as well as those supporting the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. The Consultative Committee of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> had been totally <pb n="5" xml:id="d122-05" facs="d122-05"/>biased for the Federal side. And if normal procedures were followed, the war could go on for several more months before the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> could reconstitute the Committee into a more impartial body acceptable to Biafra. “Why”, Onyegbula asked, “did the U.S. so often promote the role of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> in this problem? ”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> responded that there were two main reasons for this. First, the U.S. did not want to see a settlement imposed from outside; second, any lasting settlement would probably depend upon some kind of role for an external authority, and such a role was best played by the Africans themselves. Finally, the U.S. thought it in everyoneʼs interest to encourage regional responsibility in the developing world. But these concepts were neither a rigid formula nor an abrogation of U.S. interest in Africaʼs future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Security Guarantees</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Onyegbula then said that the central issue was the safety of Biafrans in Federal territory. Those going from Biafra to Nigeria had to be treated in the same manner as Biafrans going to Ghana or the Ivory Coast. He doubted that any external authority -- African or otherwise -- could guarantee this right. Biafra had seceded from Nigeria simply because its only protection was a separate existence. He talked at length of the atrocities in northern Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked if there would also be a problem protecting Ibos in the Midwest and West. Onyegbula said the problem was equally grave throughout Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Other Powers</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked how Biafra saw the role of other powers in a settlement, particularly those that had been directly involved in the conflict such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, the Soviets and the French.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula said the Western world should sort out its own differences on the Nigerian question. The Soviets would undoubtedly try to sabotage any negotiations. The others, however, would have to be brought in at some point. The British were absolutely essential in order to bring around the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d122-06" facs="d122-06"/>
                        <p>Nwokoby interjected at this point that as long as the war continues, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> would have to share his power not only with his commanders but also with his arms suppliers. The end of the fighting would consolidate <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs position, reduce the influence of would-be rivals, and halt the rising influence of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs Position</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked for Onyegbulaʼs personal assessment of <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs position in the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula replied that he had little intelligence about the political situation in Lagos. The Ibos were closer to Americans than they were to the Federals. He said he had great difficulty, in fact, following any line of reasoning or motivation on the other side. He said he could not consider <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to be a man of peace as so many portrayed him. He said he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName>ʼs earlier assertion that it did not matter who represented the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> in the negotiations so long as the negotiators had ultimate authority. He simply could offer no opinion on <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs position, the likelihood of his overthrow, or any other question on which the U.S. might be speculating.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked how relief might relate to peace negotiations, and particularly how the problem of daylight flights might be resolved. Could the U.S. do something to break the impasse on daylight flights?</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula immediately responded that Biafra had agreed to daylight flights, but had been deceived by the Red Cross, which concluded a substantially different agreement with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. He said that nothing in the current U.S. position suggested that we could close the gap between the Biafran position and the Red Cross-Federal agreement. He said Biafraʼs only recourse was to try to expand the night-time airlift.</p>
                        <p>He then stressed that the United States might be helpful if it gave Biafra an “undertaking” that it would do “certain things” if the daylight airlift were violated -- as it probably would be -- by the Federals.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d122-07" facs="d122-07"/>
                        <p>He said Biafra found it incredible that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could write into the agreement with the Red Cross a virtual carte blanche to violate the agreement (a reference to the provision that the airlift would be “without prejudice” to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> military operations).</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> then said he would like to pose a hypothetical question for Onyegbulaʼs consideration. He asked that the Biafrans think about what their reaction would be if the United States were to (a) declare publicly the inviolability of the relief airlift, and (b) offer certain technical arrangements to make that practical. Obviously there was no question of a U.S. “guarantee” or any kind of direct involvement. But the Biafrans had an enormous stake in leaving the door open to an accommodation of public gestures and private arrangements which might actually get the flights started. He stressed, however, that this was only a friendly suggestion; that this was something that might conceivably be discussed at a later point.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula gave an assurance that Biafra would not close this question, and that they would be prepared to look carefully at any proposal of the kind <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> had described. He said specifically, “We would be most anxious to see the wording of such a public declaration.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Shape of the Settlement</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> asked Onyegbula for his views on what practical arrangements might be realistic in reconciling the two sides.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula stressed again the issue of Ibo security. He said there would be a strong aversion among his people even to the name “Nigeria”. It would be a long time before Biafrans would be safe in the rest of Nigeria. However, cooperation could develop in stages, beginning primarily with economic matters. He went into a detailed discussion of possibilities for a common market, common rail lines, the sharing of oil revenues, and trading relations. He said it would be unthinkable for Biafrans to exist economically “apart” from the rest of Nigeria. Biafra was ready to compromise and bargain fairly on the full range of economic relationships with the Federal side. They were also willing to talk about requirements for security, including the question of military and police forces, but that was a much more difficult and complex subject which he did not wish to discuss at this meeting. Herepeated <pb n="8" xml:id="d122-08" facs="d122-08"/>that Biafra was not making their claim to independence a pre-condition to negotiations, and they were ready to have serious discussions with the Federal side on the precise arrangements en-visioned in the Federal concept of one-Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>But Onyegbula stressed that Biafra had not fought a long war with terrible sacrifice simply to return to the status quo ante--and least of all to the bogus arrangements in the Federal 12-state system created during the war. He said Biafra would welcome honest U.S. mediation. But a mediator should be under no illusion that Biafra would negotiate simply as a form of surrender. They were prepared to fight to the death, and to stand alone, rather than deliver their people to the inevitable fate of a one-sided settlement.</p>
                        <p>Onyegbula added, however, that these strong words by no means ruled out genuine compromise. For example, he said, Biafra was perfectly willing to accept an internationally-supervised plebiscite to determine the boundaries of Biafra. He realized the question of minority tribes troubled the United States. He said this was not a problem, that Biafra was confident of winning the allegiance of minority groups in the Southeast and Rivers areas, and that they would accept any outcome of a free vote.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> thanked Onyegbula for his views and said he would convey the content of this conversation to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and the President. In answer to Onyegbulaʼs question about a subsequent talk, <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> replied that we would be in touch with the Biafrans again at some point soon after considering the results of these discussions</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened by expressing his strong personal interest and sympathy with a country he had visited and enjoyed. The U.S. has done what it can in a humanitarian way for Nigeria and was distressed that the problem had not yet been solved.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> had done its best. It appreciates relief that is given but is disturbed by the arms which continue to slip through. Nigerian agreement with the latest <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> proposal is the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs last effort. It hopes that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> can be persuaded to accept. He would do so if he were really interested in his peopleʼs welfare.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d123-02" facs="d123-02"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Minister had seen French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he had tried to but <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> had left. He hopes to see someone in the French delegation soon.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretaryʼs question as to how he saw the future, the Minister replied that the majority of Ibos now believe that the problem must be settled within a Nigerian framework. They know that there will be no genocide. More and more of them are crossing back into Nigeria. In time, the solution will be found in a re-integration of Ibos into Nigerian society. This can come about through negotiations; Nigeria is ready at any time. It can also come about through military means. In either case, Nigeria is not going to change. Many push Nigeria to make further concessions. It will not do so any longer; there is no more give on the Nigerian side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if Nigeria might be raised in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Ambassador Yost said he doubted it although many delegates will mention the problem in their speeches.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he knew there had been unfriendly and critical speeches. He intended to answer them. He had heard that the French were trying to promote an appeal or statement by the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> President or the Secretary General concerning the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he had met Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> several times. He found him a brilliant and sympathetic man. They planned to meet in Washington soon.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have tried to play a useful role, inspired by humanitarian concerns, and have avoided getting involved in political aspects. We are interested in seeing a settlement but not in involvement in the settlement itself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned the question of influence. We are constantly advised not to interfere with other nations. At the same time many of those who so advise us ask us to do something special for them. In Africa we want to be <pb n="3" xml:id="d123-03" facs="d123-03"/>sympathetic and helpful but we do not want people to have the idea that we have hidden motives or desires.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister interjected that Nigeria had used the U.S. constitution as a model for its federal relationship. The Secretary said Balewa had said the same thing but had cautioned that it might not work because of tribal problems in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question, the Foreign Minister said he would go to Washington on the 8th. He hopes to see the Undersecretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and members of Congress interested in Nigeria.</p>

                        <p>Summary: The Nigerians continue to find the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> operation distasteful and the number of C-97ʼs on Sao Tome is not the issue -- the irritant is that these planes are being used in what the Nigerians consider an illegal operation undermining the integrity of a sovereign state. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> and his colleagues made it clear that if the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> had the capability it would get rid of the C-97 problem by shooting them down. They stressed that although these are U. S. planes, <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> is flying them at its own risk.</p>
                        <p>The 90-minute meeting was marked by a frank and candid exchange of views. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> opened the discussion by outlining some of the reasons why the U. S. Government had taken an affirmative decision on <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>ʼs request for additional aircraft.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d124-02" facs="d124-02"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said U. S. concern over the C-97 operation arises from a double problem: (1) the political pressure emanating principally from the churches. The question is whether this pressure can be contained, kept within a humanitarian channel to prevent it from developing into a political lobby which would create an intolerable situation for the U.S. Government, and (2) flight safety. The United States, in its desire to prevent the C-97ʼs from becoming flying coffins, has been urging <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> to adhere to a regular maintenance schedule for the planes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the U.S. Air Force and a private firm in Tel Aviv were the only places where the planes could get the required major overhaul. The Air Force was ruled out, he said, because the United States does not want to become directly involved in the relief operation.</p>
                        <p>The United States has taken the position that there should not be more than four C-97ʼs on Sao Tome, the Ambassador said. Ambassador lyalla told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>: “We donʼt accept this commitment that the U.S. Government is under an obligation to keep four C-97ʼs flying under the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> umbrella.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, again pointing to the political pressures in the U.S. to augment the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> airlift, said provision of the planes to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> might defuse a situation that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> had brought to the attention of U/CF -- a free-swinging Senate debate on the Nigerian civil war.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> recalled that when the U. S. Government initially provided C-97ʼs to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> “we were told the U.S. Government was going to enter into an agreement with the churches regulating the use of the planes.” Also, he said, there was to be U.S. inspection of the manner in which the planes were used. The Nigerian envoy said the churches refused to enter into the agreement and the C-97ʼs have been used to ferry passengers to Biafra who have promoted the politics of the war rather than for relief purposes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> admitted that the inspection procedures had not been worked out, but pointed out that U/CF, on at least three occasions, has discussed the passenger issue-with <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> and had assurances that only <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> personnel would be transported on the relief flights. “They are living up to the agreement,” he commented.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> “is glad to have these assurances,” but added that a blanket statement on passengers “leads us nowhere because the most vocal of Biafraʼs supporters are loosely connected with <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>.” He mentioned, for example, Father <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> and Pastor Middlecoop, calling them more Biafran than the Biafrans.”</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d124-03" facs="d124-03"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>, at this point, participated more actively in the discussion, expressing confidence in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs objectivity and commitment to his assignment. Turning to the question of <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> and the C-97ʼs, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said, “We donʼt like it because it makes things more difficult for the Red Cross to get agreement on daylight flights.” He said once <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> works out an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> on its airlift, “it would not matter how many planes are at their disposal.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, “Why donʼt you take this opportunity now to work on this, to persuade them to accept daylight flights?” But, he acknowledged, whether the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> liked it or not, <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> would get the planes. He also disliked the fact that the C-97ʼs were being maintained “at what is almost a hostile base.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the question of legality probably would result in heated debate at <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>ʼs meeting next week in Stuttgard. He pointed out there is a spectrum of opinion within the loose consortium called <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, and that some elements, unlike <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>-USA, which had a real humanitarian aim, were not wholly impartial.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador lyalla said the U.S. Government has an important lever with <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>. “Without U.S. material support,<gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> would be nothing,” he said.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>ʼs relief coordinating role in Nigeria terminated with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs June 30 policy statement. Any relief agency now can approach the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> directly, he said. He told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>: “Iʼm much more interested in the U.S. Government saying to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, ʼnow that the Federal government has taken over the role of coordinating relief, here is your opportunity to reach agreement with them on your operation.ʼ This interests me much more than being informed about C-97ʼs, which does not help our cause and does not put us in any better position to control what they are carrying or who they are carrying.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baba-Gana said, “We are too weak to retaliate. If Nigeria were in a position to hit back, you would find a law to stop these illegal flights.” He urged the U.S. Government to put maximum pressure on <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> to conform to the new relief arrangement.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d124-04" facs="d124-04"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Iyally said <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> could open preliminary talks on this question with <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> representatives in New York or Geneva “and later they can send people to Lagos.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said he would convey this message immediately to Monsignor Bayer in Rome and <persName corresp="#p_SBEE1">Bishop Swanstrom</persName> in New York, telling them the door is open for negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> on their airlift. But, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> emphasized, “We are not going to do their diplomatic work. They will have to do it on their own.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said if the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could stop the delivery of the C-97ʼs, “we would stop it. If we could shoot down these planes we would do it.” He reiterated that the additional planes will make it more difficult for the Red Cross to get an agreement on daylight flights. “The timing couldnʼt be worse,” he declared.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> interrupted to say, “Our official position is even though you are supplying these planes, <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> is flying them at their own risk.” He said he wanted this point “clearly understood.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> answered, “this is well understood.” He pointed out, however, that interception of a C-9/ by the Nigerian Air Force would have serious political repercussion in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador KOLO brought up the subject of the Cross River talks, saying he understood Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> was not satisfied with the caliber of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> representation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said he had the distinct impression that Dr. Cookey and Mr. Obi had complete authority to commit Biafra to a reasonable plan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador KOLO said he doubted this, in fact, he added, this was the reason he did not personally participate in the two rounds of talks in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the inspection issue was the big hang-up, but that “our feeling is we want to push these talks to a conclusion, one way or the other. I hope to see the talks resumed this month.”</p>
                        <p>On the inspection issue, Ambassador KOLO said “we must understand the ball is now in their court. This is a purely <pb n="5" xml:id="d124-05" facs="d124-05"/>legal right we have.” He said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> should query the Biafrans again on the inspection point.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said the Biafrans saw inspection as a symbolic political issue. Mintioning the Biafran call for third party guarantees, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said there are no sanctions we can impose. We certainly are not going to get to relief in.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> returned to the C-97 issue, saying “I would like to reiterate that whatever the views, timing is very important. Nothing should be done while the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is trying to get agreement on daylight flights.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baba-Gana supported this statement, declaring “It is very important for negotiations between the rebels and the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> to succeed.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador KOLO criticized what he called the encouragement being given the illegal <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> operation and said “everything must be done to strengthen Navilleʼs hand.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>With Bill Brubeckʼs conversation with Houphouet, we can begin to see at least the murky outline of a new diplomatic episode in the Nigerian civil war. It is not clear yet whether we have been kept in the dark through inadvertence or conscious design. But I feel strongly that we should move right away to try to establish some vital precision in the initiative, largely to protect ourselves from precisely the kind of ambivalence that overtook our policy on the daylight flight agreement. In short, we have an interest in correcting the sloppiness which could lead again, to a situation in which the US (and the Biafrans), on a close study of the equities, would not be able to endorse an apparently forthcoming position taken by Gowen. Specifically:</p>
                        <p>1. Because the Red Cross did some fast shuffling on major provisions of the daylight flight agreement (and because no-one caught them up in the process), we were faced with an agreement for which Gowan expended valuable capital in his own government, yet to which the Biafrans could still pose legitimate objections. The result is that we have neither daylight flights nor a clear field to fix the blame. If someone had ferreted out, and then thought through, the important discrepancies -- the question of inviolability, the air route. the right of call-down, etc. -- we would have saved both lives and energy. As it is now, the Feds are locked in, and weʼre going to have to make a major push with both sides before we can honestly say that we did our best. Thus my statement. the Canadian initiative, black boxes, etc.</p>
                        <p>I see exactly the same problem developing with the new <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> initiative. So far, the components of that action appear as follows:</p>
                        <p>-- Cease fire: An appeal from <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> to Gowen to offer unilaterally a cease-fire for a temporary period in order to get talks started. Apparently, Cowan would <pb n="2" xml:id="d125-02" facs="d125-02"/>do this on the understanding that (a) it would entail a legitimate stand-down in arms supply as well as ground fighting and (b) the Feds would have the right to police the cessation of arms flights into Biafra.</p>
                        <p>-- No pre-conditions: According to Houphouet (<gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> didnʼt mention this point), Cowan is also to offer talks without pre-conditions, which would be a major concession following the obvious battle he has been having with his hawks at Addis and afterward.</p>
                        <p>--The <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> role: Tanzanians and Ivorians are involved. But the initiative is also clearly stamped with the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> in the presence of Diallo Telli. No-one seems to be looking ahead at the precise questions of (a) auspices for these talks, (b) third parties, if any, at the table or otherwise, and (c) matter, of agenda, context, relationship to <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Resolution, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. On this basis, it may well be that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> could get his people to make the offer, calculating, that it would be just as shrewd and politically profitable (albeit unproductive) as the daylight flight agreement. But <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> will have an easy escape -- and we will be mired in our usual dilemma -- unless someone beforehand answers the following questions:</p>
                        <p>--Does the arms stand-down also apply to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>? If so, who polices them?</p>
                        <p>-- How does the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> police the skies while <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is given safe passage out to the talks?</p>
                        <p>-- Who verifies the cease-fire, and how?</p>
                        <p>-- If Nigerian unity is not a pre-condition, does this mean the negotiations are not under the latest <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution?</p>
                        <p>--If this is under <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> auspices, is it a warm-over of the Concom, or something new? Is the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> prepared to change the Concom, if necessary, to include friends of Biafra?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d125-03" facs="d125-03"/>
                        <p>--What if Addis or Monrovia are unacceptable to Biafra?</p>
                        <p>--Is Biafra being given a chance to react before a Fed pronouncement?</p>
                        <p>--Are all strings of negotiation being coordinated by someone?</p>
                        <p>-- What role are the British and French playing?</p>
                        <p>-- Does this have any relationship to relief? (Houphouet foresees “month”; a lot of kids are going to die during the “preliminaries”)</p>
                        <p>We have certainly learned two lessons by now: (1) Africans generally are slipshod in their peace initiatives, however well-intentioned. (2) the Biafrans are not; on the contrary, they probe the scenario with great care. Knowing, as we do so well, Ojukwoʼs standard objections to the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, a unilateral concession on arms supply, etc., we can readily expect a hard (and justifiable) Biafran rejection of the plot as we now know it.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, we may discover these bases are covered as we find out more about the action. (I very much doubt it.) But if they arenʼt, anyone who really wants the action to work (not to mention keeping the US unscathed) should flush out the answers.</p>
                        <p>I am persuaded, as you know, that there is no virtue (only some pain) in letting these things “take their course”. The comfort of non-involvement is illusive when our absence may only mean the war drags on.</p>

                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ Meeting with the President October 6 -- African Topics</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>My sources at State tell me the Secretary may raise both Nigeria and the Rhodesian Consulate. The following brings you up to date on each, including <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ talks at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and positions he may be pushing:</p>
                        <p>Nigeria-Biafra</p>
                        <p>-- Bilateral Talks at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> saw about 20 African Ministers. (The main reporting cables, with key passages underlined, are at Tab A.) His constant refrain on Nigeria was that we were generous with relief but wouldnʼt touch the political problems. The rationale for this line, as it came through in various talks, was either that: (a) others were already involved in peace-seeking, or (b) a US mediating role would be difficult and open to criticism.</p>
                        <p>African reaction to this tack ranged from acceptance to indifference to pique. Most of the Africans, of course, still publicly support an <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> solution. But <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had at least three feelers for a US move (Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Tanzania) which he summarily turned off. The Ethiopians, among others, reported to <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> this weekend that they were confused by the Secretaryʼs position following the Presidentʼs more activist approach with the Emperor last spring. (<persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> tells me privately that some Africans -- and probably the French -- now suspect weʼre playing a double game, which has advantages, of course, as well as draw-backs.</p>
                        <p>-- Developments in the War. The fighting is still stalemated, with Biafran probes back into the fallen capital of Umuahia and very close to Port Harcourt. The arms supply is as high as ever.</p>
                        <p>There are the vague outlines, however, of two new factors: (1) Trying to retrieve the failure of the recent <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Summit, <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> has launched yet another initiative to get the sides to start talks during a 2-week cease-fire. Heʼs leaning on <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d126-02" facs="d126-02"/>and Biafraʼs friends -- Houphouet and Nyerere. There are even initial reports that the date for the cease-fire has been set. But the Feds have been adamantly against a cease-fire and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> distrusts the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. ([text not declassified] suggests Biafra has scotched this gambit.) Like other African initiatives, this one begins with a flourish and is likely to end with a zero; (2) There are growing hints of a coup against <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, probably by Northern hawks frustrated by the stalemate. Iʼll have a full intelligence report for you sometime today. But you should know the rumblings are there. The implications are: (a) it puts a premium on getting the war settled to preserve a relatively moderate regime in Lagos, (b) it tends to weaken the already limping war effort in Nigeria; watching each other, they scarcely have time to apply themselves to a quick victory, and (c) it could give <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> greater incentive to negotiate, if the talks were serious and not simply a ploy.</p>
                        <p>--Stateʼs Line. The Secretary may argue that the Africans heartily support our hands-off policy, and they have their own promising initiative in any case. The hard fact is that there are serious doubts about both these points. Or initiative need not rule out an African role, and we should move quickly to do everything we can to get talks started. A hawkish coup in Lagos will only bring us to the logical end of Stateʼs policy -- both greater suffering in Biafra and alienation of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Rhodesia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary may mount a new push for withdrawal of the Consulate. State is arguing that we are suffering a major loss with the Africans at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> took two distinct approaches on Rhodesia at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. To some he justified the post on protection grounds and struck almost a take-it-or-leave-it tough line. To others (including the Brits) he promised withdrawal when Salisbury declares a Republic.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the African reaction was surprisingly mixed between criticism and resignation (this latter reaction included Tanzania!).</p>
                        <p>In my view, there has been nothing thus far in New York to justify appealing the Presidentʼs decision -- particularly before the full <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review of Southern Africa coming up in the next few weeks. (Rhodesian references in attached cables are underlined in blue.)</p>

                        <p>Our present course emphasizes relief. We are also probing for opportunities to stimulate mediation efforts and talks between the belligerents.</p>
                        <p>RELIEF:</p>
                        <p>Night flights by Joint Church Aid (<gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>) and the French Red Cross, both illegal in Nigerian eyes, continue to be Biafraʼs sole relief channel. Last week we delivered two additional C-97 aircraft to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> over strong Nigerian objections. The bulk of the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>ʼs air lift is provided by C-97s which are flown by American volunteers.</p>
                        <p>The impasse over the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight flight proposals continues. We have repeatedly emphasized to the Biafrans that we consider the current <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> proposal, already accepted by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, to be a reasonable one. (As a by-product, agreement might permit legalization of the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> flights.) The Biafrans continue to claim that day-light flights without third country guarantees would endanger their security. To meet this concern, we are encouraging the Canadians to offer observers who could report any violations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs face-to-face discussions with the parties in Geneva have recessed without obtaining an agreement on the Cross River route. However, the seasonal drop in the water level will drastically reduce the capacity of this route until February.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d127-02" facs="d127-02"/>
                        <p>The prospects for achieving agreement on relief arrangements are not good. For both sides and for other Africans relief is clearly secondary to political considerations. Biafran political objectives are served better by parallel French and American-supported illegal relief operations than by agreed daylight flights. At the same time it is not clear how long the political situation in Lagos would permit a legal air-lift to continue. Nevertheless, the sympathy of the Western world requires continuing efforts on our part to achieve effective relief arrangements.</p>
                        <p>PEACE:</p>
                        <p>Peace remains the only ultimate answer. The military situation is stalemated and no break is in sight. Each side is acquiring additional arms. Serious escalation, particularly in the air, is possible. There are also signs of possible internal dissension with the Nigerian military.</p>
                        <p>In the wake of last monthʼs <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> meeting a major initiative by the Emperor of Ethiopia, supported by President Nyerere, is currently underway. In that connection President Houphouet-Boigny has just told us that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has suggested an October 17 meeting for peace talks at Monrovia or Addis Ababa without preconditions and with a temporary cease fire. Houphouet-Boigny has endorsed the proposal and is trying to persuade <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> to agree. Nyerere, during his forthcoming trip to the Soviet Union, intends to discuss possibilities for an arms embargo. (A recent Special National Intelligence Estimate sees little hope for an effective arms embargo.)</p>
                        <p>An earlier Papal peace effort which we stimulated through the Emperor, and which involved a Vatican emissary to 0jukwu, has not as yet produced any visible results, but Papal interest continues.</p>
                        <p>We have been following and, where possible, encouraging all reasonable peace efforts. We have not <pb n="3" xml:id="d127-03" facs="d127-03"/>taken a public role in the belief that it would probably be counter-productive. We feel that it is through contacts with both sides and their supporters that we can most effectively contribute at this stage to peace efforts. However, the basic positions of the two sides remain far apart. There is no evidence as yet that either is prepared to make the concessions required for meaningful negotiations. The Africans still hope to solve the problem themselves, while an objective of Biafran diplomacy is to involve the United States. We have expanded our discussions with key governments in Africa and Europe (particularly the French) where our persuasion, properly timed, might be helpful. William Brubeck, head of the Special Staff for Nigeria, is currently completing a three week tour of these capitals.</p>
                        <p>In this country Congressional and public interest has declined. American opinion generally has become increasingly aware of the complexities of the situation. A relatively small but influential group continues to press for greater U.S. involvement. The black community largely supports the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>FURTHER STEPS:</p>
                        <p>1. Continuing diplomatic efforts in support of legal relief arrangements.</p>
                        <p>2. A further Presidential statement in support of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight flight proposal may be desirable shortly, after the status of the Canadian observer initiative clarifies.</p>
                        <p>3. If these efforts fail, increased support to the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> night airlift to ensure a more adequate flow of supplies. However, we should discourage the use of additional American crews.</p>
                        <p>4. Continued recognition of Nigeria as well as open lines to the Biafrans so as to maintain a degree of confidence on both sides. This would enable us to <pb n="4" xml:id="d127-04" facs="d127-04"/>play a role in encouraging the acceptance of a peace plan at the proper moment. Avoidance of exclusive support for any particular solution.</p>
                        <p>5. Close and continuing contact with key European and African capitals.</p>

                        <p>Held at a luncheon at the Residence of the Nigerian Ambassador on Sunday, October 12, 1969, 1:00-4:00 p.m.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Biafran Weakness</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> opened by saying that the Biafrans were torn by dissension among their leadership and widespread popular disaffection with the war. A Nigerian victory was imminent.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> for his views on prospects in the civil war, and particularly how he explained reports of high morale inside Biafra.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said that Biafran morale was an illusion. Ibo villages were extremely parochial and thus indifferent even to the civil war taking place a few miles away. That tribal isolation, rather than support for <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, explained the seeming tranquillity in Biafra. The Biafran elite was almost entirely expatriate, in the sense of cultural identity with the resident Ibos in the East. These were foreign-mannered opportunists returned to mislead a hapless and unsophisticated people on a wild political adventure.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d128-02" facs="d128-02"/>
                        <p>I replied that I would not quarrel with <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> on this point. But if his view were correct, the Biafrans were putting up a very impressive front. That kind of ingenuity -- if not genuine popular support for secession -- presented Lagos with a formidable challenge.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">US Relief Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> then launched into a lengthy (and standard) list of US transgressions in the civil war -- our frequent public condemnations of the Federal side (e.g., on the Red Cross plane shoot-down), our failure to supply arms or even diplomatic support, our tolerance of Biafran propaganda, our willful flaunting of Nigerian sovereignty in support of the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> flights, etc. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said the Presidentʼs letters to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> were supposedly written by a friend. But the United States continued to act as all but an enemy. Nigeria understood that we had a domestic political problem on the relief issue, but that they expected the Administration to lead rather than follow on this issue. The equities so clearly lay with a friendly government trying to put down a cynical rebellion dangerous to the whole Continent.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the United States understood very clearly the paradox in a policy which continued friendly relations with Federal Nigeria, yet generously contributed to feeding the rebels and thus, in a sense, the rebellion. But I would not bore the Foreign Minister with another explanation of the humanitarian impulse which had brought us to this dilemma. It was the simple fact that the United States was pledged -- as an expression of the Presidentʼs deep personal concern, as well as domestic opinion -- to do all we could to help relieve the suffering of innocent civilians on both sides of the battle. Our diplomacy would make every effort, as we had thus far, to resolve the conflict between that genuine concern and our friendship with the Federal Government. We did not think the two elements need be irreconcilable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">
                                <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>-French Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I then asked <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> how long Nigeria would go on saying harsh words to the United States on the relief issue when Lagos refused to lay a glove on the French for a less ambiguous, and more lethal, contribution to the other side. <pb n="3" xml:id="d128-03" facs="d128-03"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> replied that Nigeria would “have our pound of flesh” from the French sooner or later. But they were frankly concerned that a move now might invite some kind of French intervention. They had no idea what form this intervention might take, but any greater French involvement would prolong the war. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> had therefore refrained from any action against Paris.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Interdiction of Uli</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> when the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would acquire an interdiction capability to close off the arms flights into Uli. I asked specifically why the British had not given them some help in this respect.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said the problem was both logistical and political. The Nigerian Air Force had neither sufficient aircraft nor trained pilots. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, for his own parliamentary reasons, had shrunk from providing anything more than small arms or “defensive” weapons, and ruled out jet aircraft. As a result, the Soviets were the only aircraft suppliers, and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> had decided not to request the kind of “help” from Moscow that they might have asked of Britian.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">
                                <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> Attitudes and <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs Position</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> that if often seemed to us -- in reading conflicting statements or in hearing divergent views in official conversations -- that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> might be blessed like all good governments with an aviary of hawks and doves. I asked for his comment on that, especially if he thought General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs position was stronger or weaker than it had been six months ago.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said he would be candid. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> often stood alone against the Executive Council on foreign policy questions. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> had decided to accept the Red Cross agreement on daylight flights by personal fiat. An actual vote in the Executive Council would have gone heavily against him. But in most cases, <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> added, the Ministry of External Affairs backed <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs more moderate posture towards the relief operation and the powers which supported it.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d128-04" facs="d128-04"/>
                        <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs position, <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said simply that a coup dʼ etat could “never be ruled out” in a military regime. But he thought <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs personal integrity -- and especially the absence of a large tribal constituency which had made him an acceptable compromise to begin with -- left <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> “the strongest man in Nigeria”.</p>
                        <p>Baba Gana interjected at this point that the debate over the Red Cross daylight flights had indeed been heated. He asked when the United States was going to give the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> some public credit for making this generous concession.</p>
                        <p>I replied to Baba Gana that we understood the utility of encouraging a moderate position on relief. The United States had made repeated and vigorous efforts to negotiate an expansion of relief into Biafra, and some of those efforts had, of course, led to misunderstandings with Lagos. We were not prepared to accept public blame from any quarter for the continuing relief impasse. We were still hopeful that daylight flight arrangements might be salvaged to the benefit of Lagos as well as Washington. For that reason, we had refrained from making any statement that might complicate any efforts to resolve the problem. But the time was surely coming, I said, when it would be necessary to establish clearly the position of both sides.</p>
                        <p>Baba Gana said the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> agreed that there might still be some hope for daylight flights, but the US must be prepared to call the rebels to account for their refusal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Possible US Role</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>, said he appreciated the frankness of this exchange, and, therefore, wanted to raise the most important question of his trip to Washington. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> had often reflected, he said, that the US had no real interest in Nigeria. Thus it was futile to expect any positive help from us. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said he had argued with the General that the US did have a considerable interest in the unity of Nigeria. And if we did, we should be willing to take a hand in preserving that interest.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d128-05" facs="d128-05"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> wondered specifically if the US would be willing to tell the French that the time had come to end this dangerous civil war. There was no question of a “Biafran rebellion”; this was quite simply an adventure conceived and sustained from the Elysee Palace. The French were the key to everything. If President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is truly interested in ending the suffering and fighting, the US would go to the French, make our own position clear on the preservation of Nigeria -- and then offer, in effect, to act as a go-between among Paris and Lagos to help the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> find out “the necessary price”. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> was prepared, <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> said, to examine “whatʼs the deal”.</p>
                        <p>I replied that this was a very complicated and sensitive matter which the United States would have to think over with some care. As <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> well knew, we had no desire to impose -- or even seem to be imposing -- a great-power settlement on an African civil war. But we were convinced that the earliest end to the fighting was in everyoneʼs interest. I hoped <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> would explore this question further with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> the following week.</p>

                            <item>Meeting with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> of Nigeria Today, 4:00 pm</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Hereʼs where we stand on Nigeria/Biafra, including our own initiatives:</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> “decided” on Saturday to proceed with the relief initiatives the President previously instructed. Weʼll approach the Biafrans with (a) a Presidential statement to accommodate their position on inviolability of the Red Cross daylight flights; (b) the Canadian neutral observers; and (c) some communications help. The object is to lock in the Feds on their pledge not to violate the airlift, and thus meet Biafran objections to daylight flights.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> also “decided” to get moving on peace probing. But he recognizes Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> (like <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>) is against a political initiative, and E.R. is undertaking to bring the Secretary around this week. (Incidentally, E.R. was most cordial to me).</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> got from <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> yesterday a renewed assurance that the Feds would not violate a daylight Red Cross airlift. He told <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> about our relief initiative only in vague terms -- that we were “getting in touch with the Biafrans to clarify their position on daylight flights”.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> put out a feeler with me Sunday on the US acting as a go-between among the French and the Feds on ending the war. (My memcon, underlined, is attached.) This was an important overture from the Feds. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> raised it again with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, but was told we simply wouldnʼt get in the middle.</p>
                        <p>Talking Points</p>
                        <p>I recommend you let <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> do most of the talking. Ask him:</p>
                        <p>1. Are the Federals prepared to negotiate seriously? What are they ready to do, and what do they want from Biafra, to get productive talks started?</p>
                        <p>2. The President is personally concerned that the fighting and suffering end as soon as possible. How can the US actively help? (If he mentions our going to the French, we should leave the door open <pb n="2" xml:id="d129-02" facs="d129-02"/>If asked about our relief moves:)</p>
                        <p>3. We are in contact with the Biafrans to nail down the obstacles to daylight flights. Weʼre still hopeful the airlift can go.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As I reported to you last week, <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> is moving ahead on the relief initiative (as instructed by the President) to try to break the impasse on daylight flights. On October 19 we gave our “understanding” to the Biafrans as to the inviolability of the airlift. Their answer is due tomorrow. I am satisfied that State has pursued this much of the Presidentʼs instructions with precision and vigor.</p>
                        <p>I am still very concerned, however, about the low-key way they are going about a six-week-old Presidential instruction to mount a serious peace probe. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> seems to have the message from you. He has decided to deal with the delicate problem of bringing around the Secretary by having <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> send a memo to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> which <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> will endorse on its way in.</p>
                        <p>Yet it has taken two weeks just to get a draft of that memo (bootleg copy at Tab A). Not only does it contain <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>ʼs usual distortions of fact, but also -- in making a watered-down probe subject to prior Federal acceptance -- it directly contravenes the Presidentʼs instructions to pursue an even-handed and vigorous initiative.</p>
                        <p>It may be, of course, that <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> will correct these major flaws as the memo comes through him. But if he doesnʼt, we face exactly the same situation Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> brought to San Clemente on the Nigerian problem. That is, State “is agreeing” to launch an initiative as the President desires, but in a manner and toward a goal directly opposite to the Presidentʼs intentions.</p>
                        <p>Having all too recently encountered <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>ʼs wrath, I have every desire to give him the benefit of the doubt in this issue. And in keeping with your instructions to us to be tactful in such matters, I have not given him the specific Terms of Reference which you signed on this matter on October 2.</p>
                        <p>I would like your authorization, though, to have a quiet session with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> to: (a) bring him in on the <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Norman Cousins</persName> initiative and our follow-up, and (b) suggest the importance (both for success <pb n="2" xml:id="d130-02" facs="d130-02"/>and consistency with the Presidentʼs wishes) of an even-handed and flexible probe. I would still not hand him the Terms of Reference, but rather use them as talking points” to illustrate what I understand from you to be the Presidentʼs preferred approach. All, to be sure, with tact. As a refresher, the <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> documents are at Tab B.</p>
                        <p>This action takes on greater urgency, of course, with each day of mounting starvation (and thus greater rigidity of position) in Biafra. (I am sending you separately a complete up-dating on Biafra for the President, including an analysis of major problems we face over the next two-three months.)</p>
                        <p>Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>That you authorize me to see <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> to discuss past actions (<persName corresp="#p_CN3">Norman Cousins</persName>) and terms of a future US peace initiative.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Following your decision that we should undertake exploratory soundings on the Nigerian problem before considering further steps, Mr. Brubeck has now completed four weeks of talks in Europe and Africa. His findings, together with other current evidence, were reviewed on October 10 by the African Interdepartmental Group. Its conclusions and recommendations are summarized below.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are engaged in a follow-up of your statement of September 9 in a last effort to impel Biafran acceptance of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight relief flights. All evidence suggests that the Biafrans remain determined to prevent these flights, using the need for third-party guarantees as their ostensible reason. The only chance we see of persuading them to agree is to make the political cost of refusal too high. They are under considerable external pressure to accept and, in the hope it may be decisive, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> is making one final USG effort in support of current <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> negotiations with the Biafrans. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> has approached the Biafrans with the offer of a Presidential statement that the USG “under-stands and accepts” the Nigerian undertaking not to violate the agreement for military advantage. This is as far as we can go to meet the Biafran demand for third-party guarantees (their other demands are probably negotiable). <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> has asked for a “yes or no” response, warning that if the Biafrans reject what we consider a reasonable agreement, the USG would feel free to make public its view on the merits of the Biafran position. We are advising the Nigerians, <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, the French and the British of this initiative, and have requested the support of Ivory Coast President Houphouet-Boigny (as the closest supporter of the Biafrans). We are now awaiting the Biafran response.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Assessment of Situation</p>
                        <p>The situation remains essentially as summarized in your memorandum of October 6 to the President. Barring a negotiated settlement, the war could drag on indefinitely, certainly for the next six months. Neither side seems under sufficient pressure to make the concessions necessary for compromise. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> insists on acceptance of “one Nigeria” and the beginning of “serious” negotiations before a ceasefire. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> insists on unconditional negotiations accompanied by a ceasefire., African efforts have generally concentrated on an all-or-nothing negotiation of the basic issues at the summit. These efforts seem to us as well as other observers to have suffered from inept preparation and handling. The latest such effort at mediation, by <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Secretary General Telli with the Emperorʼs sponsorship, has foundered. Our information suggests Telli was presenting different terms for negotiation to the two sides.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, there are some possibly encouraging new elements in the situation.</p>
                        <p>(a) Both <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> have indicated their readiness for confidential, lower-level exploratory talks, but there has been no systematic effort to exploit this avenue as a way around the present impasse. Yet the occasional, limited contacts that we know of, as well as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs Cross River talks and the sporadic, often conflicting-exchanges taking place now through various African third and even fourth parties make us think that exploratory talks are possible.</p>
                        <p>(b) Among the Africans the flurry of recent negotiating initiatives, though ill-prepared and often at cross-purposes, shows a mounting concern to end the war. Even the committed supporters of the two sides are urging the need for compromise and the need for outside support for African mediation.</p>
                        <p>(c) Although their “asking prices” are irreconcilable both sides have enough problems and could be brought enough pressure to justify a try at a skillful exploratory mediation. while it is not our place to speculate on the terms of settlement, we believe a basis for exploratory discussions exists.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d130-05" facs="d130-05"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Outside Involvement</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We continue to feel that a direct US mediating role is unwise and that we should confine ourselves to private, diplomatic support for African mediation efforts. We recognize, however, that as the war drags on and public US humanitarian concern persists, our deep commitment to a relief effort carries its own dangers of deeper involuntary political involvement.</p>
                        <p>Several governments have raised with us the question of a US role in the current impasse. The role envisaged has been primarily an approach to one or the other of the Europeans involved. The Nigerian Foreign Minister has urged us to speak to the French. Houphouet and Nyerere have urged us to speak to the British. This kind of a US role, which might lead to our stimulation and support of non-American mediation would mean greater involvement. The question is whether the situation has now altered sufficiently and the prospects for progress increased to the point where a behind-the-scenes effort at the request of and in support of the Africans would be feasible and would have a chance of effective results. We now feel on the basis of our recent discussions with other countries that circumstances have changed and that we can and should now undertake this type of effort. Since the only real solution to the relief problem is peace, such a role might carry less risk than our present, in effect open-ended commitment to relief.</p>
                        <p>Among the non-involved Europeans (Scandinavians, Dutch, Germans, Italians) the situation is much like ours. Their domestic political pressures are contained by their commitment to humanitarian relief. At the same time, they are remarkably alike in realistically assessing the need for a compromise. If some promising mediation were in prospect, they would probably join with the US and others in lending what diplomatic influence they have (though none wants to get out in front).</p>
                        <p>The key Europeans directly involved, the British and French, are uneasy, probably looking for some avenue to compromise, but have real interests and commitments to the two sides. Their cooperation will depend on finding an approach that they can honorably and gracefully support. They are beginning to realize the need to come to some mutual understanding to end the war. Pompidou told Ambassador Soames recently that the French would be willing to pressure Ujukwu for a settlement if the British would do so with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. While the Soviets are also involved, they are unlikely to cooperate and we of course would not count on their help.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Conclusions and Recommendations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d130-06" facs="d130-06"/>
                        <p>We conclude that:</p>
                        <p>(a) The present international climate for negotiated settlement is probably as favorable as can be hoped for in the foreseeable future. Given the alternative (protracted war perpetuating the relief problem with its attendant political dangers) an effort to exploit the present climate for negotiations is worthwhile.</p>
                        <p>(b) What is needed, and has so far been lacking, is a systematic and coordinated effort under African auspices with widest African and outside support. It should begin with what is possible--a lower-level, confidential, exploratory mediation sponsored by key Africans on both sides (especially the Emperor and Houphouet); should be conducted by a skilled and discreet African mediator; should have the diplomatic support of the non-involved outsiders (US and European); and would require some prior understanding between the British and French as the basis for their support. It should begin with a carefully prepared agenda starting with modest, exploratory questions and avoiding the basic issues, should aim initially only at getting a dialogue going.</p>
                        <p>We have considered carefully how the US might help in promoting such an enterprise, while avoiding a direct role and direct responsibility. Balancing our view that this is not primarily a US concern against the possibly useful role the US can play, we have concluded that, at least, some further exploration along these lines is warranted.</p>
                        <p>The following recommendations are admittedly limited and may not produce results; but we believe they provide the most useful contribution the US can make without risk of over-involvement:</p>
                        <p>1. That we continue the pattern of intensive consultation with interested European and African governments begun with Brubeckʼs trip. We should express a willingness to work closely with them in support of a promising African mediation effort, and seek to develop further a basis of mutual trust and understanding, and a potential consensus for concerted diplomatic support of such a mediation.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d130-07" facs="d130-07"/>
                        <p>2. That we explore with governments more directly involved (particularly France, Britain, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia) the prospects for a low-key pre-negotiation negotiation; who might be an effective mediator; African sponsorship and scenario for such a mediation; and how far outside governments (particularly the French and British, but with the cooperation of ourselves and other Europeans) might lend diplomatic support to the mediatorʼs efforts.</p>
                        <p>3. If a suitable mediator could be agreed upon, under the auspices of some key African governments, we and other outside governments should be prepared, privately and confidentially, to consult with him and support his efforts with the two sides. The US would not assume the mediatorʼs role, would act only in consultation with other outside governments, but would be prepared to take an active part, with these governments, in the effort to develop and support a negotiating initiative.</p>
                        <p>4. That before beginning this further round of explorations, we explain our views and role to the Nigerian Government, and proceed only to the extent that they understand our limited, indirect participation and regard it as helpful.</p>

                        <p>REPLY TO THE GUARANTEE FORMULA PROPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <p>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BIAFRA HAS CONSIDERED THE GUARANTEE FORMULA WHICH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO OFFER WITH REGARD TO DAYLIGHT RELIEF FLIGHTS. THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO EXPRESS ITS APPRECIATION FOR THIS GESTURE BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH IS IN THE TRUE HUMANITARIAN TRADITION OF THE UNITED STATES AND IN ACCORD WITH THE POLICY OF NEUTRALITY WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BIAFRA AND NIGERIA. HOWEVER, THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS IN THE LIGHT OF WHICH IT FINDS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCEPT THE GUARANTEE FORMULA:</p>
                        <p>1. THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO POINT OUT THAT SINCE THE SHOOTING DOWN BY THE NIGERIAN AIR FORCE OF AN I.C.R.C. RELIEF PLANE ON JUNE 5, THE QUANTITY OF RELIEF REACHING BIAFRA HAS BEEN HALVED. WHILE THE JOINT CHURCH AID HAS BEEN FLYING IN RELIEF SUPPLIES AT NIGHT AS USUAL THE I.C.R.C. HAS CEASED OPERATION AND HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS AIMED AT OPENING DAYLIGHT FLIGHTS. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE ACTION OF NIGERIA IN SHOOTING DOWN A RED CROSS PLANE IN DAYLIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY CONDEMNED AND EFFORTS DIRECTED AT RESTORING THE STATUS QUO ANTE. THE ACTION OF STOPPING THE FLIGHT ENTIRELY CANNOT BUT BE REGARDED AS AN ATTEMPT TO CONDONE NIGERIAʼS CRIME AND ENCOURAGE HER TO MORE ACTS OF LAWLESSNESS.</p>
                        <p>2. BIAFRA HAD ALWAYS INSISTED THAT IN ORDER TO OPEN ULI AIRPORT, HER ONLY LINK WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, TO DAYLIGHT FLIGHTS WHICH WOULD EXPOSE THE AIRPORT TO EFFECTIVE ATTACK BY NIGERIA SHE MUST HAVE GUARANTEES FROM A THIRD PARTY GOVERNMENT OR AN INTERNATIONAL BODY OF A POLITICAL CHARACTER. THIS REQUEST HAS BEEN MADE BECAUSE OF A BASIC LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE GOOD FAITH OF THE NIGERIAN REGIME - A LACK OF CONFIDENCE ARISING <pb n="2" xml:id="d132-02" facs="d132-02"/>FROM SUCH INCIDENTS AS (A) THE SEIZURE OF THE UTURU (OBLIGAGU) RELIEF AIR-FIELD, (B) THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER OF EXPATRIATE AND BIAFRAN RELIEF WORKERS AT OKIGWI AND (C) THE DELIBERATE BOMBING OF HOSPITALS AND SICK-BAYS MARKED WITH THE RED CROSS SIGN. SUCH A GUARANTEE, OF COURSE, MUST CARRY CREDIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST NIGERIA IF IT IS TO BE A DETERRENT. UNDERSTANDABLY, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE I.C.R.C. TO OBTAIN SUCH A GUARANTEE TO COVER ITS OPERATIONS. BIAFRA, HOWEVER, IS BEING INSISTENTLY PRESSED TO PERMIT DAY-LIGHT RELIEF FLIGHTS MERELY ON THE BASIS OF ASSURANCES GIVEN BY THE NIGERIAN REGIME.</p>
                        <p>3. AT THE DISCUSSION IN LIBREVILLE ON SUNDAY, OCTOBER 19TH 1969, BETWEEN SIR LOUIS MBANEFO AND AMBASSADOR FERGUSON IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS EXCELLENCY, THE PRESIDENT OF GABON, THE POINT WAS MADE THAT SINCE THE CONTENTION OF NIGERIA WAS THAT I.C.R.C. PLANES CARRIED ARMS INTO BIAFRA, THE PROPOSAL FOR INSPECTION BY A NEUTRAL BODY AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF NIGERIA WOULD HAVE ALLAYED FURTHER FEARS. AMBASSADOR FERGUSON REPLIED THAT NIGEGNA NO LONGER PRETENDED THAT THESE RELIEF PLANES CARRIED ARMS. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY ARGUED THAT THESE PLANES PROVIDED A COVER FOR THE ARMS FLOWN IN FOR THE DEFENCE OF BIAFRA. FROM THIS IT FOLLOWED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEPARATE THE RELIEF FROM THE ARMS PLANES. IT IS CLEAR, THEREFORE, THAT THE ISSUES OF RELIEF AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF BIAFRA ARE INEXTRICABLY INTERWOVEN. IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRESENT ATTITUDE OF NIGERIA IT MUST NOW BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE QUESTION OF GUARANTEES FOR DAY-LIGHT RELIEF FLIGHTS HAS CEASED TO BE RELEVANT.</p>
                        <p>4. HERE IT MUST BE RECALLED THAT NIGERIA IMPORTS LARGE QUANTITIES OF ARMS WITH WHICH SHE IS WAGING A VICIOUS WAR AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF BIAFRA. AT THE. SAME TIME SHE RECEIVES MASSIVE RELIEF SUPPLIES FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. IT HAS NEVER BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THESE RELIEF SUPPLIES MUST BE SEPARATED FROM THE ARMS SHIPMENTS NOR HAS THE MEANS OF ACHIEVING THIS BEEN DISCUSSED. INDEED, NEARLY A THOUSAND VEHICLES HAVE BEEN IMPORTED BY RELIEF ORGANISATIONS INTO NIGERIA AND THESE HAVE BEEN PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION AS TO THEIR USE. IF BIAFRA ACCEPTS DAYLIGHT FLIGHTS AS PROPOSED SHE WOULD BE LAYING HERSELF OPEN FOR DESTRUCTION IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY RECEIVE RELIEF.</p>
                        <p>5. THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO MAXIMISE THE EXISTING FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR BRINGING RELIEF INTO BIAFRA WHICH DOES NOT ENDANGER THE SECURITY OF BIAFRA OR OFFER OVERWHELMING MILITARY ABLANTAGE TO NIGERIA. SECONDLY, SINCE IT SEEMS THAT THE I.C.R.C. NOW FINDS ITSELF BOUND BY CERTAIN LEGAL AND POLITICAL DISABILITIES FROM FLYING RELIEF BY NIGHT NO OTHER ORGANISATIONS OR AGENCIES THAT ARE NOT BOUND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO OPERATE RELIEF FLIGHTS INTO BIAFRA TO SUSTAIN THE I.C.R.C OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d132-03" facs="d132-03"/>
                        <p>6. FINALLY, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PEACE-LOVING NATIONS OR HUMANITARIAN ORGANISATIONS, SHOULD APPEAL FOR A TRUCE ON LAND AND IN THE AIR LASTING EVEN FOR ONE WEEK DURING WHICH RELIEF CAN BE BROUGHT IN ON A MASSIVE SCALE TO THE SUFFERING PEOPLE OF BIAFRA.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN GOVERNMENT WISHES TO EXPRESS ITS GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND EOPLE OF THE U.S. FOR THE VERY CONSIDERABLE AID THEY HAVE GIVEN TO RELIEF OPERATIONS IN BIAFRA.</p>

                        <p>The following may be useful in giving you more precision with regard to your request this morning. I have also added a third problem -- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs penchant for putting the President on the spot with unfriendly members of Congress, including some formal testimony which completely ignored instructions given when the testimony was cleared by the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
                        <p>1. Instructions to <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> Not to Talk to Me</p>
                        <p>You will remember that this followed the incident at San Clemente in August, in which (a) Tony telephoned a Presidential decision on Nigeria (which went against State) while I was in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs office, (b) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> got the word to Okun before I got hold of Ted Elliot, and (c) the Secretary was disturbed that he was “informed” of the White House decision by one of his Assistant Secretaries. The prompt result was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> was summoned by the Secretary and told that <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> should strictly limit consultation with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff, and on no account discuss “policy moves or decisions” which State was making or planning to make. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> then called me to his office to tell me of this order. He said the Bureau would like to continue to have the “benefit” of my views, but they were not at liberty to tell me how they would use this or what they were going to recommend on a given policy problem. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said he was getting out an instruction to his Bureau (which several officers later confirmed) forbidding the transmission of any informal memoranda, conversations on State policy positions, etc. with me. All communications on policy, he said, would come through the Seventh Floor.</p>
                        <p>All this has made my job somewhat less easy, but scarcely impossible. We still get some cables to clear, still have the IG mechanism, and I do flush out <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> from time to time despite his guarded tones. The most unfortunate result, from my point of view, is that officers in the Bureau under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> are typically and understandably running scared about contacts with me. And some very good, honest relationships built up <pb n="2" xml:id="d133-02" facs="d133-02"/>carefully over the past few months have been put in the deep freeze by some FSOs who have been told, in effect, that I am beyond the pale.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">NSSM Paper on Southern Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You will recall here again that this was a case of introducing a new option in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper at the <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> meeting, with neither prior circulation nor even notice. Suffice it to say that this simply would not have happened under Joe Palmer, who had major differences with me on policy issues, but was scrupulously above board (as I was with him). As you well know, this new option was a combination of (a) a long-standing effort to wreck the Review Group, (b) <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>ʼs lack of intellectual courage in presenting their own position as directly as the IG had agreed in the original NSSM paper, and (c) an effort by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> to cut me out by getting an endorsement at the table from FLAK.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs Public Statements</p>
                        <p>Attached are memcons and a copy of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs recent testimony before the House Subcommittee on Africa. They tell our “friend”, Congressman Diggs,the following:</p>
                        <p>-- State recommended the closing of the Salisbury Consulate (read “weʼre on your side, Mr. Congressman”). The decision now rests with the White House (read “if it stays open youʼll know who to blame”).</p>
                        <p>-- State thinks importing Rhodesian chrome would be (a) against the law, and (b) a violation of our international obligations to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (read again, “weʼre OK”). But the decision is still pending (read again, “if the chrome comes in, youʼll know who violated domestic and international law”).</p>
                        <p>-- US policy is to (a) seek majority rule of Rhodesia, (b) tighten up sanctions, and (c) formally regard Rhodesia as a threat to the peace.</p>
                        <p>-- The Department of State “points out broader foreign policy aspects” of Southern Africa, but they also have to deal with “representatives of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff” (read “which explains why some things go wrong”).</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d133-03" facs="d133-03"/>
                        <p>All these instances, documented in the attached, seem to me rather bald violations of the security of the decision-making process. It is none of Diggsʼ business where a controversial decision rests in the US Government. It is not <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs place, in the midst of a policy review in which the President must have free choice, to “explain” to the opposition in Congress the position of the Department of State on the major issues before the bureaucracy. The result of these conversations can only be that, if the President chooses a different course from that recommended by State, Diggs and his colleagues will know that their friends in State fought the good fight against the wrong-headed White House.</p>
                        <p>I could add to this, of course, (though it is scarcely comparable) that I have been treated to the same medicine for my efforts to get a range of choices in the IG paper on Southern Africa. Some weeks ago, I had lunch with a local academic who asked me, with astonishing accuracy and detail, to explain to him the views I had been voicing at inter-agency meetings. In the same vein, I was told by a highly confidential source that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> frequently took my name in vain in briefing Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> prior to the <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> meeting. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> apparently told him, “does not share our views” on the basic issue of the racial question. I add this last, Al, only for illustration and not at all for attribution, since if the story got back the source could quickly be identified and his career would be in jeopardy.</p>

                        <p rend="center">PROPOSED PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON RELIEF IN NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR</p>
                        <p>I must report with deepest regret a serious setback to a vigorous and concerted international effort to expand the flow of relief to the suffering civilian victims of the Nigerian Civil War.</p>
                        <p>As I pledged shortly after taking office, this Government has dedicated both generous contributions and extraordinary diplomatic activity to relieve the human anguish and suffering in this tragic conflict. It was in this spirit that we supported the recent proposal of the International Committee of the Red Cross for a program of daylight relief flights into Biafran-held territory. Such flights would have allowed the resumption of Red Cross relief which had been suspended since June 30 when the Federal Military Government of Nigeria, because of the scrambling at night of arms flights and relief flights, declared that it would no longer permit night flights across its territory.</p>
                        <p>On September 13 the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> concluded an agreement with the Government of Nigeria allowing an internationally-inspected and militarily-inviolable relief airlift during <pb n="3" xml:id="d134-03" facs="d134-03"/>daylight hours for an experimental period with the prospect of renewal. The Biafran authorities refused, however, to accept such flights--principally on the grounds that they could not rely on either the Red Cross or the Federal Government to assure that the daylight airlift would not be violated by a surprise attack on the Biafran airfield, the vital terminus for their arms supply. They asked instead that they be given third-party assurances as to the good faith of the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>To meet this concern, the Government of the United States at my direction took the following steps:</p>
                        <p>(1) We sought and received the solemn assurance of the Federal Government of Nigeria that it would see to it that no hostile military action would be taken against the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> relief air-lift.</p>
                        <p>(2) After consultation with us, the Government of Canada agreed to offer Canadian soldiers as impartial observers to accompany <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> aircraft on their relief flights.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d134-04" facs="d134-04"/>
                        <p>(3) Our relief coordinator, Ambassador C. Clyde Ferguson, went personally to West Africa to give the Biafrans the specific assurance of the United States that we accepted as made in good faith the solemn pledge of the Government of Nigeria as to the in-violability of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight relief flights.</p>
                        <p>On October 24, 1969, the Biafran authorities formally rejected this assurance.</p>
                        <p>The result is tragic. We firmly believe that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> proposal is realistic and reasonable. We consider that the Federal Military Government of Nigeria, in agreeing to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> proposal, acted in full accord with its humanitarian responsibilities. We believe that the integrity of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, the safeguards incorporated in the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> relief program, and the assurances of the United States Government should adequately satisfy the legitimate security concerns of the Biafran authorities.</p>

                            <item>Late Developments Affecting a Presidential Statement on Biafra.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A is a statement (relevant points underlined) made this morning by <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> accusing the US of “maneuvers” on the relief issue which only helped the Feds and British against Biafra. The story got some play in todayʼs Washington Post. This is a predictably tough and defensive effort to pre-empt what <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> undoubtedly anticipates as a major blast from us on the failure of our daylight flight initiative. (The Biafrans obviously expect what they call the “State Department hawks” to carry the day now within the USG).</p>
                        <p>I think this alters somewhat the recommendation I gave you yesterday (copy at Tab C) against a statement blaming the Biafrans for the failure of daylight flights. Now that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has chosen to make a public issue of our role, it may make sense to get on the record at least an explanation of those “maneuvers”. But there remain good arguments - in terms of poisoning the atmosphere on both relief and political initiatives - against a harsh statement from the President personally.</p>
                        <p>An alternative would have <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> deliver a version of this statement when he meets the press following his talks with Foreign Secretary Stewart this weekend. He could cast the statement as an explanation in response to the <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> charges, and keep it an even-tempered recital of our efforts to accommodate rather than pressure the Biafrans on this issue. (A proposed <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> statement, a revision of the original State draft, is at Tab B.)</p>
                        <p>State and <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, of course, will be more anxious than ever to have a strong condemnation in the light of the <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> statement. And ER will find it much less satisfactory to issue the statement himself just because he wants to disabuse the Biafrans of the idea (not unperceptive) that they enjoy some sympathy from the President. Yet it is precisely the preservation of that idea -- that the US is still capable of dealing fairly -- that argues against a strong Presidential blast.</p>
                        <p>Even with a <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> statement, however, I think we can and should go ahead with a nice message to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, as proposed in yesterdayʼs memo.</p>

                        <p>EASTERN NIGERIA SECESSIONIST RADIO IN ENGLISH 0600 GMT 6 NOV 69 N</p>
                        <p>(TEXT) GEN ODUMEGWU OJUKWU HAS REITERATED BIAFRAʼS STAND ON RELIEF. BIAFRA, HE SAID, WOULD LIKE TO GET RELIEF BUT THIS MUST COME IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO JEOPARDIZE HER SECURITY. BIAFRA HAS ACCEPTED A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS TO FACILITATE THE SUPPLY OF RELIEF, BUT LAGOS IN TURN HAS TURNED THEM DOWN IN KEEPING WITH HER POLICY OF USING STARVATION AS A WEAPON OF WAR. HE SAID THE LATEST AGREEMENT BETEEN LAGOS AND THE <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> FOR DAYLIGHT FLIGHTS SOUGHT TO NEUTRALIZE BIAFRAʼS USE 0F ULI AIRPORT AND ALLOWED NIGERIA FLEXIBILITY IN ITS USE, THUS EXPOSING BIAFRAʼS SECURITY TO DANGER.</p>
                        <p>GENERAL OJUKWU SAID THE ENTIRE CONFUSION OVER RELIEF IS DUE LARGELY TO THE MANEUVERS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. HE ACCUSED THIS GOVERNMENT OF HELPING NIGERIA AND BRITAIN TO NEUTRALIZE THE BIAFRA AIR POTENTIAL. HE THOUGHT THE UNITED STATES, BEING A POWERFUL NATION, SHOULD HAVE INTERVENED ONLY ON THE SIDE OF PEACE BY BRINGING PRESSURE ON LAGOS TO GO TO THE CONFERENCE TABLE. BUT, INSTEAD OF USING ITSELF FOR PEACE, IT IS INCREASINGLY INVOLVING ITSELF ON THE SIDE OF NIGERIA DIPLOMATICALLY.</p>
                        <p>ON THE ROLE OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, GENERAL OJKUWU OBSERVED THAT IT HAS A STAKE IN THE WAR. ITS MAIN AIM IS TO EXPLOIT THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF BIAFRA FOREVER. FOR IT, ANY POSITION WHICH SATISFIES THIS AIM IS ACCEPTABLE.</p>
                        <p>HE SAID HE DOES NOT THINK THE SEVERANCE OF CONNECTIONS WITH THE <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> WILL SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE. THE FAULT IS NOT THAT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO RUN THE ORGANIZATION. RATHER IT IS THE DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN THE INTERNATIONAL POSTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION. HE THOUGHT THAT THE RED CROSS WAS IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE IT WANTS TO GIVE SUCCOR TO ARE DYING.</p>
                        <p>THE HEAD OF STATE SAID IF THE RED CROSS HAS FAILED BIAFRA IN RECENT TIMES IT IS IN ITS FAILURE TO FIND AN INTERIM SOLUTION. IN THIS REGARD, HE WONDERED WHETHER IT IS NOT MORE REASONABLE FOR CIRC TO PASS SOME RELIEF STOCKS TO SOME RELIEF AGENCIES WHICH ARE NOT IN THE SAME DIFFICULTY AS IT IS, WHILE TRYING TO FIND A LONG-TERM SOLUTION.</p>
                        <p>GENERAL OJUKWU EXPRESSED THE PEOPLEʼS APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS OF RELIEF AGENCIES TO ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERING. HE SAID THE EFFECT OF THE STOPPAGE OF RED CROSS FLIGHTS HAS BEEN A CUT IN THE QUANTITY OF RELIEF COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, BUT BIAFRANS HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT TO HELP THEMSELVES TO REDUCE THE MORE DRAMATIC EFFECTS IT WOULD HAVE HAD. GENERAL OJUKWU SAID HE HAS FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF THE BIAFRANS TO SURVIVE ANY DIFFIULTY.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you instructed, we have been moving along two lines in dealing with the Biafran problem: (1) an initiative to break the current relief impasse on Red Cross daytime flights, and (2) probing the possibilities for negotiating a settlement of the war itself.</p>
                        <p>The following summarizes where we stand on these initiatives, with Stateʼs recommendation on the next step.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You will recall that the impasse on daylight flights stemmed from the Biafran fear of a Federal violation of the airlift for a sneak attack on the airfield which is Biafraʼs sole lifeline for arms and food. This long-standing fear remained despite the Federalsʼ general pledge to the Red Cross that they would refrain from attacking the airfield during the day.</p>
                        <p>The Biafrans approached us through a private intermediary about four weeks ago asking that the US provide some “guarantee” that Nigeria would not abuse the daylight night route. There was no question ” and the Biafrans seemed to understand this - of our direct involvement in policing the airlift. But we did seize the opportunity to offer them (a) a Presidential statement that we took the inviolability of the airlift as a solemn commitment of the Federal side, and (b) help in getting both communications equipment and Canadian observers as practical safeguards.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> received a commitment on the inviolability of the airlift from the Nigerian Foreign Minister when he was here recently. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName>, our Relief Coordinator, then carried our offer to West Africa to lay it before the Biafrans.</p>
                        <p>What followed among <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> and his colleagues is not clear. Our intelligence [text not declassified] suggests a major wrangle in the Biafran leadership between their Foreign Ministry, whose people had floated the initiative with us in the first place, and the Biafran military. In any case, over the last two weeks it has become clear that the military has prevailed and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has turned down our initiative.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d135-06" facs="d135-06"/>
                        <p>There were probably two main grounds for the rejection: (1) increasing use of the Biafran airfield by their mini-air force during daylight hours, which the agreement would have prohibited, and (2) a predictably hard-nosed conclusion by <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> that not even a U.S. assurance and the threat of our opprobrium, short of military intervention, would deter the Federal mercenary pilots from trying a sneak attack that could have a decisive effect by severing Biafraʼs arms supply. There is also the consideration, real or imagined, that night relief flights provide some cover for arms flights. A daytime agreement would probably have tempted the religious relief agencies to give up their hazardous night runs for the safer Red Cross route.</p>
                        <p>In the face of this rejection, State is now recommending that you issue a statement revealing the secret initiative and condemning the Biafran refusal. Their proposed statement is at Tab A. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> argues that the statement is needed to (1) protect our standing with the Federals, who claim that we have never given them due credit or the Biafrans due scorn on relief, and (2) generally to show the Biafrans that we mean business when we go out of our way to meet their position. State believes (and I think with some justification) that <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has exploited relief for political advantage. They want to get his “intransigence” on the record.</p>
                        <p>The other side of the argument, however, is that a public condemnation of the Biafrans at this point is unlikely to force any change in their position. It might only harden the already deep distrust and cynicism which lie behind their rejection. These are people who see, themselves, rightly or wrongly, as having gone it alone in a noble cause against great odds. Their strong point ” a fierce pride and independence ” is precisely what makes them tough to deal with. A public slap from you, adding to their sense of isolation, could damage whatever chance we may still have to play a useful role in trying to get a relief arrangement.</p>
                        <p>It can also be argued that a statement of this kind might reawaken the domestic debate in the Congress and elsewhere. Our critics have been muted largely by the knowledge that we are sticking with the problem in an even-handed way, despite the frustration.</p>
                        <p>There is, moreover, an important consideration on the timing of this statement in relation to our efforts on the political side to probe the prospects of a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Political</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The last few weeks have seen another flurry of African diplomatic activity with <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> and various parties trying to bring the two sides together.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d135-07" facs="d135-07"/>
                        <p>The Africans made clear that they wanted no outside help on these efforts.Thus, we stood on the sidelines, knowing little of the backstage moves but trying to give them every chance to succeed. It is now obvious, however, that these African efforts have failed again -- apparently for the usual reasons of poor coordination and absence of real levervage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> feels -- and I agree -- that the way is clear now for us to move ahead on the peace probe you authorized earlier. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> plans to begin, while heʼs in Europe for the NATO sub-Ministerial, with an approach to the British and French this weekend.</p>
                        <p>The question is whether a Presidential condemnation of Biafra on the relief problem helps or harms this political initiative. State argues that a hard line on relief tells the Biafrans they canʼt take advantage of us in a peace effort. But a stubborn Biafran counter-reaction of the kind described above could poison the atmosphere on political as well as relief matter. Our peace probe will not go very far if <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> and his wary advisers believe we are looking for the first opportunity to tag them with public exposure.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that Stateʼs proposed statement raises more problems than it solves. I agree with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> that we need some gesture with the Federals to keep them cooperative in both relief and political matters. But that could be done with a brief message from you to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> (proposed draft at Tab B) which praises his agreement to daylight flights without a public branding of the Biafrans.</p>
                        <p>At some stage -- either as a counter to domestic critics or a tactic in negotiations -- we may well have to reveal the record and assess the blame in the Biafran problem. But a statement now seems to me premature -- and perhaps harmful to our beginning effort to spur a negotiated settlement. I think we have to expect a lot of frustration -- and endure it quietly -- if we hope to make a dent in this bitter and complex problem.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation</p>
                        <p>That you approve the message to General Gowan (Tab B) instead of the proposed statement on Biafraʼs rejection of our reiief initiative (Tab A).</p>
                        <p>Approve —— Disapprove——_ See me———</p>

                        <p>Following is pour memoire on our tel con just completed:</p>
                        <p>1. As regards proposed Presidential statement condemning Biafrans for failure our relief initiative, I understand that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> is against such statement. Am told he argues (a) undesirable have President admit failure in public, (b) statement unnecessary in light low-level domestic concern, and (c) statement merely another step in undesirable involvement in problem. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> said to feel strongly, however, that statement necessary both to appease Federals and pre-empt domestic critics, particularly in light recent <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> speech, which Secretary may not have seen. In any case, my proposal for <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> rather than Presidential statement is strictly internal staff. State continues to assume issue is yes or no on Presidential statement as they submitted it.</p>
                        <p>2. Regarding political probe, <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> had received Secretaryʼs approval last weekend on memorandum recommending peace probe along lines discussed <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in accord Presidentʼs decision of September 12. You will recall that, for tactical reasons, Secretary never given directly Presidentʼs September 12 decision, and matter left for <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> to handle internally at State. Secretary now reportedly concerned, despite his prior approval <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>ʼs recommendations, that we are becoming “involved” in political matters.</p>
                        <p>3. Operational consequences this turn-around:</p>
                        <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> to see British and French, but with diluted brief of no significance in pushing forward probe;</p>
                        <p>(b) State overnight cancelled <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> meeting with Biafran number two man in London this weekend, at which we were to make serious high-level probe vital questions of Biafran negotiating position. Bureaucratically, despite Watts -<persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> directive of September 9 specifically asking White House clearance all Nigerian policy cables (and Colorado Springs directive), these operational instructions to <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> went out without, repeat without, White House clearance.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Nigeria]</p>
                        <p>-- Red Cross Ceases Direct Relief to Biafra: Red Cross officials told us privately in Geneva over the weekend that an extraordinary session of the International Committee had decided to (a) give up its futile four-month effort to negotiate a daylight flight agreement acceptable to both sides and (b) cease direct operational relief flights rather than resume a nighttime airlift in the face of Nigerian objections. As a practical matter, this means that the International Committee will now channel its funds, foodstocks and equipment (including US-donated aircraft) through various national Red Cross agencies -- such as the French and the Scandinavian -- which are willing to fly at night despite the risk of Federal attack.</p>
                        <p>Red Cross resources will probably also go to support the religious voluntary agencies flying from the isle of Sao Tome. However, the distribution of Red Cross resources and the duration of its support for these other agencies is not yet clear. In terms of relief, the actual diversion and use of now dormant money and airplanes could increase substantially the present nighttime operations from Sao Tome and neighboring Libreville (which is also the main source of French arms supply).</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d138-03" facs="d138-03"/>
                        <p>The implications for the US are: (a) the loss of a prestigious and neutral international presence for the actual operation of any relief arrangement we might have negotiated, and (b) an almost inevitable run-in with the Federals if US-supplied cargo planes turn up, as they well may, in support of French relief operations which the Federals suspect of gunrunning. Continued US support for Biafran relief will now have to be given solely to a hazardous nighttime airlift which Federal Nigeria regards as a violation of its sovereignty.</p>

                        <p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE FOR THE PRESS <lb/>NO. 339</p>
                        <p rend="center">STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">WILLIAM P. ROGERS</persName> ON BlAFRAN RELIEF</p>
                        <p>Over the past nine months this Administration has made a major effort to help relieve the anguish and suffering of civilian victims of the Nigerian civil war. A further report on our efforts is in order.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning of this tragic event the United States has sought to support and insure an effective means of delivering relief to the sufferers on both sides.</p>
                        <p>Some of the steps this Government has taken include the appointment of a high-level Coordinator of all United States activities relating to Nigerian/Biafran relief, Ambassador C. Clyde Ferguson; the donation of over $65 million to the international relief effort; and sustained diplomatic efforts, both bilaterally and in concert with other concerned Governments, to obtain agreement on expanded international relief arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, relief into Biafran-held territory remains tragically inadequate.</p>
                        <p>Relief supplies now reach the Biafran enclave only at night, in insufficient amounts, by aircraft across Federally controlled territory lacking the approval of the Federal Government and originating outside Federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, following the shooting down of one of its aircraft on June 5, the International Committee of the Red Cross suspended its night flight operations which had provided roughly <pb n="2" xml:id="d139-02" facs="d139-02"/>one half of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> flights have remained suspended since that time in view of the Federal Governmentʼs reiteration on June 30 that it could no longer permit such night flights across its territory. One major consideration cited by the Federal authorities was the intermingling at night of arms flights and relief flights into the enclave. The present arrangements for getting relief into the enclave are considered by the agencies involved to be both dangerous and inefficient.</p>
                        <p>In recent weeks, the United States has vigorously supported efforts of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> to obtain agreement by both sides on a program of daylight relief flights.</p>
                        <p>On September 13, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, after extensive diplomatic efforts, concluded an agreement with the Government of Nigeria allowing an internationally-inspected and militarily-inviolable relief airlift during daylight hours for an experimental period with good prospects for renewal. The Biafran authorities, however, have refused to accept such flights--principally on the grounds that they believed they could not rely on either the Red Cross or the Federal Government to assure that the daylight airlift would not be violated by a surprise attack on the Biafran airfield, the vital terminus for their arms supply. They asked instead that they be given third party assurances as to the good faith of the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>To meet this concern, at President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>ʼs direction, we took the following initiatives designed to facilitate agreement on a safe and effective method of getting relief into the enclave:</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d139-03" facs="d139-03"/>
                        <p>(1) We sought and received the solemn assurance of the Federal Government of Nigeria that it would ensure that no hostile military action would be taken against the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> relief aircraft.</p>
                        <p>(2) After consultations with us, other governments agreed to offer impartial observers to accompany <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> aircraft on their relief flights.</p>
                        <p>(3) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> went to West Africa to give the Biafrans the specific pledge-of the Federal Government of Nigeria as to the inviolability of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight relief flights.</p>
                        <p>On October 24, 1969, the Biafran authorities formally rejected this assurance.</p>
                        <p>On October 31, the Biafrans publicly announced their acceptance of an earlier U.S. plan for a surface route utilizing the Cross River in Eastern Nigeria. Under this proposal relief supplies would be delivered by ship to a mutually agreed neutralized distribution point. We have stated our willingness to resume discussions on this.</p>
                        <p>In our view however this Cross River route cannot substitute for the immediate resumption of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight flights. Even if the plan could be promptly implemented the capacity of the river route will be greatly reduced by a low water level for several more months. The agreement of the two sides to this plan is so far in principle only and there has been no meeting of minds on the specifics of inspection and guarantees. Nevertheless, our Relief Coordinator is continuing his efforts to bring about agreement on the Cross River proposal.</p>
                        <p>Daylight flights under agreed procedures therefore remain the only practicable scheme for an immediate and substantial expansion of relief operations.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> proposal is such a realistic and reasonable scheme. We consider that the Federal Government, in agreeing to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d139-04" facs="d139-04"/>proposal, has acted constructively and in accordance with its humanitarian responsibilities. We also believe that the proposed arrangements for daylight flights meet in a reasonable manner the legitimate security concerns of the Biafran authorities.</p>
                        <p>Innocent civilians are in desperate need of food and medical supplies. The United States stands ready to continue its aid to these helpless victims of the Nigerian war. We earnestly hope that the Biafran leadership will reconsider its position regarding daylight flights.</p>
                        <p>Beyond these immediate measures, however, we clearly recognize that the ultimate solution to the problem of relief is an end to the war. The suffering and the fighting have gone on too long. As President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has said, the United States earnestly hopes for the earliest negotiated end to the conflict and a settlement that will assure the security and peaceful development of all the people involved.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As the President instructed, State is now preparing recommendations on further steps in the relief effort following the Biafran rejection of our recent initiative and the decision by the Red Cross to bow out of a direct operational role. Their position will probably boil down to (a) continued financial support for a nighttime airlift while (b) trying to lower the American profile (in planes and volunteer crews) to lessen the risk of a Federal shoot-down and the resulting diplomatic confrontation with Lagos. The paper is due at the opening of business Monday.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, on the political front, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> did use his European trip to broach a joint US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French effort to spur peace negotiations, Londonʼs reaction was warm, and they are ready to start talking details at staff level. The Quai was more coy, but <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Schumann</persName> obviously has to consult the Elysee before responding. Once the French make up their minds, they too will probably keep the initiative alive.</p>
                        <p>Some time within the next two weeks, therefore, we will have to decide on the next step with both the British and the French. That will bring us to concrete issues such as the form of mediation, what we expect:London to say to Lagos, Paris to tell the Biafrans, etc.</p>
                        <p>Having begun this process, however, we now find ourselves at an impasse within the US Government. The Secretary of State -- though he had signed off earlier on a <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> recommendation to carry out the peace probe -- has now decided on further thought that he is strenuously against any US political role to try to settle the war.</p>
                        <p>The result is that the machinery in State has come to a standstill. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> has been reprimanded by the Secretary for both relief and peace moves, and probably fears any further US initiatives will cost him his job. (The Secretary reportedly told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> this morning that we should be glad the Biafrans rejected our relief initiative, since he ((Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>)) would have had to order the repudiation of our offer in any case).</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d140-02" facs="d140-02"/>
                        <p>We are, in short, stuck out on a limb in implementing the Presidentʼs September 9 decision, and specifically in following through with approaches already made (and presumably authorized) to the British and the French.</p>
                        <p>I see three alternatives:</p>
                        <p>(1) A written directive to State on the Presidentʼs decision to follow an even-handed and active probe of the negotiating possibilities;</p>
                        <p>(2) Yet another effort through <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> to persuade the Secretary to take this course; or</p>
                        <p>(3) A direct discussion between you and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>.</p>
                        <p>My own judgment is that a written directive is no substitute in this case for a direct talk between Principals. And I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, who has already tried in vain to sell the Secretary in a low-key, can be expected to take up another try. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>ʼs staff tells me that they will encourage him to try to clear the air, but he is in a delicate position to say the least.</p>
                        <p>I see only one clear remedy for this problem -- that is for you to sort it out directly with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation. That you discuss our policy toward Nigeria/Biafra with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> in order to arrive at operational coordination consistent with the Presidentʼs policy.</p>
                        <p>Iʼll talk to Secretary; draft talking points ———<lb/>Prepare written directive ——<lb/>Iʼll handle with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> [checkmark here]<lb/>Speak to me ———</p>

                            <item>NIGERIA-BIAFRA: New Weapons May Delay Peace Talks</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Biafra has received new aircraft that will extend significantly the striking range of its air force. Nigeria in turn has new long-range guns that increase its chances of destroying the principal Biafran airfield. Both sides probably will intensify their military activity to exploit these new weapons. While they are doing so, there will be less desire by either to undertake serious peace talks.</p>
                        <p>Planes for Biafra. Since May 1969 the Biafran air force has been carrying out attacks on Nigerian targets, particularly oil installations, with its Swedish-designed, single engine, “Minicon” aircraft, of which it presently has 11. Although these attacks have not altered the military balance, they have led to a decrease in Nigerian petroleum production, and shown Nigeriaʼs vulnerability to offensive air action. In early November 1969 Biafra took delivery of two T-6 aircraft. North American Aviation, Incorporated, built over 15,000 of these planes during World War II for use as trainers. The Biafran models, which may have been acquired from the French, are fitted with weapon mounts for combat. Their normal operating range is about 870 miles. Five more Biafran T-6ʼs are in various stages of readiness outside the enclave. In addition, one British-built Gloster Meteor jet fighter is believed to be in Bissau, Portuguese Guinea, awaiting delivery to a point from which it can be used against Nigeria.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d141-02" facs="d141-02"/>
                        <p>Guns for Nigeria. Nigeria has received 24 Soviet-made 122 mm field pieces having a range of 13 miles. Some of them are assembled, and Nigerian crews are being trained. If the Nigerians can bring these guns close enough to targets in Biafra, they might be able to do more damage with them than they have with the 20-25 Soviet jet air craft that they now have in operating condition.</p>
                        <p>New Offensives for Both. Biafra apparently has already used its T-6ʼs in action against Port Harcourt. If they are able to keep them flying, the Biafran authorities will almost certainly use these aircraft to attack Nigerian airfields. Oil installations, many of which are beyond the range of the “Minicons”, will also be targets. Every target of military significance in Nigeria is within range of the T-ʼs, including Lagos. Biafran authorities have threatened to bomb civilian targets in retaliation against Nigerian Air Force raids.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Military Government is supposedly preparing an offensive intended to put its new field guns within range of the principal Biafran airport of Uli. The Federal First Division has as its objectives Nnewi, to the north of Uli, and Orlu, to the east. The Third Divisionʼs objective is Oguta to the south. These three points are all within 13 miles of Uli. Biafran attacks on the southern front might delay the Third Divisionʼs offensive. (See map.)</p>
                        <p>The Nigerian Air Force will probably give priority to the destruction of the T-6ʼs. If they fail in this effort, as they have in their attempts to snoot down the “Minicons”, they might in frustration endeavor to destroy another unauthorized relief plane.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d141-03" facs="d141-03"/>
                        <p>Negotiation Prospects Unchanged. Continuing and determined efforts by several nations are under way to bring the belligerents to the negotiating table, but it is not likely that either side will negotiate seriously until it is hurt sufficiently to force concessions or loses confidence in its longer range military position.</p>

                        <p>Under heavy pressure from friends and would-be mediators, Nigeria and Biafra seem finally to have agreed to second level talks, to be held under the aegis of Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> when Ramadan ends after December 12. Much, however, could happen to upset this fragile understanding. Even if negotiations do take place, the parties are still too far apart to permit much hope of agreement. A military “solution,” sooner or later, remains the most likely prospect.</p>

                        <p>Negotiating Positions. The Nigerians are holding firm to their “one Nigeria” policy, though they may be flexible as to when and in what form the renunciation of secession takes place. The Biafrans, while publicly holding to their demand for a separate existence--particularly for representation on international bodies and for autonomous security forces--may have a fall-back position allowing for some concessions. Reuters recently quoted an unnamed Biafran spokesman as saying: “Since our attachment to sovereignty is functional and not sentimental, Biafra will be prepared to accept, at the suggestion of no matter whom, any alternative arrangement that can guarantee a nonrecurrence of the massacres of the last 25 years.” The statement has since been denied, although it is thought to have been made or approved by Colonel <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">C. Odumegwu Ojukwu</persName> himself in an effort to signal Biafran flexibility. “Flexible” or not, the Biafrans still seem quite disinclined to make the sort of basic concessions the federal side demands.</p>
                        <p>The Alternative to Negotiations. The alternative to negotiations is continued civil war. Both sides have received new weapons which could have sudden impact in either direction.(1) However, recent travelers to the enclave report that discipline and morale among the Biafran troops has deteriorated. Platoon commanders are said to be commandeering relief vehicles and stealing civilian crops for their men. Visitors report that many Biafrans seem to express their support for the war only if asked, and otherwise keep quiet.</p>
                        <p>(1) See Intelligence Note 811, “NIGERIA-BIAFRA: New Weapons May Delay Peace Talks,” November 14, 1969</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d142-03" facs="d142-03"/>
                        <p>We understand that Biafran finances are in bad shape and that Biafran forces now operate on ammunition reserves more limited than before. These straws in the wind may indicate a situation in which the Nigerians would lose all interest in negotiations as they sense imminent victory on the battlefield. Ironically, the very circumstances which could lead Biafra to make the required concessions tend to stiffen the Nigerian back.</p>
                        <p>How the End May Come. Due in part to lack of effective leadership the Federal military has consistently failed to overrun the enclave. Nevertheless, Federal troops are only 20-25 miles from the two principal Biafran air-fields and less than ten from field artillery range of these essential life-lines to the outside world. There are indications of expanding Federal military activity. While Federal and Biafran forces are about equal in number in the South, there are areas in the North where the Federal forces enjoy a two or three-to-one edge; they have a considerable edge in firepower. The Biafran lines are stretched thin, and a penetration of perhaps 10-15 miles by Nigerian forces could bring about a Biafran collapse. So might the capture or interdiction of Uli airport for more than a few days.</p>
                        <p>Pieces Instead of Peace: Federal troops could lose self-control in a retaliatory blood bath as they occupy a prostrate Biafra, especially if Biafra in desperation takes some rash last-minute action such as bombing Lagos. The Federal Chief of State, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">YAKUBU GOWON</persName>, and his division commanders do not want such atrocities, but their ability to control the troops at the platoon level is uncertain. The situation could be aggravated by Biafran guerrilla resistance. There is an observer team composed of two observers <pb n="4" xml:id="d142-04" facs="d142-04"/>from each of six countries; they are normally in Lagos. So small an international “force” could not be expected to exercise much restraint on Federal troops sweeping the enclave should organized resistance cave in. Such a tragic breakdown in Federal discipline is by no means inevitable, but the possibility must be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>After the Flood: There would be an immediate need for food, medicine and shelter in areas over-run by Federal troops, even if Federal discipline holds firm. This requires pre-positioning of major stocks of supplies and drawing up of contingency agreements among air line companies, relief organizations, and governments. The more effective the international assistance rendered in the wake of a rebel collapse, the better would be the hope for peaceful reintegration of the Ibos into Nigeria. A prostrate Biafra presents a sombre prospect, but this seems the likely outcome in the absence of a negotiated settlement. The attrition of fatigue, military pressure and malnutrition continues to weaken the resiliency of Biafra. A collapse could come in a week, a month, or the better part of a year.</p>

                            <item>Nigerian/Biafran Relief Discussion</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>A complete impasse has been reached on moving relief into Biafra by daylight airlift. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> airlift is no longer operating and night flights by <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, the French Red Cross and Africa Concern, all considered illegal by the FMC, are delivering supplies at only half the peak level reached last May.</p>
                        <p>Present arrangements for getting relief into the enclave are considered by the agencies involved to be both dangerous and inefficient. Prospects for resumption of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> relief flights seem remote, given the Biafrans apparent determination to permit relief flights only at night as cover for the arms airlift. Although both sides have agreed “in principle” on the Cross River surface route, it is doubtful either side is in fact willing to implement the project. Further, the Cross River proposal is not a substitute for relief flights in the near term since the present low water level would limit the amount of relief that could be provided Biafra by this means over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>Relief into Biafran-held territory thus remains wholly inadequate and the nutritional situation continues to be grave, particularly in the areas away from the zone served by the paved arteries such as the Orlu-Owerri road. Recent samplings by the medical member of a survey team from the office of your Special Coordinator for Nigerian Relief, <pb n="2" xml:id="d143-02" facs="d143-02"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, reveal that 42 percent of the children are suffering from edema and 52 percent of the adult population. Nearly 100 percent of the people in the bush suffer in Varying degrees from malnutrition.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Basic Options</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to our future policy on Nigerian relief, we have considered four basic courses of action:</p>
                        <p>(1) Withdrawal from the Nigerian/Biafran relief effort coupled with the publication of a White Paper on our efforts as justification. In our judgment, from the domestic standpoint and our obligation to the international community, this is not realistic.</p>
                        <p>(2) Maintain the present level of our support and involvement, that is financial contributions to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> on their present scale. This course would result in some domestic criticism for inadequacy, but would put increased pressure on others (e.g., the French Red Cross and Africa Concern, etc.) further to increase their relief efforts. We might engage in appropriate diplomatic moves to that end.</p>
                        <p>(3) Engage our political strength through assurances and guarantees short of the use of force to try to break the impasse over relief arrangements. This course would have to take into account the political cost of obtaining acceptance by the parties of relief arrangements.</p>
                        <p>(4) Increasing the level of our support for humanitarian organizations that have existing airlift programs for flying supplies into the enclave and providing support to other humanitarian organizations that may initiate airlift relief programs for Biafra. (Support would consist of increased relief supplies and might extend to the provision of additional U.S. aircraft or funds to finance non-U.S. charter aircraft.) This is the one practical course available at the present time to achieve an effective increase in relief flow to Biafra. It would, however, put further strain on our relations with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d143-03" facs="d143-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Future Course of Action</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is still in the U.S. interest, from the humanitarian as well as from the domestic political standpoint, to continue to maximize the flow of relief to the Biafran enclave. It is assumed that domestic political opinion would not at this stage permit disengagement from the relief effort. At the same time there is an inherent unlikelihood of ever bringing about an agreement between the parties for relief arrangements without impossible political commitments by the U.S. The only feasible course therefore is Course No. 4 of increasing our support to airlift programs capable of ensuring a more adequate flow of supplies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Implementation - Primary Action</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The primary supporting action with which the Department is planning to proceed is:</p>
                        <p>(1) Increased support for <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, including acquiescence in the transfer from <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> of its C-97ʼs and increased financial assistance to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>-USA (the American component of the church relief consortium). Two of these C-97ʼs would be positioned at Tel Aviv, the <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> maintenance base, and serve as both a maintenance back-up for <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> and a contingency reserve for <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> should it fly again. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> would transfer its other two C-97ʼs directly to <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>, one as an additional aircraft already promised and not picked up, and one as a replacement for a C-97 already in the fleet and not economically reparable. Five C-97ʼs instead of the present four will then be positioned at Sao Tome, the operating base for <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> flights into the enclave. Four of these C-97ʼs would be in an operational status and one would be used for back-up purposes. This transfer action by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> would both facilitate overhaul in Tel Aviv of the aging C-97 fleet and assure that four C-97ʼs rather than the present three will be available to fly each night from Sao Tome. It will enable <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> to augment its present airlift capacity by 18 percent or 28 tons over the present 150 ton nightly average.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d143-04" facs="d143-04"/>
                        <p>(2) Additional increase of <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> tonnage is possible through replacing its fleet of low capacity DC-6ʼs with higher capacity Constellations and/or C-97ʼs (increase of approximately 26 percent or 40 tons a night) and expanding the facilities at Sao Tome to accommodate two or three more of this size aircraft (an approximate increase of 40 percent or 60 tons a night). Those actions could increase the airlift by 85 percent or an average of 128 tons a night above the present level. It would bring us to a goal of 300 tons per night of relief supplies airlifted into Biafra from Sao Tome which is the maximum that could be handled by that base.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Inherent Problems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) In adopting the proposed action, which appears at present to be the only viable plan for effecting an immediate resumption of a more adequate flow of relief supplies, we are committing ourselves to a possible collision course with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will certainly be aroused over increased U.S. support for what they consider illegal, clandestine operations. The Nigerians would have reason to feel particularly resentful after what they consider to be their forthcoming and constructive response in accepting the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> daylight flight proposal. We would seem to be instead rewarding Biafran intransigence on daylight flights and in the face of strong Biafran attacks on the United States. <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> policy is to interdict the night relief flights once their night intercept capability permits them to do so. As a result, the danger of a <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>-operated C-97 being shot down, its American crew killed, captured or tried, and a direct confrontation with the TFMG is very real. At the very least, we will have to expect to bear the heat of Nigerian ire and accusations that our policy is pro-Biafran and at the risk of possible reprisals against American citizens and interests.</p>
                        <p>(2) This risk might be more manageable through efforts to increase the tolerance of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, such as continuation of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>ʼs and <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>ʼs daylight flight discussions, <pb n="5" xml:id="d143-05" facs="d143-05"/>attempts to provide the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> with manifests certifying the innocence of <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> cargo, and the possibility of installing an electronics capability offering the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> positive identification of relief aircraft. The risk may also be somewhat diluted by the ability of Balair (flight contractor for <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss>) to recruit foreign crews for the C-97ʼs and by the use of Constellation aircraft.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Supporting Steps</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Supporting steps which would help our efforts on Nigerian relief are:</p>
                        <p>(1) Financial support for supplies or charters to national Red Cross Societies and other humanitarian organizations willing to undertake the previous functions of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> in managing and sponsoring airlift operations into Biafra. Such U.S. support would be channeled through the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> which in turn would support existing relief agencies or create new ones to fly relief supplies at night for support of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> teams in Biafra. This option may be difficult to implement owing to (a) legal difficulties faced by national societies in flying without a formal <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> relief agreement, and (b) the unwillingness expressed by several societies to take all the flight risks while the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> merely distributes the supplies at the end of the line.</p>
                        <p>(2) Encourage the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> or national Red Cross Societies to negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and the Biafrans an air drop scheme involving a neutralized drop zone removed from strategic targets.</p>
                        <p>(3) Explore further the Cross River project by suggesting a third round of talks and seeking some international organization or third party other than the U.S. to sponsor and guarantee the route.,</p>
                        <p>(4) A direct approach to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General U Thant to suggest and explain the creation of an Emergency <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Relief Force which among other matters might act as the sponsor and guarantor of the Cross River relief route.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d143-06" facs="d143-06"/>
                        <p>(5) Support various efforts by the Pope, the Hague Group, and the Swiss for a Humanitarian Truce over the Christmas holidays during which time a massive airlift would be mounted around the clock to inundate Biafra with relief supplies. Encourage these parties to coordinate among themselves and to work through appropriate African leaders who are friends of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and Biafra.</p>

It is still uncertain whether these preliminary talks will take place and, if they do, even more doubtful that they will lead to serious negotiation. We are continuing to explore what the U.S. and other outside Governments can do to encourage and support negotiations. I have recently held useful talks with the Foreign Ministers of France and Britain during my European trip, We expect to consult further with France and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the next few weeks on specific cooperative measures that can be taken without direct involvement. We are considering US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French diplomatic influence on the two parties; possible help to African mediation efforts; outside assistance in developing a neutral observer force to meet security concerns; and a possible international consortium to offer resources and assistance in postwar re-construction.</p>

                        <p>10. Appeal for Christmas Humanitarian Truce in Biafra. I (<persName corresp="#p_MR2">Roger Morris</persName>) propose we put before the President the choice of issuing a major appeal for a week or so of truce around Christmas to fly in emergency relief to the increasingly desperate Biafrans:</p>
                        <p>--It should be a joint appeal, enlisting the Pope, Trudeau, Heads of State of the major European donors, and any Africans who will come along, especially <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>.</p>
                        <p>--It would be strictly for relief, with no political demands on the parties.</p>
                        <p>--Even if it fails, the Presidentʼs position would be visibly strengthened for the further tragedy that lies ahead, whatever the course of the war.</p>
                        <p>--<persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> is very enthusiastic about this idea and thinks we could get everyone to sign on. The African Bureau can be expected to drag its feet for the usual reasons of Nigerian and general African sensitivities. I recommend you ask <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> to consider the idea from all sides and give us their recommendation early next week.</p>

                        <list type="subject">
                            <head>SUBJECT:</head>
                            <item>Relief Survey Mission to Biafra, October 17-28,</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The recent U/CF Biafra Relief Survey Mission had two major results: (1) the U/CF team was able to document trends by comparing current data with that obtained on the earlier visits last spring; and (2) to obtain, for the first time, firm data on the size and condition of the civilian population in Biafra. We conclude that the overall nutritional condition of the people has deteriorated seriously since June. The population of Biafra is approximately 3.2 million, considerably lower than the figures commonly quoted by the relief agencies, Biafran authorities, or the world press. Public release of either of these conclusions will undoubtedly have serious political repercussions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Disparity in Conditions</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The survey team was struck by the enormous difference between the welfare of people living near main arteries and those in the remote areas. Prolonged rains have made some villages virtually inaccessible to relief teams, while duplication in relief distribution has given some people more than they need. Unevenness was also found between different age groups. Although severe malnutrition is prevalent in all parts of the population, <pb n="2" xml:id="d145-02" facs="d145-02"/>it is far more widespread among persons over 45 (52% incidence of edema) and under four (42%) than it is among young adults (17%).</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Attitudes</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>While no attempt was made to measure popular morale on a scientific basis, the U/CF team gained a distinct impression of war weariness and tedium among “the little people.” Relative stabilization of the lines and more discriminating Nigerian air strikes have tempered immediate fears, while nutritional deterioration in the bush areas has caused listlessness and despair. Protestations of strong grass roots support for the Biafran leaders are still heard, but sound less enthusiastic and more defensive than in the past.</p>
                        <p>The leaders, for their part, appear, in effect, to have amortized their own people. Having paradoxically written off the population as the price for “Biafran security”, they appear to harden their position on relief proposals proportionately as the health conditions deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>The weakening of the popular will is reflected in the lessening of discipline, especially within the army. The survey team observed an increased rate of food pilferage and commandeering of relief vehicles by soldiers, as well as black market transactions for personal gain.</p>
                        <p>The distinction between soldiers and civilians in determining eligibility for relief assistance has become increasingly hazy. Suffering soldiers are given food and medical attention by the relief agencies, and the general population is viewed as a potential army as the circle around the enclave draws tighter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Population</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The 3.2 million population figure is based on a sampling technique which utilized our record of the total number of vaccinations given during last springʼs comprehensive smallpox vaccination campaign in Biafra. Allowing some room for such variables <pb n="3" xml:id="d145-03" facs="d145-03"/>as population movement into or out of the enclave and inaccessibility of some areas for either vaccination or sampling, this figure is believed to be quite reliable. We can certainly say with some confidence that the total is less than four million, the lowest previous figure on which relief needs were based. Of this number, some 60 percent are children under 15 years old, while 23 percent are under four.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Medical Conditions</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Widespread malnutrition has increased the susceptibility of the population to all diseases ordinarily endemic in the area. There is an added threat of epidemics of measles, whooping cough, and hepatitis. On the other hand, smallpox, tuberculosis, and yellow fever were not seen by the survey team, despite the fact that a yellow fever epidemic has occurred in the surrounding areas of West Africa in recent months.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Death Rate</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is impossible to determine how many people have died in Biafra as a result of the war. Hospital death rates obtained for this survey are valuable as indices, but they cannot be applied to the general population. The Biafran Ministry of Health death reporting system has broken down, and what reports are received from villages or refugee camps are unreliable for a number of reasons.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief Priorities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The findings of the survey mission clearly suggest that on the basis of the revised total population figure, it would be possible to meet the bare minimum nutritional needs of the Biafran people with as little as 160 tons of relief supplies per night. To do so, however, airlift shipments would have to be limited to high protein food items and current duplication in internal distribution by the different relief agencies would have to be eliminated. Given present conditions, it is more likely that the minimum tonnage necessary remains at approximately 300 <pb n="4" xml:id="d145-04" facs="d145-04"/>tons per night. During the month of November, relief deliveries to Biafra from all sources averaged about 200 tons per night.</p>

                            <item>US <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Projects Bearing on the Nigerian-Biafran War</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The following is for your background on this morningʼs story by Evans and Novak that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is building a road which is of potential military value to the Federal Forces surrounding Biafra. (A copy of the Evans-Novak piece is at Tab A). My staff learned of this project only recently, and is in the process of a thorough investigation -- including not only the specifics of the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> projects but also a detailed estimate from the intelligence community on the present or potential relevance of the projects to the Federal war effort.</p>
                        <p>The road in question is one of several projects financed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 by $3 million Supporting Assistance, which <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> presents as short-term rehabilitation aid to Federal Nigeria. In principle, this program is consistent with our overall relief policy to get food and medicine to the needy on both sides. In addition to the Biafran aid, our relief has helped feed almost one million behind Federal lines.</p>
                        <p>The main projects and their political-military implications are:</p>
                        <p>The Calabar Road (to which Evans-Novak refer)</p>
                        <p>A map showing the road and its relationship to the main sectors of Federal military activity is at Tab B. This project dates back to 1963. Its economic rationale (sensible enough) is to offer an additional trading route for products from Northern Nigeria going out through the port of Calabar. Work was suspended when the war began in 1966. Construction was resumed last year under the rationale that this would make possible a wider distribution of relief northward from the port.</p>
                        <p>Our initial estimate is that the road is not of military value to the Federals --</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d146-02" facs="d146-02"/>
                        <p>--This eastern front of Biafra is extremely inactive. Our intelligence finds not much more than a battalion on the Federal side, and probably even less on the Biafran side. And since neither army has decent engineering, the Cross River dividing them is a formidable natural barrier.</p>
                        <p>--The port of Calabar simply lacks the capacity for any size-able supply operation for the Federal Army.</p>
                        <p>--The northern leg of the road is still unpaved, which would make it soon impassable if it were used by more than an occasional truck or jeep.</p>
                        <p>--The Federals have trouble enough maintaining their shorter lines of supply in the North and South, let alone trying to use this more extended route along the East, even if the road were passable.</p>
                        <p>There remains, however, the very real problem that 40 some Americans on the construction crew are now working in places five or six miles from the Biafran lines. The Biafrans undoubtedly understand that the road is of dubious military value. But its political-propaganda significance may well tempt them to a raid. This could mean American casualties or hostages.</p>
                        <p>Thus, although <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is justifying the road for relief purposes, a large segment of it is simply not useable for any supply operation, relief or military. My view is that we should think seriously about suspending the American construction effort simply on the grounds of potential danger to our citizens in a war zone.</p>
                        <p>Supply of Heavy Trucks and Road-Grading Equipment</p>
                        <p>These too are ostensibly to facilitate relief on the Federal side. There is no hard evidence that they are used otherwise. But once we turn such equipment over to the Nigerians, we have no real control over possible exploitation for military purposes. Road graders in particular could be useful to Federal forces trying to advance along the hotly-contested southern front, where the main Biafran tactic of defense is to disrupt the well-developed road system to stop Federal armored cars.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d146-03" facs="d146-03"/>
                        <p>In sum, the Calabar Road poses some danger to the American contractors, and US-supplied equipment is in the grey area between legitimate relief and de facto logistical support for the Federals. These programs should be reassessed to bring them wholly into line with your policy of neutrality in this war.</p>
                        <p>I am reviewing this matter further with State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> -- and will have a recommendation to you in the next few days.</p>

                        <p>FOR AMBASSADOR FROM UNDER SECRETARY</p>
                        <p>1. Request you seek appointment <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> at earliest possible time and convey following message from Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. USG has been much encouraged by prospect Addis talks under <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> aegis and by <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> statesmanlike and constructive attitude in agreeing to talks. Under Secretary has now read with concern confusing current press reports re present state Addis talks. Reports indicate Biafran delegation en route but Federal participation in doubt. We appreciate these preliminary unconditional talks do not meet <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> declared requirements for substantive negotiations. However, we hope they might lead to more substantive negotiations and felt <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> taking wise course in demonstrating flexibility and willingness explore opportunity to move toward serious talks.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d147-02" facs="d147-02"/>
                        <p>3. Under Secretary concerned now that <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will be put publicly in position of appearing responsible for failure <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>ʼs effort. Under Secretary is sure <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> will appreciate that friends of Nigeria will have difficult time internationally and in US explaining and defending such outcome. He is concerned that much of sympathy and understanding <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> achieved by constructive attitude daylight flight agreement may be dissipated by such an outcome. In light USG public statements re daylight agreement crediting the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> for constructive attitude and pointing to Biafran failure agree, appearance of <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> responsibility for failure Addis talks would create difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>4. Under Secretary also wishes recall that following conversations <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> here, he has talked with French urging them use influence Biafrans toward negotiations. He wants <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> to know in great confidence that he believes French have, in fact, been helpful in getting Biafran acceptance Addis talks. Our own ability deal effectively with French will be greatly weakened if talks do not materialize. He was most encouraged by talk with <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> here and this message is in spirit of that conversation and in the belief he should convey to <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> our concern.</p>

                        <p>1. ARIKPO RECEIVED ME AT 10:00 A.M. THIS MORNING JUST PRIOR HIS DEPARTURE FOR EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING AT DODAN BARRACKS. HE READ YOUR MESSAGE WITH CARE AND ASKED THAT YOU BE INFORMED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE POINTS YOU MADE AND WOULD BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF GENERAL GOWON. HE PROCEEDED IMMEDIATELY TO SAY WITH GREAT FIRMNESS THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY CONVINCED THAT OJUKWU DID NOT INTEND TO CARRY ON SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS. THE TIME HAD COME TO PUT AN END TO “PROPAGANDA EXERCISES.” THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> HAD ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE EMPERORUS INTENTIONS. “IF HE REPLIES THAT THE TALKS ARE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, WE WILL GO; IF NOT, WE WONʼT. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT. WE WILL NOT CAPITULATE TO OJUKWU.” I SAID THAT WE DID NOT SEE IT AS A QUESTION OF CAPITULATION BUT RATHER ONE OF MAINTAINING A PUBLIC STANCE WHICH WOULD NOT BE MISUNDERSTOOD BY THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE FINE POINTS. ARIKPO SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS OUR VIEW BUT THAT THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> HAD A DUTY TO ITSELF AND TO ITS FRIENDS IN THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> TO UPHOLD THE POSITION OF THAT ORGANIZATION.</p>
                        <p>2. WITH ARIKPO MAKING OBVIOUS SIGNS OF COLLECTING HIS PAPERS TO HEAD FOR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING, THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE THE DISCUSSION, BUT I VERY <pb n="2" xml:id="d148-02" facs="d148-02"/>MUCH DOUBT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROFITABLE TO DO SO IN ANY CASE. IN PARTING ARIKPO CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO REPLY FROM ADDIS TO THEIR REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION. HE PROMISED TO LET ME KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.</p>
                        <p>3. WE ARE OF COURSE COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION. GLASS WAS SEEING GOWON WITH LORD CARRINGTON AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS I CALLED ON ARIKPO. THIS WAS A FAREWELL CALL BY CARRINGTON AND GLASS HAD NO NEW INSTRUCTIONS, THOUGH HE DID INTEND TO USE ANY OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED TO SEEK CLARIFICATION OF THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> POSITION. I WILL BE COMPARING NOTES WITH HIM LATER TODAY.<lb/>GP-2</p>

                        <p>DR. P. N. C. OKIGBO AS LEADER BIAFRAN DELEGATION TO ADDIS ABABA PEACE TALKS ISSUED FOLLOWING STATEMENT TO PRESS AT ADDIS AIRPORT IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO DELEGATIONʼS DEPARTURE THIS AFTERNOON: QTE THE BIAFRAN DELEGATION HAS CALLED THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA TO THE NEWS REPORT ATTRIBUTED TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD SPONSORED THE PROPOSED BIAFRA/NIGERIA PEACE TALKS IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE. AT A SUBSEQUENT MEETING THIS MORNING WITH HIS EXCELLENCY THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF ETHIOPIA, THE BIAFRAN DELEGATION REMINDED HIM THAT NEGOTIATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> COMMITTEE AND ITS MANDATE WHICH HAD ALREADY PRE-DETERMINED THE FORM OF SETTLEMENT, VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS. HIS EXCELLENCY THE FOREIGN MINISTER CONFIRMED THE NEWS REPORT AND SAID THAT HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY COULD NOT ACT OUTSIDE THE TERMS OF THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. IN THE <pb n="2" xml:id="d149-02" facs="d149-02"/>CIRCUMSTANCES, THE BIAFRAN DELEGATION WHICH CAME ON THE CLEAR ASSURANCE FROM HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY THAT HE WAS CONVENING THE TALKS PURELY IN HIS ROLE AS EMPEROR OF ETHIOPIA AND AS AN AFRICAN LEADER, HAS NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO RETURN TO BIAFRA.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN DELEGATION REGRETS THAT THE NIGERIANS HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO TURN UP FOR THE TALKS. THE BIAFRAN DELEGATION BELIEVES THAT THIS TRAGIC WAR WHICH HAS BROUGHT NOTHING BUT SHAME TO AFRICA AND HER LEADERSHIP MUST BE ENDED AND CONDITIONS CREATED FOR NEGOTIATIONS FOR A JUST AND HONOURABLE SETTLEMENT. BIAFRA REMAINS, AS ALWAYS, READY TO ENGAGE IN TALKS WITHOUT ANY PRECONDITIONS AND GENUINELY HOPES THAT ANY SPONSORING AGENCY WILL OBSERVE THIS PRINCIPLE TO FACILITATE MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>THE BIAFRAN DELEGATION THANKS HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY; WE WISH TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONVEY OUR APPRECIATION TO ALL OUR FRIENDS AND TO LOVERS OF PEACE ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO HAVE SHOWN INTEREST IN AND CONCERN FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE BIAFRA/NIGERIA WAR.

                        <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Nigeria/Biafra]</p>
                        <p>R: [continuing]: Item 2 is a Christmas truce in Nigeria. I understand <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> has been interested in this. We have been trying to <pb n="2" xml:id="d150-02" facs="d150-02"/>see if there is any basis we could join with the people of other countries for an appeal to both sides for a truce. We have been in touch with the Hague group, with the Swiss. Hearing the President was interested in it I asked for a check today to be made through our Embassy in Rome with the Vatican. It is so late now nobody could do anything unless the Pope were prepared to do so and we could associate ourselves with has appeal. Stabler (? ) our Minister in Rome talked with Casarobli (?) an authority on this subject in the Vatican. The Pope had considered a truce appeal, had contacted the TMG (?) but had no reply. A TMG response is very unlikely. We had got a negative on the part of anybody else although there is a possibility the Italians may want to make an approach to the Emperor and we are prepared to say our Ambassador there would join with them. We would not think under the circumstances we want to do anything unilaterally especially since the TMG is engaged in a very broad offensive and they would think if we did anything unilaterally we are involving ourselves.</p>
                        <p>K: That sounds right. Why donʼt you have it written up as a memo and I will pass it to the President and we can show that State has acted on his preference.</p>
                        <p>R: All right.</p>
                        <p>K: Are you going to Boston for the Holidays.</p>
                        <p>R: I am going up for the New Year. Are you going away at all?</p>
                        <p>K: I am going with the President to the west coast.</p>
                        <p>R: How long will you be away?</p>
                        <p>K: Until the 4th or 5th.</p>
                        <p>R: Have a good time.</p>
                        <p>K: Thank you. I know we will be working together in the New Year.</p>
                        <p>R: Well, I count on it Henry.</p>
                        <p>K: Even better next year. It has been one of the good things that has happened to me here.</p>

                        <p>The current Federal military offensive has created a new situation in Nigeria, both with respect to relief and third party mediation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Current Military Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Federal forces have isolated the eastern third of the enclave. Although not decisive, loss of this eastern salient would be a serious blow to Biafraʼs cause. Other Federal forces have made gains toward the Biafran capital of Owerri and on the key roads toward Uli airfield, terminus of the relief and arms flights. One Biafran division has collapsed; the important fifteenth division astride the eastern approaches to the center of the enclave is under severe pressure.</p>
                        <p>A recent field survey by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs staff shows a significant decline of discipline and morale within the enclave. Biafran difficulties are compounded by recurrent shortages of ammunition and foreign exchange. Biafraʼs leadership is alarmed at the present deterioration of its military position. Conversely, morale on the Federal side is high. We have no evidence as yet that the current offensive now under way for over a month has run its course--although in the past Federal forces have never succeeded in achieving a decisive victory.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d151-02" facs="d151-02"/>
                        <p>Clearly, Biafraʼs situation is extremely serious and some contingency planning is in order.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Current Relief Problems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Biafraʼs eastern third is believed to contain some 500,000 people--out of a total of some 3 to 4 million--now isolated from outside food supplies. Some 200,000 refugees have crossed into Federally controlled territory since the start of the offensive.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the limitations of the Nigerian Red Cross (NRC), it is the only relief agency acceptable to the Federal Government (<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>). We see no possibility that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will change its position adopted last summer when it assigned over-all responsibility for relief matters within the Federally controlled territory to the NRC. Accordingly, our objective is to obtain the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs consent to an expanded international effort under NRC auspices.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the NRC is shifting several relief teams from other areas to care for the new refugees. We are expanding our support to the NRC, both directly and by contributions via the League of International Red Cross Societies (LICROSS). Personnel of the Embassy have been making a survey in the affected areas in order to determine how we can best assist the NRC.</p>
                        <p>In these efforts, we believe we must proceed with considerable care not to offend or antagonize the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, jeopardizing its essential cooperation. We know from past experience that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is extremely sensitive about outside advice--which it considers interference in Nigerian domestic affairs--especially from the US. We therefore are trying to enlist the support of the British and of interested international agencies to help open the door to an expanded. international effort.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d151-03" facs="d151-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Future Contingencies</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Federal offensive should continue unchecked, we foresee several contingencies:</p>
                        <p>-- Further rapid increases in the number of refugees, some under Federal control, some in areas of continued fighting where relief will be extremely difficult;</p>
                        <p>-- Possibly, interdiction or seizure of Uli airport, resulting in the termination of relief and military supplies to the enclave. (There are other airstrips but these are in the line of the Federal advance or of very limited capability.)</p>
                        <p>As regards the feeding of refugees, the primary task will be to expand the capabilities of the Nigerian Red Cross (relief teams, supplies, local transport).</p>
                        <p>Following the loss of Uli, one possibility of providing relief to the enclave would be air drops from Canadian C-130ʼs or the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> (US-supplied) C-97ʼs still stationed at Cotonou. Neither the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> nor the Canadians would be willing to undertake air drops without <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> consent which would not be forthcoming while the fighting continues. The voluntary agencies now flying relief have indicated that, if Uli were lost, they would probably have to terminate operations. Thus the possibility exists that substantial numbers of people might go without outside food supplies for a considerable period.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d151-04" facs="d151-04"/>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we are continuing efforts to increase the capabilities of the voluntary agencies. Through <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> we are financing a new airlift by the Knights of Malta out of Libreville. As you recall, we are also strengthening the airlift capabilities of JCA by augmenting their fleet of aircraft, including the transfer of two C-97ʼs and financial aid for the purchase or charter of additional large-capacity aircraft.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Diplomatic Initiatives</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With a record of consistent support for the Nigerian war effort, the British have more influence in Lagos than ourselves. Furthermore, the British Government feels domestic pressure over Biafraʼs plight, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and the Director of our Special Nigeria Staff are meeting with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> officials in London this week in order to coordinate <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-US efforts. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> will also hold planning discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross, the League of International Red Cross Societies and the Hague Group composed of donor governments to the Nigerian relief effort. At the same time, the Special Staff Director will continue our dialogue on Nigeria with French officials in Paris.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Prospects for Mediation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We recently approached Sir Arthur Lewis--a distinguished West Indian economist and Director designate of the Caribbean Development Bank--and <pb n="5" xml:id="d151-05" facs="d151-05"/>secured his agreement to undertake a mediating role under appropriate auspices. Highly regarded among Africans he is well known and appears acceptable to both sides, The British agree with us that Sir Arthur is probably the best candidate. They feel strongly, however, that the current military situation makes mediation efforts very unpromising and are opposed to an initiative by Sir Arthur at this time.</p>
                        <p>We have evidence that the Prime Ministers of Ghana and Sierra Leone are trying to arrange secret talks. Sir Arthur is on close terms with the Ghanaian Prime Minister. We also know that the French are urging Biafrans, through Houphouet-Boigny, to respond affirmatively. We have no indication that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would be willing to talk while its offensive is in progress.</p>
                        <p>If prospects for mediation should improve we would plan, working through the British and French and avoiding direct responsibility, to encourage discreetly Sir Arthurʼs initiative.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Late Developments</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>According to an agency report, <persName corresp="#p_FJ3">JACQUES FOCCART</persName> (Secretary General for Afro-Malagasy Affairs in the Elysee) has under consideration a plan to assemble secretly a white mercenary force of 300 to 500 men, using Count von Rosen as cover, While the report is unverified at this writing, other intelligence corroborates various elements. For example, we know that a French officer, security adviser to Houphouet-Boigny, and reportedly a participant in these <pb n="6" xml:id="d151-06" facs="d151-06"/>deliberations with <persName corresp="#p_FJ3">Foccart</persName>, is scheduled to hold talks with Ojukwu at this time. We will give a separate evaluation of this development if borne out by further information.</p>

                        <p>I assume that you wish to utilize the main portion of your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> to discuss the Middle East paper. Your talker for this purpose is on the left flap of this folder together with the Middle East paper. If you have time you will wish to discuss the following additional subjects:</p>
                        <p>1. During your last meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> left a memo with you on the problem of the appointment of a replacement for Bill Colby. Charlie Cooke indicated in the memorandum left with you by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> that MACV may attempt to replace Colby, who is supposed to be leaving at the end of March, with a military officer or to downgrade the position if another civilian is appointed. I cannot comment on the accuracy of this memorandum since I am not aware of any major problems between Colby and Abrams. One thing however is clear -- John Vann is not the man for the job for reasons which I think were all too evident to you. Bill Sullivan and Phil Habib also suggested by Charlie Cooke would, of course, be outstanding in just about any job they might be considered for. I fear, however, that both men can make a greater contribution at a higher level because of their experience and effectiveness. This leaves only <persName corresp="#p_MJA5">Mendenhall</persName>. whom I do not know. I would only add one additional criteria to those mentioned by Charlie Cooke and that is that he should also not be a State bureaucrat or an egomaniac like Bob Komer (Tab A)</p>

                        <p>2. Mention to Elliot that you have received a letter from Secretary Volpe enclosing a copy of his Eyes Only letter to Elliot which deals with the US/Italy Air Transport Agreement. If you discuss this <pb n="4" xml:id="d152-04" facs="d152-04"/>with Elliot now you will be able to assure Volpe that you have done so should he call on you for help. Letter at Tab B.</p>

                        <p>3. The President has written to both you and Pete Flanigan about utilizing Willis Armstrong, who is apparently a close friend of the Presidentʼs, in some foreign policy role.

                        <p>Comments:</p>
                        <p>4. The President has sent you a copy of a memorandum written by Henry Kearns, President of the Export-Import Bank, who wrote some rather sharp impressions about the Foreign Commercial Service. The President affirmed his agreement with Kearnsʼ impressions, especially those which conclude that:</p>
                        <p>a. State Department personnel assigned to commercial and economic representation abroad seldom have any knowledge of business;</p>
                        <p>b. commercial assignments are generally a dead-end for foreign service personnel; and</p>
                        <p>c. Stateʼs selection process discourages aggressive actions by their commercial attaches.</p>
                        <p>Kearns concluded with a recommendation that a Trade Commissioner Corps be established. The President noted that he wants you to shake Samuels hard and get action rather than their continuous tinkering with status quo. I am sure you will want to show the Kearns memorandum and the Presidentʼs hand-written comments to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> (Tab D).</p>

                        <p>8. I know this will be difficult but I believe you should inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> of the initiative taken by Larry Eagleburger on Biafra. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] it is therefore quite likely that State already knows. I think Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> will understand that the Biafrans have refused to deal with State on the issue and it is, therefore, logical that they would contact one of your people. You could also make a point that this was just a feeler operation which you authorized <persName corresp="#p_ELS1">Eagleburger</persName> to explore. (Tab E)</p>

                            <item>Points on Biafran Crisis</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Geographically, there is no real escape for the Biafrans. Their major population centers -- between the Imo and Niger Rivers -- are completely surrounded by Federal forces and hundreds of miles from international boundaries across largely impassable country. Thus, the French proposal to open the Cameroonian border is not a meaningful gesture.</p>
                        <p>2. Logistically, we can provide emergency food and medical supplies by air drops. Current relief operations can be quickly diverted to an air drop scheme with our help. But the fact remains this would have to have Federal acquiescence. And the Feds have been adamantly opposed to air drops.</p>
                        <p>3. Moreover, food and medicine is only part of the problem. The Biafrans are threatened more immediately by an undisciplined and vindictive Federal army. The unspoken Federal war aim, in this collapse as in the starvation blockade, remains the elimination of the Ibos as a tribe.</p>
                        <p>4. We must recognize, therefore, that our problem is as much political as logistical. And the key is not so much the French as the British, who have the ultimate leverage with the Federals. Even the most urgent and dramatic measures to fly in relief will be only a palliative unless we accompany them by an equally firm approach to the British and the Federals to address the political question of Biafraʼs survival.</p>
                        <p>-- This means some kind of armistice agreement in which the French cease their arms supply, the Biafrans in effect surrender, international observers are posted, and the war is ended by <pb n="2" xml:id="d153-02" facs="d153-02"/>an orderly occupation of Biafra with international guarantees for Ibo security.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR2">Morris</persName> Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>This is the tack you should take with the President and with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>. Stateʼs first inclination will be to tread softly with the Federals on the grounds that they are the winning side. Anything short of a strong approach to Lagos will be de facto acquiescence in some degree of genocide. We should cooperate fully with the French, but the key is in London.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Nigerian armed forces have continued to apply heavy pressure against the beleagured Biafrans who are continuing to give up ground. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] advance elements of the Federal forces have entered the outskirts of Owerri, the heavily-populated administrative center. There are also unconfirmed reports that both Owerri and the vital Biafran airfield at Uli are undergoing unusually intense bombardment by Federal aircraft. (Map at Tab A)</p>
                        <p>We have just been informed by the French that according to their sources
[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] the Biafran forces have generally collapsed. Accordingly the French government is taking the following actions.</p>
                        <p>-- They have asked the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> to begin immediate relief into former Biafran territory.</p>
                        <p>-- They have asked the Government of Cameroon to open their borders to Biafran refugees.</p>
                        <p>--They have asked <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> to take steps to allow an immediate increase in the number of observers.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Quaiʼs African Bureau has requested that we take common actions in these grave circumstances.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d154-02" facs="d154-02"/>
                        <p>The practical effect of the French proposals by themselves are minimal.</p>
                        <p>-- We have been pushing the Red Cross to fly into Biafra for months. They will not do so without Federal approval, and the Federals have refused such emergency flights when proposed by the Canadians only last week.</p>
                        <p>-- Opening the Cameroon border is meaningless since the bulk of the Biafran population is totally surrounded by Federal troops and separated from the border by 300 miles of largely trackless ground.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> has chronically stalled in this problem out of deference to African sensitivities. He is highly unlikely to move fast enough -- or at all -- now that the Feds (and their African backers) have finally won.</p>
                        <p>My own first reaction is that we should cooperate closely with the French, but we must recognize our problem is as much political -- with the Federals and their British patrons -- as logistical. If the collapse is genuine, the Biafrans are now more immediately threatened by an undisciplined and vindictive Federal army than by starvation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I recommend you make the following points with the Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>1. We have seen several reports, including information the French have given us, that Biafra may be collapsing. We are very concerned about the potential for further tragedy here, either by disruption of relief compounding the starvation or in military excesses by Federal troops.</p>
                        <p>2. The French seem very concerned as well, and have asked our cooperation in efforts to ward off disaster.</p>
                        <p>3. We want to do all we can to help avoid more agony for the Biafrans, who have already suffered enough.</p>
                        <p>-- We are contacting <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> tonight in West Africa to urge the strengthening of the international observers.</p>
                        <p>-- We are readying various contingency plans to help the relief operation, and will be asking for Federal Nigerian cooperation.</p>
                        <p>-- We will also be urging Nigerians to redouble their own efforts to avoid military excesses by their troops.</p>
                        <p>4. You wanted the Prime Minister to be fully informed of these steps. Our two governments have a common stake in averting tragedy here. We hope to cooperate closely with the British.</p>
                        <p>5. Given the special position Britain has with the Federal Government, we would like to have British support for our representations to the Nigerians on these humanitarian issues. We are sure British advice to the Nigerians would be most effective any outsider can give.</p>

                        <p>3. AS REGARDS THREAT TO BIAFRAN POPULATION WE MAKE NO PREDICTIONS BUT WE DO POINT OUT THAT IN RECENT DAYS WELL <pb n="2" xml:id="d156-02" facs="d156-02"/>OVER 100,000 RESIDENTS OF ENCLAVE, INCLUDING SOME 60,000 IBOS, HAVE COME UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL.

                        <p>4. ON EXPANSION OF OBSERVER GROUP, BELIEVE BEST CHANCE OF ACHIEVING THIS IS IF GROUP ITSELF PROPOSES EXPANSION.

                        </list>
                        <p>The fast-moving Nigerian situation has been receiving our very urgent attention. The following status report is submitted in accordance with the decision reached at the WSAG meeting January 10.</p>
                        <p>1. MILITARY ASSESSMENT</p>
                        <p>According to the latest information we have on the developing military situation in Nigeria, the Federal advance continues and an early Biafran capitulation or disintegration is likely. Organized resistance continues and may well continue for some - time but the key airfield (Uli) is under aerial attack and is probably not operating. The Biafran capital of Owerri has reportedly been captured, and <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> has left the enclave, perhaps for Abidjan, to try to arrange for an honorable peace. With the military reverses, breakdown of administration and very serious reduction if not elimination of air supply of materiel, it seems only a question of time before the end. Psychologically, <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs departure could have a very damaging effect on morale. Both the British and the French regard the situation as militarily hopeless for the Biafrans.</p>
                        <p>2. RESULTANT PROBLEMS</p>
                        <p>The most immediate result of the Biafran collapse will be a horde of refugees. There will be two aspects to the problem of dealing with them, relief and security.</p>
                        <p>A. Relief. The breakdown in Biafran administration, and the severe protein shortage which the enclave has <pb n="2" xml:id="d157-02" facs="d157-02"/>been suffering means that extraordinary measures may have to be taken for a period of some weeks to prevent mass starvation. The degree to which the civilian population can be reached during this period will depend on the level of armed resistance that still continues and on <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> cooperation. It may be that substantial numbers of these needy might be cut off with no way of reaching them except through the use of an air drop or helicopters.</p>
                        <p>B. Security. The expressed genocidal fear of the Biafrans may cause large numbers to retreat in terror before advancing Federal troops and hide in the bush, thus making relief operations difficult if not impossible. For its part the Federal Government has enunciated a policy of reconciliation and its performance to date has been reassuring. A code of conduct for the troops has-been issued, and an international observer group which was invited into Nigeria in 1968 has found no evidence of atrocities. The Federal Army has been cooperating with the Nigerian Red Cross in feeding refugees displaced by the current offensive. On January 10 <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> appealed to his troops to follow the “Code of Conduct” and to welcome Ibos attempting to cross Federal lines. He publicly reassured the Ibos that they have nothing to be afraid of in rejoining their brothers in the Federation. Nevertheless the possibility of atrocities by advancing troops cannot be excluded. The inter-national community is very alive to this possibility, as are we.</p>
                        <p>3. WHAT WE ARE DOING</p>
                        <p>A. Relief. As signs accumulated several weeks ago that the Federal offensive would likely be successful, we embarked on full-scale contingency planning for the eventuality of a rapid overrun of Biafran territory <pb n="3" xml:id="d157-03" facs="d157-03"/>by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> forces. We solicited the fullest information from the field on the status of the current relief effort. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, your Nigerian Relief Coordinator, and Mr. Brubeck, Director of our Special Staff for Nigeria, went to London to concert with the British. Mr. Brubeck went on to Paris for discussions with the French and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> to Geneva and other points in Europe for planning meetings with those international organizations and governments involved in the international relief effort. At the same time, concerned for the safety of expatriate relief workers within the enclave, we contacted the voluntary agencies as well as our embassies in Lagos and Libreville to ascertain how many Americans might still be inside and to alert the agencies to the developing military situation. As far as we are able to determine, no more than a dozen were inside the enclave and we believe that virtually all of these have been evacuated.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these planning efforts and consultations we have been able to assure that the Nigerian Red Cross, charged with the responsibility for relief by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, is alert to the problem and is moving energetically, with the full cooperation of the Nigerian Army, to respond to the developing emergency situation. Sufficient supplies are in place, en route, or on order, to meet the anticipated needs of up to two million refugees. Steps have been taken to obtain additional transport to augment the internal distribution capability of relief teams. The NRC is meeting January 12 with the already-established relief coordinating committee in Lagos. This committee includes participating voluntary agencies and governments including the United States. The Nigerian military will also participate. The problems to which attention must continue to be given are those of stockpiling, transport and the availability of needed relief workers. Depending on <pb n="4" xml:id="d157-04" facs="d157-04"/>circumstances, the need may develop for an airlift, air drop or internal helicopter transport. Steps are being taken to assure the availability of civilian air transport (e.g. <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> C-97s). US military C-130s will be considered as a fallback resource (security situation in Nigeria permitting), pending indications of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs reaction to our offer to make them available. We and the British are endeavoring to get advance <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> approval for such emergency measures as well as the use of a designated relief airfield, either Uli or Obilagu.</p>
                        <p>B. Security. The most immediate need is to secure <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> approval to the expansion of existing observer teams. Following consultations in London and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>ʼs conversation with you on January 10, he communicated with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> on the importance of expanded observer teams. British High Commissioner Glass in Lagos was instructed to follow up on his initiative and Ambassador TRUEHEART was instructed to support Glassʼs efforts. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> has despatched a representative to take up the same question with General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and British Parliamentary Under Secretary FOLEY have both discussed the question with <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> in Yaounde and both will follow up with Gowon in Lagos on Tuesday, January 13.</p>
                        <p>If the worst happens, and atrocities take place, we, of course, would make representations to Lagos and enlist the help and intervention with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, and, through the Emperor, the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. There would also be the possibility of taking the problem to the United Nations Security Council. The more drastic alternative, direct military intervention, would not appear to ʼbe in the United States interest. The problem that will most likely face us will not be one <pb n="5" xml:id="d157-05" facs="d157-05"/>of clear-cut large-scale massacres but isolated atrocities. It will be necessary for us to make a judgment on the appropriate response based on the specific facts at the time, We will endeavor to keep the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the forefront of any international activity on the security problem.</p>
                        <p>We have prepared messages for you to send to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName>, the Emperor of Ethiopia and President Houphouet-Boigny, making clear your great interest in the problems of relief and security and expressing your desire to concert our actions with them.</p>
                        <p>4. CONCLUSION</p>
                        <p>The problem that faces us with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> now is that of persuading it to use the resources the US and other countries can make vailable without creating the impression we are trying to usurp its own proper role, Our approaches to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> must be low-key. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is extremely sensitive to what it considers external meddling, as indicated by General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs statement on January 11 warning foreign governments and organizations not to “meddle in Nigerian affairs.”</p>
                        <p>It is important that we have a clear record demonstrating our support of an expanded relief effort. We think the work of the past weeks in contingency planning and consultations with other governments, and your own actions and statements make this record amply. We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the international community and the press thoroughly understand our efforts.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Following up your second telephone conversation with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> yesterday, I find that there is about $20 million --evenly divided between operating funds and PL 480 food -- available for Biafran relief for the balance of the fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that we announce your authorization of a $10 million emergency contribution this morning. The sum would represent both operating costs and PL 480 food to be given among the Inter-national Red Cross, the religious relief agencies, and the Nigerian Red Cross.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I think we should announce that you are sending a message to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> referring to this contribution and offering both (a) aircraft and other assistance for emergency relief, and (b) logistical help for an augmented international observer force (proposed message at Tab A). The situation in Biafra remains very fluid, with organized Biafran forces still putting up stiff resistance. So far, there are no reports of Federal atrocities. But the magnitude of the relief problem will be highlighted as outside observers follow the Federals into Biafra, and the risk of military excesses is still very much with us. Thus, I think it makes sense to keep going on the record with urgent and generous action.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation</p>
                        <p>That you authorize announcement of a $10 million emergency donation to Biafra relief, and approve the message to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> at Tab A.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>:</p>
                        <p>As the advance of Federal troops makes possible substantial relief to long-suffering victims of the civil war, I want to reaffirm my governmentʼs readiness to provide any further assistance you need in meeting the urgent problems arising from the present military situation.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, developments in the war zone are first and foremost a matter of Nigerian internal, concern and know how dedicated you are to ending this ordeal for all your countrymen. This message is to pledge to you our fullest support for the relief and rehabilitation programs under the auspices of the Federal Military Government.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I have directed that $10 million be provided immediately for emergency relief needs. I have already taken steps to alert U.S. cargo aircraft and helicopters to make them available <pb n="3" xml:id="d158-03" facs="d158-03"/>promptly to assist you should you desire them. I have also asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and Ambassador TRUEHEART in Lagos to continue their close cooperation with your authorities and other governments and agencies in support of Nigerian relief programs. In particular, I have instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> to give you all the information he has on relief needs in eastern Nigeria, which may be helpful as your own relief workers move into newly-occupied territory.</p>
                        <p>Just as we share your concern to avert starvation, we have also shared a concern that the reconciliation of your country be rapid and lasting. In that connection, I have much admired your statements and actions on behalf of the safety of the Ibo people. I understand that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> are in touch with you with regard to the augmentation of the International Observer <pb n="4" xml:id="d158-04" facs="d158-04"/>Group, which was formed in 1968 at your own initiative. I too believe that these observer teams can be of great value to both Nigeria and her friends in providing international recognition of your conciliatory policy.</p>
                        <p>For our part, the United States will provide whatever logistical support in vehicles and other material which would be helpful to the effective functioning of an augmented observer force. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> will, of course, be talking with you personally about both relief matters and how we might help facilitate the work of the international observers.</p>
                        <p>I know there are still difficult days ahead. You have Americaʼs firm support and understanding as you face these challenges, and I know we can continue to work together until Nigeria is once again a leader in the peaceful development of Africa.</p>
                        <closer>Sincerely,</closer>

                        <p>K: <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has asked whether you objected if he went to Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>P: I donʼt object except for one thing. I donʼt want to have that Lagos government on the back when this Gowon is making speeches that are as strong as that. Tell him he has got to make a judgement on where he goes but tell him I think he has got to deal very strongly. Did you know they have had a demonstration in Rome. The Catholics. The Belgians are going to try to fly in some help. Basically we are talking about religious. This is a Catholic thing. Does Gowan refers to us as having blood on our hands?</p>
                        <p>K: No, he talks about these voluntary relief organizations.</p>
                        <p>P: I think the way with Bill -- we donʼt want to argue about it. You could just say to him look Bill, the President has confidence in you. But you must make a cold judgment on this. Here is where we need that Vatican ambassador. I would like to know what the Vatican feels about this. Donʼt we have some responsibility for 400 million people? They are starving arenʼt they?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d159-03" facs="d159-03"/>
                        <p>K: Yes, Mr. President, every week they kill a few tens of thousands of people.</p>
                        <p>P: I donʼt think they feel we are going sort of hind-tit to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and sucking around that government. Tell Bill if he announces he is going to Lagos he should do it on the basis that he wants to go and be of assistance. If he could play it that way. The purpose is not to go and then back down in front of [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. But certainly the Nigerians have got us where the hair is short. If they donʼt let us in we canʼt get in. I think Bill ought to play that cold and help the Nigerians too.</p>
                        <p>K: A lot of the State Dept people here say by our being so active this weekend that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> would get mad at us.</p>
                        <p>P: I understand that but this is a civil war. Tell Bill I think he has got a great opportunity here. I would appreciate it if he goes and that if he does indicate Presidential concern that we have expressed so deeply and we donʼt want to interfere with internal affairs but he ought to make a little statement about our interest in the humanitarian concern. He must talk to the leaders there. I do know that if we go in and just sort of turn our backs on this think, Henry, we could look awful bad.</p>
                        <p>K: You have been getting a lot of mail from Catholics leaders like Father Hessberg.</p>
                        <p>P: I would like Bill to contact Hessberg and Cardinal Cook. I think it would be very good internal American politics if he could indicate to the Catholics leaders before he goes that he is going to exert all the influence of the U.S. to render relief.</p>

                        <p>1. BIAFRA SECESSIONIST LEADER GENERAL ODUMEGWU OJUKWU HAS BEEN STAYING IN A PRIVATE VILLA IN LIBREVILLE SINCE HIS DEPARTURE FROM BIAFRA. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] TO THE FRENCH GOVERMENT <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName> SAID THAT HE WAS DEPARTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISHES OF HIS GENERAL STAFF AND TO SPARE HIS PEOPLE FROM EXTERMINATION. CHRISTOPHER ONYEKWELU, BIAFRAN FINANCE MAN IN EUROPE AND BROTHER-IN- LAW OF <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName>, WAS GIVEN A ROUND-TRIP TICKET TO LIBREVILLE ON 13 JANUARY BY THE FRENCH GENERAL SECRETARIAT FOR AFRICAN AND MALAGASY AFFAIRS IN PARIS AND WILL JOIN OJUWKU IN LIBREVILLE ON 14 JANUARY. <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">C.C. MOJEKWU</persName>, BIAFRAN REPRESENTATIVE IN LISBON, HAS ALSO DEPARTED BY AIR FOR LIBREVILLE. FRENCH SECRETARY GENERAL FOR AFRICAN AND MALAGASY AFFAIRS <persName corresp="#p_FJ3">JACQUES FOCCART</persName> HAS LEFT YAOUNDE WHERE HE WAS ATTENDING CAMEROONʼS TENTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS TO MEET WITH <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName> IN LIBREVILLE. BIAFRAN MINISTER OF JUSTICE MBANEFO HAS REMAINED IN BIAFRA.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d160-02" facs="d160-02"/>
                        <p>2. ON THE EVENING OF 13 JANUARY 1970 FOCCARTʼS DEPUTY JEAN MAURICHEAU-BEAUPRE WENT TO SEE FRENCH MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE MICHEL DEBRE. <persName corresp="#p_DM4">DEBRE</persName> AND MAURICHEAU-BEAUPRE DECIDED TO HAVE THE STOCK OF FRENCH-SUPPLIED ARMS REMOVED [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] AND DIVIDED BETWEEN THE FRENCH BASES AT DOUALA AND ABIDJAN. MAURICHEAU-BEAUPRE SAID THAT FRANCE HAD SENT $30,000,000 IN MATERIAL TO BIAFRA, LENT IVORY COAST PRESIDENT HOUPHOUET-BOIGNY $3,000,000 FOR BIAFRAN OPERATIONS, AND FACES A DEBT OF CIRCA $400,000 FOR [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] SERVICES.</p>
                        <p>3. THERE ARE AT PRESENT NO PLANS FOR FRENCH SUPPORT TO BIAFRAN GUERRILLA RESISTANCE. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS POSITION AS EXPRESSED BY MAURICHEAU-BEAUPRE TO INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED WITH EXECUTING BIAFRAN OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS: “FRANCE SUPPORTED BIAFRA BECAUSE OF THE OIL AND ERAP, BUT NOT THE IBO REVOLUTION. THE SUPPORT WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO A HANDFUL OF BlAFRAN BOURGEOISE IN RETURN FOR THE OIL. THERE IS NO POPULAR SUPPORT IN BIAFRA FOR A GUERRILLA WAR NOW. THE REAL IBO MENTALITY IS MUCH FARTHER TO THE LEFT THAN THAT OF <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">OJUKWU</persName> AND EVEN IF WE HAD WON, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PROBLEM OF KEEPING HIM IN POWER IN THE FACE OF LEFTIST INFILTRATION.”</p>

                        <p>Concerning the $10 million emergency aid we have offered, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> that nothing is being done with it yet, while the Federal government assesses needs. A message has come in this morning from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> to the President, saying that we face a critical period ahead and this is the time for some discreet pressure. Hunt, a special envoy for the British, is on his way to Lagos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> noted that a wrap-up report is due from State today. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he wanted a covering two-page memorandum to <pb n="2" xml:id="d161-02" facs="d161-02"/>the President which would discuss what has happened, who has said what and what the consequences are. The State memo can be forwarded as an attachment to this.</p>
                        <p>Concerning our public position, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said we must maintain our morale stance. We cannot accept the concept that whatever Lagos does is right. For press briefing purposes, we must say that the Nigerian government can have no doubt about the depth of our concern. We have offered support and we hope they inform us as to their needs. But the important point is that at every occasion we must stress our concern.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Following up <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>ʼs telephone conversation with you last night, the following suggests steps we might take to deal with the problems facing us in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Our Immediate Dilemma</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> is taking his own time about relief while public reports (rightly or wrongly) trumpet massive needs. The Federal position springs in part from extreme national pride tinged with xenophobia, in part from their chronic insensitivity to domestic pressures experienced by their western patrons, and in part from honest ignorance of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Obviously we have to observe their pride and sensitivity. But is is equally clear that neither we nor they should tolerate (a) under-estimation of the domestic pressures here or (b) their ignorance of the need. There are two salient facts from our experience: (1) we have an ample record on which to judge Nigerian efficiency from the last 2-1/2 years of war; (2) we already have a good idea of the food needs in Biafra on the basis of the Western Report done only last November. The implications of the report are very serious.</p>
                        <p>We cannot afford the luxury, therefore, of confidence. If large numbers of people starve -- or, more likely, if there are “reports” of mass starvation which we could neither confirm nor deny conclusively -- we will dissipate most of the public credit we have built up. One can foresee a sequence in which our present posture, designed to preserve our standing with the Federals, leads instead to a rupture. Given the choice between making his own moral position clear as against observing Federal sensitivities, the President will be hard-pressed not to make a statement which will poison the well in Lagos.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d162-02" facs="d162-02"/>
                        <p>We need to strike a balance between (a) playing for time with the Federals and (b) containing the pressures here which could force our hand before Gowon is persuaded. This means:</p>
                        <p>-- low-key, but sustained evidence of our seriousness in Lagos;</p>
                        <p>-- actions cleared with the Federals, but which are highly visible gestures that something is moving after all our claims of urgency and readiness over the past few days.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">What Can We Do?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Henry thinks the following steps have merit, and asks that I outline them for your consideration:</p>
                        <p>1. Dave Newsom should give the Western Report to Federal relief officials at once, taking along Dr. Conrad (one of the experts familiar with the Report) to comment on its relevance to the present crisis.</p>
                        <p>-- This approach would be a natural follow-up to the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. We offered to furnish Fergusonʼs information, and we would be consonant with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs claim that the Federals were conducting an urgent assessment of the situation.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> should remain in Lagos, however, to emphasize the importance we attach to prompt, initial reply from the Federals on (a) their reaction to the Western Report and (b) results of their study of the relief requirements. This would also give him an opportunity to have more conversations with Federal relief officials, relief workers returning from the scene, and perhaps even to get out to the East if Federal attitudes on a visit change (as they certainly could) over the next few days.</p>
                        <p>-- We would be striking the pose that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, a senior official required in Washington, is staying in Lagos nonetheless because of the urgency of the need outlined in the Western Report and the US expectation that the Federals, true to their word, will <pb n="3" xml:id="d162-03" facs="d162-03"/>respond if the need is documented. Obviously the Feds will still conduct their own survey and stall for time, but <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>ʼs presence is the kind of low-key pressure we should maintain. If Dave flies out tomorrow, we will have let the Federals off the hook on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs proud put-off.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> should not, however, associate himself with the Hunt Mission to Lagos. As Joe Palmer used to warn, the Federals recoil most rapidly when they think others are ganging up on them. And we already have incurred some of that reaction as a result of the Presidentʼs telephone conversations with Wilson. We should begin to play down the British-US concert.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> should also remain in Lagos for direct talks with,</p>
                        <p>(a) the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>ʼs General Kahn to follow up the observer issue and</p>
                        <p>(b) UNICEFʼs Labouisse, for reasons outlined below.</p>
                        <p>2. Dr. Conrad, joined by Gene Dewey and George Thomas from Fergusonʼs staff -- (and also preferably by Drs. Western and Foege) --should proceed quietly to Port Harcourt as part of the normal <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> pattern of staffing. They should continue as far as they can get into area of need. This would be an unpublicized mission, but it would establish a record (as does the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> presence) that we are on top of the situation when we know, from the earlier Western Report, that the need is likely to be very great.</p>
                        <p>3. Immediate and visible airlift: We should forget the C-130s out of deference to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs objection to military aircraft, but we should move immediately to charter large transports to do the following:</p>
                        <p>-- Coordinate with UNICEF to finance and transport to Cotonou 48 trucks now ready to move from Detroit. UNICEF is ready to go on this if we provide the funds. The trucks could be driven into Nigeria from Dahomey, and UNICEF thinks they can clear the coast with the Feds. We would want to check that of course.</p>
                        <p>-- Charter and transport for UNICEF 18 helicopters (3-1/2 tons) to be crewed by civilians chartered by UNICEF. Again, UNICEF is ready to move on this with charter crews if they have assurance of financial support from us.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d162-04" facs="d162-04"/>
                        <p>-- Support UNICEF as they think necessary in their approach to the Federals. UNICEF says there is a precedent for both the trucks and the helicopters, and they think they could get Federal acquiescence for landing at Port Harcourt, Calabar, Enugu and Benin City if they go to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> with a definite package support by the US.</p>
                        <p>-- This UNICEF package would probably run roughly $4 million.</p>
                        <p>-- We could also fly the prepackaged hospitals to Cotonou. And even have C-130s ferrying food to bring the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> stocks up to capacity at Cotonou. (It takes 3-6 weeks to get present pipeline food on the scene.)</p>
                        <p>4. Either through UNICEF or LICROSS, offer the Nigerian Red Cross $2 million for local purchase of foodstuffs for the first 30 days of occupation. Like the provision of transport, this accords with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs own assessment that food is available locally. We should test the Nigerian approach and give them every opportunity to see if local purchases will meet the need.</p>
                        <p>5. Simultaneously, we should order advance production of 20,000 tons of high protein and relief food per month to keep up the pipeline against the possible and probably likely prospect that (a) the 13, 000ton stockpile in the area will be depleted faster than we expect if there is effective relief, (b) the 11,000 tons outside the area cannot be transported into the enclave as rapidly as we expect, (c) that Nigerian locally-purchased food will run dry in 30 days or sooner. (It is ominous -- and symptomatic, I think -- that the Nigerian Red Cross plans to use Aba as a main distribution point, when there are only 2300 tons of stockpiles at Port Harcourt and this supply port is separated from Aba (as we know from military intelligence) by a badly damaged road and perhaps the yet unbridged Imo River. Similarly, Calabar has low foodstocks and no major access to the enclave, which was our argument, after all, in rebuttal of charges on the Calabar-Ikom road being built by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>6. Move two C-97s in Tel Aviv to Cotonou for International Red Cross use and release all available C-97s in this country to the ICRD. Also we should urge the transfer of <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> aircraft to the Red Cross.</p>
                        <p>7. We should charter LSMs and offer them to the Nigerians with charter crews under Nigerian command.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d162-05" facs="d162-05"/>
                        <p>8. We should offer lighterage vessels on charter to the Nigerians to avoid further obstacles (in Port Harcourt and Calabar) which are a great potential bottleneck once the effort gets into gear. In this regard, we should urge <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> to turn over to us, for transmission to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, the five lighterage vessels it has at Sao Tome.</p>
                        <p>9. We should offer to Nigerian Red Cross or the Nigerian military light aircraft and small passenger helicopters which could be flown, if necessary, by chartered civilians. Here it may well be advisable at this early stage to make known our readiness to reopen our relationship with the Federal military in the wake of the war. Our Defense people in Lagos should be instructed to make every effort to get into the war zone to make their own reports on the issue of excesses as well as relief.</p>
                        <p>10. Call <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> home immediately, as the only high-level official with direct experience inside Biafra. (He should report to the President as a prelude to relieving Dave Newsom in our death (or life) watch in Lagos.)</p>
                        <p>11. Explore having Ethiopian Red Cross to offer its services to the Feds. We could play a role in flying the Ethiopians to Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>12. Planning: Commission a group of experienced Nigerian hands to look ahead of current operations at potential problems over the next six months to a year. This could include: former Ambassador Matthews (now at the Senior Seminar), <persName corresp="#p_MRM3">Roy Melbourne</persName> and Bob Smith (former Nigerian Desk men), Bob Barnard (our last Consul in Enugu and now in J/<gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>), Chris Beal, Chuck Hermann (formerly <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff, now Consultant from Princeton) and representatives from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. and <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> who had experience with Nigeria. This group could report directly to the Under Secretary, recommending actions to be taken now either to avoid trouble or start necessary action in order to be where we want to be in six months.</p>

                        <p>1. POLITICAL/MILITARY: A five-man Biafran peace delegation, including Sir Louis Mbanefo and Major General <persName corresp="#p_EMGP1">Effiong</persName>, arrived Lagos Jan. 14. At end of first round of talks with Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EMGP1">Effiong</persName> today issued statement accepting “the existing and federal structure of Nigeria” and affirming Ibo loyalty to Federal Government. He said “Republic of Biafra” no longer exists. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> responded with assurances <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will honor all guarantees offered to “our Eastern brothers”, including general amnesty.</p>
                        <p>Hostilities appear to have virtually ceased in war zone. Preliminary report from Canadian member International Observer Group, <pb n="2" xml:id="d163-02" facs="d163-02"/>which has just returned Lagos after inspection of southern sector, reconfirms yesterdayʼs British observer report that Federal Army and Nigerian Red Cross units have moved in quickly to feed refugees. Observer Group found no evidence atrocities having been committed by either side.</p>
                        <p>In statement released today in Geneva, former Biafran leader ODUMEGWU OJUKWU repeated his charges of genocide and urged those powers “who have armed and helped Nigeria” persuade <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> accept external aid offered to feed hungry. He asserted that Biafra had not lost war and it would survive. <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs whereabouts are still uncertain.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Sec-Gen <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> has appealed to <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> President Ahidjo reactivate Consultative Committee on Nigeria to help facilitate national reconciliation.</p>
                        <p>2. Relief: Federal Government issued statement late last night saying it “is contacting number of friendly governments on immediate requirements for relief in affected areas to supplement national effort.” (British Government has received request from <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> for provision of fifty Land Rovers, Fifty 5-ton and twenty 10-ton trucks, six 800-ton coastal <pb n="3" xml:id="d163-03" facs="d163-03"/>boats, and medical personnel and supplies. Half of the Land Rovers and 5-tonners may be sent by air.) <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> statement also blacklisted four governments and five relief agencies from whom further aid will not be accepted: France, Portugal, South Africa, Rhodesia, Joint Church Aid, Caritas, French Red Cross, Nordic Red Cross, and Canair. In addition, “all foreign relief workers who operated illegally in secessionist enclave” were declared persona non grata.</p>
                        <p>USG is continuing urgent consultations with <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> officials regarding our offers of emergency assistance and expects be informed of their specific requirements tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>According to statement issued yesterday in Geneva by LICROSS, Nigerian Red Cross teams are operating in almost all “liberated” areas, including Owerri, Aba, Umuahia, and Ikot Ekpene. Teams are expected arrive soon in heartland of former enclave--areas of Orliu, Oruta and Ihiala.</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> approval received, <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> plans airlift Danish Red Cross medical supplies to Nigeria. Two aircraft with combined capacity of 21 tons are being readied take off today.</p>

                        <p>The Princess de Bourbon has asked to see you tomorrow about Biafra. She flew out with <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, and has a message from him for the President. She has been appearing on European TV the last two days with her personal accounts of atrocities and mass starvation. She comes personally recommended by John Kenneth Galbraith and others.</p>
                        <p>Seeing the Princess could ruffle feelings in Lagos, but that should be manageable if we explain our dilemma to them in advance.</p>
                        <p>For if we refuse to see her, we will be refusing to hear at least an eye-witness account at a time when the President is deeply concerned and we have very little hard information.</p>
                        <p>On balance, I recommend you see her-- and that we inform TRUEHEART to tell the Feds we are doing so to avoid embarrassrnent to them as well as us.</p>

                        <p>C: This could be fine hour for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>K: Right</p>
                        <p>C: This is an opportunity to get at historical America, to unite the country. Could be done with blacks in this country too. Use imagination and involve both the public and private sector. Would suggest that when we see opportunity that the President convene private conference of heads of network and other media, foundations, peace corps, and army engineers to plan attack on problem. This could be even bigger than Hooverʼs plan after WWI. It should be combined rather than separate groups.</p>
                        <p>K: What should conference do?</p>
                        <p>C: Put challenge to media and relief agencies. Intensify the problem. Make clear what Government willing to do through peace corps and army engineers and ask them to join in effort. Would require about $50,000,000.</p>
                        <p>K: Would <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> let anything in?</p>
                        <p>C: The President could get <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to say yes. The French canʼt do anything but the British are doing quite a bit.</p>
                        <p>K: Should we do it in this way? Make it post-war reparations rather than relief?</p>
                        <p>C: Yes.</p>
                        <p>K: How would conference work in with Biafra?</p>
                        <p>C: Following invitation or agreement with Lagos.</p>
                        <p>K: When do you think we should call the conference?</p>
                        <p>C: 4-10 days from now.</p>
                        <p>K: I am convinced that we must make strong evaluation of moral concern and not just diplomatic problem. We canʼt just let these people die. The President agrees.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d165-02" facs="d165-02"/>
                        <p>C: Right</p>
                        <p>K: We have spent the better part of the day trying to find some mechanism to do this. Send me a telegram or letter, something quickly, with names of participants.</p>
                        <p>C: I would be willing to take a leave of absence to devote my full time to this. Iʼve had past experience at this sort of thing-- President <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> asked me to work on the ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p>
                        <p>K: When can you send me the list of participants?</p>
                        <p>C: _______days</p>
                        <p>K: This is very much on our minds.</p>
                        <p>C: This is a real opportunity for the President to improve access to certain groups in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>K: Frankly, the President hasnʼt been too concerned with that but he is greatly concerned with Biafra.</p>
                        <p>… who we would ask to do what and what we want to come out of this. We would want you to come down quickly.</p>
                        <p>C: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>K: Thank you and I appreciate this.</p>

                        <p>K: I had a call from <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Norman Cousins</persName> about Biafra. He felt you could gain prestige with groups you do not generally have access. He will help. I gave him a rundown on the weekend.</p>
                        <p>President: Was he pleased? Hope he knows that the State Department wasnʼt happy about that.</p>
                        <p>K: Yes, I told him. He thought that if you called a conference of private and governmental organizations, it would make a good impression.</p>
                        <p>President: After the State of the Union?</p>
                        <p>K: He thought next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>President: Fine. I want to be sure we take leadership on humanitarian problems. They are savages. I donʼt care about the anarchists, the Communists, the fascists. I have as little use for Hitler as for Stalin.</p>
                        <p>K: A lot of black groups say if we do something for Biafra</p>
                        <p>President: Ask <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>K: I will. <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> feels he can raise $50 million.</p>
                        <p>President: What about State?</p>
                        <p>K: <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> will carry the ball.</p>
                        <p>President: <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> should be in on it and it would strengthen him.</p>
                        <p>Donʼt worry about Gowon because he wants aid. If they donʼt play we donʼt have an Ambassador -- weʼll just take him out of there. And <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> better be careful because British arenʼt happy.</p>
                        <p>K: I will wait for <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Cousins</persName> proposal. Heʼs sending it by wire tonight. It will give you a lot of credit and standing with groups. You are going to get into major problems with safe guards.</p>
                        <p>I think we should have a Friday morning meeting on safeguards. Smith is difficult. He should plead. He thinks you are about to abandon.. .</p>

                            <item>CONDITIONS IN FORMER BIAFRAN ENCLAVE AS OF NOON JANUARY 15</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. THE BEST PICTURE WE CAN DRAW AT THIS POINT OF CONDITIONS IN FORMER ENCLAVE IS THIS:</p>
                        <p>A. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF MISBEHAVIOR OF FEDERAL TROOPS. THEY HAVE NOW BEEN ORDERED BACK TO BARRACKS AND SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNED TO POLICE.</p>
                        <p>B. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITY OR OTHER RESISTANCE BY REMNANTS OF BIAFRAN FORCES.</p>
                        <p>C. UNTIL THIS MORNING WE HAD NO EVIDENCE OF POCKETS CONTAINING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM <pb n="2" xml:id="d167-02" facs="d167-02"/>SERIOUS MALNUTRITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED FRAGMENTARY REPORT FROM BRITISH DOCTOR WITH RED CROSS TEAM WHICH REACHED ORLU (EAST OF ULI) JANUARY 13 INDICATING THAT CONDITIONS THERE ARE BAD WITH FOOD AND DRUGS URGENTLY NEEDED. “SEVERAL THOUSAND” PERSONS IN DESPERATE SHAPE. SEPARATE REPORT FOLLOWS ON THIS SITUATION. ACTION IS UNDER WAY TO BRING IN RELIEF. ELSEWHERE IN NEWLY RECOVERED AREAS RELIEF OPERATIONS AFFECTING SOME 250,000 PERSONS IN RELATIVELY GOOD CONDITION HAVE BEEN PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY.</p>
                        <p>D. ADEQUATE FOOD AND DRUG SUPPLIES ARE STOCKED AT POINTS ADJACENT TO FORMER ENCLAVE AND CAN BE REPLENISHED AS NECESSARY WITHOUT RESORT TO AIRLIFT. SUPPLIES IN HANDS RELIEF AGENCIES IN COUNTRY AND EN ROUTE SUFFICIENT FEED 2 MILLION PERSONS (20 PERCENT FULL FEEDING, 80 PERCENT PARTIAL) FOR TWO AND ONE-HALF MONTHS.</p>
                        <p>E. THERE IS REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORT AND VARIOUS STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO SUPPLY ADDITIONAL VEHICLES FROM LOCAL SOURCES AND FROM ABROAD, INCLUDING AIRLIFT. STILL OTHER VEHICLES MAY WELL RE NEEDED BUT REQUIREMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEFINED BY FMG. AT THIS POINT. HOWEVER, TRANSPORT SITUATION THOUGH SERIOUS IS NOT RPT NOT CRITICAL, IN SENSE OF INABILITY TO BRING FOOD TO THOSE KNOWN TO NEED IT.</p>
                        <p>2. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WEAKNESSES AND STRENGTHS OUR SOURCES OF INFORMATION: PRINCIPALLY RED CROSS TEAMS AND MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP. (WE ALSO HAVE OF COURSE INFORMATION FROM NIGERIAN SOURCES. WE DO NOT WISH TO IMPUGN LATTER BUT IT IS NOT BASIS FOR THIS REPORT.) AT PRESENT TIME RED CROSS TEAMS (WHICH ARE MADE UP ALMOST WHOLLY OF EXPATRIATE MEDICAL AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL) ARE CONVERGING ON HEART OF ENCLAVE, ENTERING IT FROM ENUGU AND ONITSHA AREA IN NORTH AND FROM OWERRI IN THE SOUTH. WE ARE CONFIDENT--AND THIS IS BORNE OUT BY ORLU REPORT--THAT ANY ADVERSE CONDITIONS, EITHER IN TERMS OF MALNUTRITION OR OBSTRUCTION OF RELIEF WORK, WILL BE PROMPTLY REPORTED BY THESE TEAMS AND WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, IF NOT BY NIGERIAN RED CROSS THEN BY AMERICAN ELEMENTS THEREOF. FOR EXAMPLE, PRINCIPAL MEDICAL ADVISOR TO RED CROSS DIRECTOR IN SOUTHERN AREA IS AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE DOCTOR. LAGOS HAS RADIO CONTACT WITH THESE TEAMS ONLY THROUGH <pb n="3" xml:id="d167-03" facs="d167-03"/>PORT HARCOURT AND ENUGU (AND SOON ABA AND OWERRI). HENCE SOME DELAY IN REPORTING IS INEVITABLE.</p>
                        <p>3. OUR SECOND MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP WHOSE FIRST REPORTS SINCE BIAFRAN COLLAPSE ARE JUST COMING IN. CONCLUSIONS ABOVE REFLECT JUST-CONCLUDED OBSERVER GROUP VISITS TO BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SECTORS OF FORMER WAR ZONE.</p>
                        <p>4. ALL-AMERICAN <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>/CF SURVEY BEGINS TOMORROW. IF THERE ARE NO LAST MINUTE HITCHES ON CLEARANCES. SURVEY TEAM WILL INCLUDE USAID PERSONNEL LAST ABOUT TWO WEEKS. THEY WILL BE COVERING ALL PARTS OF FORMER ENCLAVE AREA AND WILL BE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE BRIEF REPORTS OF FINDINGS WHENEVER THEY TOUCH POINTS WHERE COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE, PROBABLY EVERY OTHER DAY. I HAVE CONSIDERED BUT DECIDED AGAINST ATTACHING POLITICAL OFFICER TO TEAM BECAUSE THIS WOULD PROBABLY AROUSE SUSPICION AND COULD JEOPARDIZE SURVEY.</p>
                        <p>5. WE ARE NOT COMPLACENT ABOUT SITUATION AND HAVE BEEN AS PUZZLED AS THOSE OUTSIDE NIGERIA AT FAILURE UP UNTIL TODAY TO ENCOUNTER POCKETS OF SERIOUS MALNUTRITION. NEITHER RED CROSS NOR OBSERVER GROUP HAS COVERED ALL PARTS OF ENCLAVE, PARTICULARLY CENTRAL CORE BETWEEN OWERRI AND ONITSHA. THE REPORT JUST RECEIVED FROM ORLU SUGGESTS THAT RELIEF TEAMS MAY NOW BE GETTING INTO AREAS MOST SERIOUSLY AFFECTED. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUDGE DIMENSIONS OF PROBLEM BETTER WITHIN 48 HOURS.</p>
                        <p>6. THIS REPORT HAS CONCURRENCE ALL ELEMENTS THIS MISSION AND <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>/CF. IT ALSO ACCORDS WITH VIEWS BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER.<lb/>GP-3</p>

                        <p>R: There is to be a meeting of the Nigerian work group. Elliot tells me the President wants to do something. What is it?</p>
                        <p>K: Good question.</p>
                        <p>R: Have to be careful.. Gowan will be key in Africa. He is resentful of too much intrusion. As practical matter we cannot do anything he doesnʼt want. We donʼt want to be in that posture. I want to say we agree and tell them whatever he wants to use, we will help. He did not like military people flying planes in.</p>
                        <p>K: I understand. Because of reasons, the President wants leadership in domestic areas.</p>
                        <p>R: I could issue a press release</p>
                        <p>K: Forming up what we have done this week. That would be helpful. He just called on the State of the Union but wanted to know what is being done in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>R: A lot</p>
                        <p>K: If you could prepare a release, that would be best.</p>
                        <p>R: We must put it in a way not to get in trouble with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. He thinks relief prolonged the war.</p>
                        <p>K: Probably right</p>
                        <p>R: We will see what we can do.</p>
                        <p>K: The latest figure from Lucet is 110. I asked him about a break down. He just hemmed. They donʼt make it easy to be pro-French.</p>
                        <p>R: I saw Zieglerʼs item on my speech. I just re-stated that I had said before</p>
                        <p>K: The President heard it last night and wanted the press to be sure it was understood. Zeigler wanted to confirm</p>
                        <p>R: Itʼs the same as my testimony.</p>
                        <p>-----------further conversation in evening</p>
                        <p>R: Following up on Nigeria. There will be a draft press release on what has been done this week. During the weekend we expect to fly in 50 jeeps for relief.</p>

                        <p>K: Can we announce that?</p>
                        <p>R: Yes. We have asked permission from <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>K: Exactly what the President wanted to do.</p>
                        <p>R: <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> is coming back on Monday. Perhaps the three of us could meet with the President and release that I am going to Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>K: He may not want to announce it. But you should be there. He may be going back to Camp David to work on the State of the Union.</p>
                        <p>R: I will try to have tomorrow formalizing <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName>ʼs committee. Then another one Sunday. Then after <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> can announce about medicines and such.</p>
                        <p>K: What about the Brandt visit. We should tell the Germans itʼs to enable you to be there.</p>
                        <p>R: SEATO meeting</p>
                        <p>K: Do you think that you will skip Saigon?</p>
                        <p>R: Saigon and then Phillipines and then back here for Brandt visit.</p>

                        <p>The group which called on Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> was composed of two Irish priests recently evacuated from the enclave and two Americans who have been associated with the “Biafran lobby” in the U.S. The purpose of their call was to lodge a complaint against the USGʼs alleged “do-nothing” response to the crisis resulting from the Biafran collapse. Their concern centered on two contentions: (1) that an immediate airlift of foodstuffs was necessary to prevent mass starvation; and (2) that the USG was sanguinely endorsing <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> propaganda regarding emergency relief efforts.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of first-hand impressions froth the Holy Ghost Fathers and deductions based on information from other “sources”, the group stressed that the food situation in the heartland of the former enclave must have reached desperate proportions. They asserted that any existing food caches in the area would have been emptied in a matter of minutes. Given the factors of pilferage, corruption, etc., they asked how much food could actually have reached those in need by surface transport. They contended that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> was issuing inflated statistics on the amount of food stockpiled near the enclave. The two priests reported seeing huge numbers of refugees fleeing northward into the Uli-Orlu area and said that the arrival of 100 tons of food in Orlu was ludicrously short of the requirements. It was preposterous, they said, to claim that two feeding stations at Owerri and Aba could replace the missionariesʼ network of 1200 feeding centers.
<pb n="2" xml:id="d169-02" facs="d169-02"/>Reference was made to the alarming situation uncovered by Dr. Western (a USPHS member of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs team) last November. Mr. Beal asserted that logical deduction could only lead to the conclusion that the situation had seriously worsened since then. It was pointed out that a high percentage of the people were suffering from edema, a condition which would almost certainly go unnoticed by a layman observer.</p>
                        <p>The group conceded that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> might have the worthiest of motives, but seriously doubted that the Nigerian Red Cross (NRC) could respond effectively to the new challenge, since the NRC had failed to do an adequate job in the past in Federally-controlled territory. Given the magnitude of the feeding problem, they insisted that an immediate airlift was the only answer, particularly to reach bush areas between Okigwi and Awka which purportedly were unreachable by road. It was suggested that the USG should use every means at its disposal to convince the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to use the long--established Holy Ghost Fathers distribution network and to airlift supplies into Uli and other airstrips in the former enclave.</p>
                        <p>The USG was accused of being complacent in the face of what was obviously a desperate situation. Mr. Orick specifically criticized members of the Nigeria Working Group, who he said had given him via phone overly-optimistic situation reports based on unsubstantiated “facts”.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> emphasized that the USG shared their deep concern for the welfare of the people in the former enclave. He summarized the impressions gained from his recent trip to Lagos, to the effect that he had found no reason to doubt the sincerity of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and nothing to substantiate the earlier spate of allegations regarding genocide and mass starvation. He pointed out that responsibility for public order was passing from the military to the police, that when the fighting stopped refugees began to flow southward, and that medical/relief teams including many expatriates were reportedly moving cuickly into the area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stressed the importance of Nigerian control of relief efforts in the interest of national reconciliation. He assured the group that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> had indicated a willingness to accept outside assistance as needed, but that the Nigerian authorities would not be dictated to and would make their own assessment of their requirements. He said that the USG did not want to “gild the lily” regarding NRC efficiency, but neither did we want to impede the promising start already made by an over-exertion of “pressure.”</p>
                        <p>He emphasized that the most immediate need was for hard facts from on-the-scene observers, such as newsmen, members of the medical/relief teams, and Lord Hunt. Until this type of information became available in greater quantity the USG, he said, could only reserve judgement regarding the gravity of the situation and the Nigerian response. He reiterated that all of the preliminary reports and assessments had been encouraging and that there was no basis for “exerting pressure” in the absence of up-to-date facts.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d169-03" facs="d169-03"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> remarked that, despite formal statements to the contrary, it appeared that the former Biafran distribution apparatus would continue to be utilized, at least during the current emergency phase of operations. He suggested that the Holy Ghost Order might want to use the good offices of Irish Ambassador Keating in Lagos as an appropriate channel to appeal to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> for continuing use of the missionaries in the relief efforts.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A is a State Department appraisal of the situation in Nigeria and a run-down of present and proposed actions. The State report illustrates all too clearly the very serious problems we face -- both in the realities of the situation and bureaucratically here -- in dealing with this tragedy.</p>
                        <p>The main points of the State memo -- set beside updated information or relevant facts State did not explain -- are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. State says Nigerian relief is “progressing reasonably well” and first-hand reports indicate a return to “normal”. But: Several eyewitness reports so far (Tab B) report “critical” conditions. One American doctor just out of Biafra says one million could die in the next three weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. State says the International Observers toured the war zone and bear out optimism. But: The observer team got only to the fringe of the enclave, travelling behind Federal troops. Thus they were separated from the mass of the fleeing Biafrans. And, as they have admitted publicly, they were not qualified medically to judge the relatively few people they saw.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has turned down any increase in the observers. So far, we have no evidence of military atrocities.</p>
                        <p>3. State says we are sending in an urgent “survey team” to assess the need. <pb n="2" xml:id="d170-02" facs="d170-02"/>But: The Federals prohibited our teamʼs travel to the affected area over the weekend. They were given permission to go in today, but are still not clear on permission to examine the area in detail.</p>
                        <p>4. State reports a series of U.S. actions, including a distribution of funds and a Nigerian request for 50 jeeps which is yet unconfirmed. But: Though the Nigerians requested the 50 jeeps and 50 trucks today, the hard fact is that after your offer one week ago, no significant U.S. aid is yet flowing into Nigeria, and least of all into the starving area. The prospects are that the Nigerians will ask us only for marginal items such as small vehicles or generators. Our actions thus far sum up to readiness, not results.</p>
                        <p>State concludes that we must continue to observe Nigerian sensitivities about running relief themselves, and thus avoid pressing “unneeded” aid. This means, in effect, leaving the job to the Nigerian Red Cross relying solely on trucking in locally stored food.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Case for Action</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The facts on the magnitude of the need -- which underlie our reliance on the Nigerians -- are fundamentally in dispute. During October and November, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> sent a special U.S. relief survey team into Biafra. The team was led by Dr. Karl Western, an expert from our Atlanta Communicable Diseases Center. Dr. Westernʼs findings -- and his resulting analysis this week of the current crisis --argue that State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and the Nigerians are grossly underestimating the emergency. The Western Report is the only scientific survey made of conditions inside Biafra. All other figures, on which State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> are planning, are estimates from the outside.</p>
                        <p>The most vital factors in the crisis bear on two judgments: (a) how much food is necessary for how many people, and (b) the objective ability of the Nigerians to handle the need, as they claim. The findings of Dr. Western (and nearly all other eyewitnesses) compare the State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> position as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The Food Need</p>
                        <p>-- State, working on reports from our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> mission in Lagos and “Nigerian estimates, plans on 2, 000 tons needed per week to feed less than a million starving people.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d170-03" facs="d170-03"/>
                        <p>Dr. Western and others found:</p>
                        <p>- between 3 and 4 million in Biafra, of whom nearly half require full rations just to survive while the rest need 500-600 calories to stave off starvation edema. This means 6,000 to 10, 000 tons per week (<persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> estimates at least 13, 000 tons).</p>
                        <p>- although State and the Nigerian plans rely on local foods, the exhaustion or devastation of fertile areas -- plus the fact that January-March are the worst agricultural months anyway --mean far too little local food available.</p>
                        <p>- while State and Nigerian plans (2, 000 tons) are based on how much food Biafra was getting by airlift, the mass social disruption of the collapse plus the deterioration Biafrans were experiencing even with the airlift (which goes to explain the military collapse) argue that the needy will not be saved by the old 2, 000 ton figure.</p>
                        <p>- While Nigerians (and State) have pointed to initial observer reports of good condition, historical experience with famine (e.g. The Western Netherlands in 1945, The Irish Potato Famine) indicates fragmentary reports are unreliable and first estimates of need are always very deficient.</p>
                        <p>2. The Ability of the Nigerians</p>
                        <p>-- State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> think the Nigerians seem able to meet the need. Dr. Western and others, who worked on the Federal side as well, contend:</p>
                        <p>- the past history of the Nigerian relief effort is not hopeful. One estimate charged that only 15% of the food available actually got through over several months last year.</p>
                        <p>- The Nigerian relief teams are already strained to feed 500, 000 needy behind the old Federal lines. They cannot abandon that half-million. Even if they did, the 19 Nigerian teams are at a ratio of 1 relief worker per 4, 000 needy Biafrans. Training for new workers is slow and an untrained volunteer does more harm than good.</p>
                        <p>- Though they have more than 200 trucks available or on the way, the Nigerians cannot organize the kind of truck-lift <pb n="4" xml:id="d170-04" facs="d170-04"/>it takes to get in anything close to 6, 000 tons a week. In the nine days since Biafra has been without outside relief, we have reports of only 140 tons going in by truck.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Western and his colleagues are willing to put their reputations on the line in the objective judgement that some portion of 1 to 1.5 million Biafrans will probably die of starvation or disease in the next two weeks unless there is a massive injection of high protein food into the area of greatest need. This means precisely the round-the-clock airlift into Biafra which the Feds proudly argue is “unnecessary” (and which State is advising not to suggest).</p>
                        <p>The Bureaucratic Positions</p>
                        <p>State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> have long discredited eyewitness accounts from Biafra, on the grounds of pro-Biafra “bias” among relief workers. That charge hardly applies to Dr. Western (our own objective expert), yet present planning somehow presumes Dr. Western cannot be right. The Western Report has been available to the bureaucracy for 6 weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> probably disregards the Western Report because it proves them so far wrong. State finds Westernʼs data unpalatable because it points to a show-down with Nigeria. Thus the disparity between Stateʼs policy this week and the clear dictates of Westernʼs analysis.</p>
                        <p>No one will ever know conclusively the facts of the Biafran tragedy. The war, the chaos, the terrain make that impossible. But given the human stakes and the scientific weight of the Western survey, the presumption must be in favor of greater need -- rather than the opposite. The price of under-estimating -- when we have expert opinion to the contrary -- could be millions of dead.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Domestic Political Problem</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a good possibility of a storm gathering here, ready to break as soon as the first reports of mass need hit the papers (as they will when reporters get out of Lagos and into the area). Your quick moves last weekend signalled recognition of need and urgent response. State has spent the past week saying (a) we donʼt know the need, (b) the Nigerians can handle the problem, and (c) in any case, we wonʼt push them.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> is holding hearings this coming week. Senator Goodell and others will be giving press conferences. Catholic, Protestant and <pb n="5" xml:id="d170-05" facs="d170-05"/>Jewish groups are reported planning national appeals for action. The bipartisan pressure on this issue is likely to revive quickly. Catherine Menninger (Dr. Menningerʼs wife) has already referred to the Western Report in the Post, and the pursuit of that subject could be explosive.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Necessity for Decision</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Time will not make the Nigerians less proud or more cognizant of a need which requires scientific rigor to perceive. Even if our survey team leaves tomorrow, it will take days to “prove” Western and other eye-witnesses are wrong. If the need is massive, the moment when our decision will affect the saving of lives is now fleeting.</p>
                        <p>There is no prospect that others will act first. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> did not report it in his cables, but he told my staff privately last night that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> told him he expects at least a half-million deaths. The British, <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> reports, are deeply cynical about this problem and are as unwilling to push the Federals now as during the war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> were briefed orally today by Dr. Western and his team, and the facts seem finally to have sunk in. State reports it is moving to approach the Federals. They will do so, however, still in a low-key, and we do not have the luxury of time for gradual persuasion.</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians may balk despite our evidence, but we must convey it quickly and powerfully to protect your position in the likelihood of further disaster.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you instruct an immediate approach to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> in strong terms to present the potential disaster and a proposal for an immediate airlift into the severely affected area.</p>

                        <list type="subject">
                            <head>Subject:</head>
                            <item>Nigeria</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This memorandum summarizes the present situation in Nigeria as well as US actions under way and in prospect.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Present Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Evidence from the field, while still fragmentary, indicates that the Federal Government is taking a conciliatory and magnanimous approach to reintegration of the former rebels, that the relief program is progressing reasonably well, and that fighting has virtually ended. Reliable first-hand reports on conditions in some parts of the Biafran enclave are now becoming available and nearly all report the relief effort functioning, no evidence of atrocities, and the beginnings of a return to normal life.</p>
                        <p>The International Observer group (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Canadians, Swedish, Polish, <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives established by the Federal Government in 1968) has just made a tour of a limited part of the war zone, including the former Biafran capital of Owerri, and its report bears out other observers. While the sudden military collapse and administrative breakdown have created a mass feeding requirement, the most serious problem will arise if large numbers of Ibos flee into the bush out of fear, and are inaccessible to relief teams. Reports on the extent of this problem are <pb n="7" xml:id="d170-07" facs="d170-07"/>inconclusive but our own survey team in the field should provide us with more precise information in the next few days.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relief</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The emergency high-protein stockpile in Nigeria and nearby ports, 24,000 tons, should meet for at least the next 30 days anticipated requirements on the basis of the <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> Mission survey in the enclave in October. Another 10,000 tons is due to arrive before the end of February and additional stocks can be diverted to Nigeria as necessary. We will know in the next few days, from field surveys, whether stocks need further augmentation.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is in process of developing detailed plans for meeting its further relief needs. It has rejected help from what it regards as hostile sources, but will levy over coming days requests on the United States and other sources, as it already has on the British. The Nigerians are determined to run their own relief effort and control outside contributions. They will not accept military aircraft or personnel, but will probably ask us for medical supplies and pre-packaged hospitals, surface transport, and perhaps bridge materials.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">US Actions in Progress</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Given Nigerian sensitivities, we are making clear in all our actions that we seek to respond to Nigerian requests to help meet the actual need, that we are not seeking to force unneeded assistance on them, and that we are continuing to consult closely with them in order to be as helpful as possible.</p>
                        <p>The range of actions we are taking, some of which have been made public, in addition to the offer of C-130 transport aircraft and four helicopters you have made, and the $10 million you have made available for emergency relief, includes the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Relief</p>
                        <p>1. Financial Assistance</p>
                        <p>$2 million of your $10 million offer has already <pb n="8" xml:id="d170-08" facs="d170-08"/>been provided to the Nigerian Red Cross via the League of Red Cross Societies for local food purchase or other desired use.</p>
                        <p>2. Airlift</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians have under consideration our offer to airlift up to four packaged disaster hospitals by commercial air and we expect a response shortly. They have asked for 50 jeeps for transport of relief team personnel which we will send by commercial airlift as soon as they agree to shipment. In addition, we have made arrangements for charter of commercial C-130s if required.</p>
                        <p>3. UNICEF</p>
                        <p>We have pledged $2 million for such projects as Executive Director Labouisse determines during his present trip to Lagos.</p>
                        <p>4. Field Personnel</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, US Public Health, and American Red Cross are making available relief and medical personnel and stand ready to add to these as needed.</p>
                        <p>5. C-97 Transport</p>
                        <p>Two of the four US-supplied <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> C-97s at Cotonou and the four <gloss target="#t_JCA1">JCA</gloss> C-97s at Sao Tome are immediately available if required. Four reserve C-97s in the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>S are being readied by the Air Force against possible need.</p>
                        <p>6. Local Shipping</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has procured three vessels in Nigeria in addition to those in operation or being procured by the relief agencies, the British and the Dutch. Four US LCMs (30-50 ton capacity) are arriving at Lagos on January 19. US funds are available to the Nigerian Red Cross for charter of local lighterage.</p>
                        <p>7. Aircraft</p>
                        <p>US funds are being made available to the Nigerian Red Cross for charter of light aircraft, if needed. <pb n="9" xml:id="d170-09" facs="d170-09"/>We have located and can make available on request commercial helicopters.</p>
                        <p>8. Relief Survey</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs professional survey team including doctors, as well as relief and logistic experts, is today leaving Lagos for the war zone to provide us a first-hand appraisal of conditions and needs.</p>
                        <p>B. Security</p>
                        <p>1. Information on Conditions</p>
                        <p>In order to meet public concern, a fuller flow of objective first-hand information is required. We are seeking to obtain information from the Nigerian Police (now responsible for security in the enclave). We are urging the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to permit freer movement of newspaper reporters into the war zone. We have proposed to <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> that he visit the war zone during his visit to Lagos. In addition to the <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> survey team, we have asked the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> urgently to send US Government observers into the area.</p>
                        <p>2. International Observer Team</p>
                        <p>We are working with the Canadians and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to persuade the Nigerian Government to expand the ten-man International Observer group at least to its former strength of 17 and if possible to a larger number.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Recommendations:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are making a major effort to assure full public understanding of the contributions the US is making to assist the Nigerians in meeting their problems. I therefore propose that you consider the following steps:</p>
                        <p>1. That you receive Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> (returning this weekend from consultations with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and with relief agencies in Europe) and <pb n="10" xml:id="d170-10" facs="d170-10"/>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> (returning tonight from Lagos) on Monday for a first-hand report on their activities.</p>
                        <p>Approve________ Disapprove_________</p>
                        <p>2. That the White House issue a statement tomorrow detailing those actions the United States is taking which can be made public and announcing that <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> will be reporting to you. We hope clearance will be received from the Nigerians in time to include the announcement that we are airlifting 50 jeeps to Lagos. A proposed draft of this statement will be provided to you tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Approve________ Disapprove_________</p>
                        <p>3. That a further White House statement be issued on Monday following your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> reporting any further US actions at that time. The Nigerians may have agreed by then to an airlift of packaged disaster hospitals, which can then be included in that statement. A draft will be provided on Monday.</p>
                        <p>Approve________ Disapprove_________</p>
                        <p>4. That you consider issuing the latter part of next week a statement addressing the need for immediate relief and rehabilitation in Nigeria and pledging a substantial US contribution for this purpose. This requires prior consultations with the Nigerian Government and the World Bank, which are now being undertaken. A specific proposal will be submitted at a later date.</p>
                        <p>Approve________ Disapprove_________</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You have a detailed run-down on the immediate problem in meeting emergency relief needs. (A copy of this memo is at Tab A for easy reference.)</p>
                        <p>The problem in brief is that State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, as well as the Nigerians, have (a) seriously underestimated the food requirements in terms of tonnages and people in severe need, while (b) overestimating the ability of the Nigerians to cope. For various reasons, our people here and in Lagos have refused to accept an authoritative factual survey done by U.S. public health doctors in Biafra just before the collapse -- the Western Report, named after Dr. Karl Western of the Atlanta Communicable Diseases Center who led the team. Following a personal briefing by Dr. Western and his colleagues today, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> have at least begun necessary action by instructing our mission in Lagos to try to persuade the Nigerians of the serious implications of the Western Report.</p>
                        <p>State will argue in this meeting that we must go slow in pointing out the Nigeriansʼ error. The hard truth, however, is that we do not have the luxury of time for a low-key selling job. According to Dr. Western and his colleagues, the food situation in Biafra now is like a precipice, with large numbers of people dropping over everyday. The need must be recognized quickly and acted upon, or the mass damage will be done.</p>
                        <p>Your purpose in this meeting should be to impress upon State the urgency of presenting the situation to the Nigerians. This means not only an effort by our embassy in Lagos to convey the problem, but also a strong political push to protect your position should the Nigerians -- as they well may -- still refuse to act. This means pressing for an emergency airlift.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d171-02" facs="d171-02"/>
                        <p>Talking Points</p>
                        <p>1. There is strong evidence that we face a very serious problem in Nigerian relief. Our own scientific survey of food needs inside Biafra -- the Western Report -- indicates the problem is likely to be much greater than the Nigerians have anticipated or are able to deal with.</p>
                        <p>2. (Ask) <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Clyde Ferguson</persName> to outline the relief problem, including the major implications of the Western Report.</p>
                        <p>3. (Ask) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> (on the basis of his trip to Lagos) to assess the political situation -- how we should approach the Nigerians to have maximum impact both in persuading them to move and in protecting your position if they do not and there are mass deaths.</p>
                        <p>4. Given the sensitivity of this problem, we should avoid commenting to the Press after this meeting. I want to reflect further on my decision in dealing with the Nigerians.</p>

                        <p>P: Did I catch you while you are seeing Cabot? No, thatʼs all right, you can talk. Two things: One, I mentioned to him my conversation with Benelli. I want him to understand we will fight the new opening to the left. I want him to fight that there. I am sure of Martin but I think the others are cutting us up.</p>
                        <p>K: I agree or why would Benelli have brought that up?</p>
                        <p>P: On the Africa thing, it seems to me <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> and the others are convinced that we have to deal with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. That heʼs powerful. Do you think so?</p>
                        <p>K: Thatʼs their view. The problem as I see it is first of all, in the press statement they already read one sentence</p>
                        <p>P: I thought that had already gone out</p>
                        <p>K: Not yet. Have to say determination because in a month it will be apparent that over a million people are dying of starvation.</p>
                        <p>P: The only problem is this. When I think of the whole business of having a meeting of these people and the rest, that we have <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> go along with it.</p>
                        <p>K: I am not sure we should have a White House conference.</p>
                        <p>P: I donʼt know if it will come off. Weʼve already shown enough interest. Let <persName corresp="#p_CN3">Norman Cousins</persName> take it up with the State Department.</p>
                        <p>K: If there is a huge amount of starvation, I want you protected. Youʼve done much</p>
                        <p>P: If they are bleeding and dying</p>
                        <p>K: Did you see the memo on Biafra I left with you this morning? I would go easy on the White House conference for at least a few days.</p>
                        <p>P: I will put that on a back burner for at least a few days. Itʼs a savage situation. I think they are going to starve them. I think State knows it and <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> knows it.</p>
                        <p>K: <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> said over 500 thousand are going to die.</p>
                        <p>P: I think they donʼt give a damn. They think itʼs Africa and thatʼs the way it will be. Bill made the practical point that we cannot do what they donʼt want us to do.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d172-02" facs="d172-02"/>
                        <p>K: Every hot item gets shuttled into the White House but State gets credit for all the good</p>
                        <p>P: We havenʼt had any disagreements with State offer this have we?</p>
                        <p>K: Oh, yes, everything that has been done in the past week has been done with <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> pressure. I donʼt think we can do a great deal more. I would eliminate that one sentence. It looks callous. Other than that, I have no problems with it. The White House conference can go on the back burner. It might get you points with some people not normally for you</p>
                        <p>P: Strange isnʼt it? Those who usually are liberals would let Nigeria starve. They just figure that most important thing…</p>
                        <p>K: I thought you might like to know that at the meeting with the Chinese in Warsaw they have insisted on news media. Itʼs unprecedented. You know, itʼs in their Embassy. They must be scared out of their minds of the Russians.</p>
                        <p>P: I hope something happens between us. Hope no battle on Biafra with State. We have to fight ABM. Len Garment sent me a memo. Favorable and unfavorable. I talked with <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> and told him that they are catering to the wrong people. They are willing to tear up the society.</p>
                        <p>K: The people to whom you are appealing will not respect you for it.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Background</p>
                        <p>During your meeting with the President on how we are meeting the immediate post-war relief needs in Nigeria, you will be accompanied by myself and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>. He is just back from meetings with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, with other governments and with relief agencies in Europe. Our information is still spotty about the condition of those in tho Biafran enclave. However, a number of observers including Hendrick Beer of LICROSS and Lord Hunt, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>ʼs Relief Coordinator, have travelled through the area and at least we have ther impressions. We do not yet have actual reports of nutritional experts who can determine accurately the actual degree of starvation. Appearances can be deceiving. USPHS experts formerly in the enclave believe as latent feeding problem of large proportions still exists.</p>
                        <p>What does seem clear is that, so far, the former Biafrans, both civilian and military, are being correctly and humanely treated by the Nigerians. We should have a much clearer picture of current conditions as soon as the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>/CF team we have dispatched to the area files its report.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that in your discussion with the President you highlight the actions we have taken so far, and emphasize that we can only do what the Nigerians will permit us to do.</p>
                        <p>Our contingency planning at an early stage permitted us to pre-position large quantities of food to meet the emergency. The figures provided to the White House Staff January 19 however, (by Dr. Western of USPHS who surveyed the enclave in October 196) are four times as high as the original USPHS (Western) figures derived from the Ootober survey and 50 percent above last weekʼs USPHS projection of 6000 tons per week. Our planned food supply would meet the 6000 ton USPHS figure. The following decisions however, would be needed to insure meeting the new, 50 percent higher USPHS figures of 9000 tons:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d173-02" facs="d173-02"/>
                        <p>a) Immediate diversion to Nigeria of 10,000 tons of high protein food scheduled for other countries.</p>
                        <p>b) Contingency planning for a very large (up to 50 large jet transports) airlift to Nigeria in the first half of February to prevent a temporary short fall of 5-10,000 tons it the diversion were postponed.</p>
                        <p>Whether to take these decisions, based on the new USPHS analysis, which is not supported by current field recommendations, depends on your concern to guard against any possible shortfall (see Tab D). It will require, in any event, obtaining agreement of the experts in the field, and the concurrence of the Nigerian Government which has asserted publicly that present and planned food supplies are fully adequate.</p>
                        <p>This discussion does not address itself to the question of internal distribution of such greatly increased supply which, we are told, would perhaps require aninternal airlift of a kind the Nigerians have so far rejected.</p>
                        <p>The visits of Ambassador Ferguson Bill Brubeck to Europe and my my own visit to Lagos helped us to stay on top of developments and to concert our actions, at the highest levels, with other governments and organizations. The activation of the Interagency Supervisory Group coordinated by the Under Secretary to provide guidance at the top level of governmont, and the establishment of the Nigeria Working Group enabled us to deal with the immediate and fast-moving, post-war situation with a maximum of flexibility and speed. The immediate actions directed by these groups to meet the problem are listed at Tab E.</p>
                        <p>However, we must approach the question of how best to help meet the relief problem with full realization of Nigerian sensitivity to what it considers excessive outside interference. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his Government are publicly committed to decent treatment and re-integration of the Ibos. However, he and his government are determined to be seen to be doing this themselves. They want to make it very clear to the Ibos that relief is coming to them from Nigerians, and not from outsiders. Consequently, as far as the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is concerned, the relief effort is a Nigerian one which will draw on outside offers of assistance only to the extent it feels this to be necessary. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his Government are resentful at outside pressures, particularly on the part of those they consider to have assisted the rebellion. Some of this feeling has spilled over onto us because of our help to relief agencies in Biafra. The Nigerians doubly resent what they consider to be the racist assumption on the part of the Western world that black men cannot run their own affairs and cannot solve their own problems. Our attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> in the next few weeks will be important to our longer term relations with Africaʼs most populous nation.</p>

                        <p rend="center">TAB A<lb/>SITUATION REPORT</p>
                        <p>In the week since the collapse of resistance to the Federal military a series of observers have reported on the situation in the former enclave. Extensive trips were made on January 17-18 by Heinrich Beer of the League of Red Gross Societies (LICROSS) to -- Port Harcourt, Aba, Umudike, Uiavahia, Ikot Expene, Overri, Orlu, Awomama and Uli -- and Lord Hunt, British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>ʼs special representative, to Owerri, Uli and Orlu with many stops enroute. Beer concluded that there were small pockets of need but no large scale major problem. He found reports of large numbers of refugees thought to have taken refuge in the bush to have been exaggerated. He also noted many instances of Biafran self-help and no sign of resistance or excesses by the victors.</p>
                        <p>Lord Hunt also found the overall picture encouraging, with the NRC active in alleviating bad conditions as soon as they were discovered. His general impression was that the refugees he encountered were in fair physical condition with only a small percentage suffering from serious malnutrition. The elderly and the wounded were in the greatest need of medical assistance. In side trips to the bush, he also noted, life was returning to normal. At a number of hospitals he visited, there were shortages of doctors and some patients had fled to the bush. Some expatriate doctors had remained, however, and the Nigerian Red Cross (NRC) was moving energetically to bring immediate assistance. According to Hunt, the Federal military was extending help to refugees and feeding them in ad hoc transit camps. However, there were allegations that third division troops had engaged in looting, rape and requisitioning of some Red Cross vehicles. Hunt could only verify the vehicle requisitioning. He commented that he was impressed by fraternization between federal troops and the civilian population and did not believe troop misbehavior was general. Finally, Hunt noted that the refugee camps were emptying rapidly as large numbers of Ibos were returning to their homes.</p>
                        <p>Reports earlier in the week by John Clare, a reporter for the Times of London, the military observer group, and Dr. George Hobbs, a British NRC area medical advisor, also corroborate the picture painted by Hunt and Beer, Glare noted Federal military efforts to help civilians. He belied the main needs were drugs, clothes and money, not staple foods which he found available locally. The observer group which visited the first and third division areas of Eastern Nigeria January 10-14 reported that, <pb n="5" xml:id="d173-05" facs="d173-05"/>with the exception of Owerri, the refugees they saw appeared to be in good physical shape. Federal troops were carrying food where it was most needed and roads in the area visited were in good condition. Neither the military observer group, Clare nor HOBBS had noted any excesses on the parts of Federal troops. Nor was any resistance by former Biafran soldiers discovered.</p>
                        <p>The reports of outside observers we have in hand now cover virtually all of the Ibo heartland and the southern portion of the Arochuku salient (the Eastern third of the former enclave). The area north of Arochuku is the only one which has clearly not been visited although we also lack specific data on the region between Umuahia and Owerri. Briefly conditions in major areas are as follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Uli-Orlu area:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Food - staples on hand - earlier shortage in Orlu being relieved by arrivals of trucked supplies - NRC meeting to arrange an increase in food stocks - Hunt favors an airlift to Uli, though he recognizes <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> objections, but Siad Mohamed and Beer of NRC do not agree that such a move is necessary.</p>
                        <p>b. Relief workers - Federal government is utilizing expatriate and Ibo relief workers - a relief team is located at Okigwi, teams are expected soon in Orlu Oguta and Ihiala and the NRC is organizing additional teams to work in the area.</p>
                        <p>c. Roads - The Onitsha-Owerri road is reported open - roads to Orlu are open.</p>
                        <p>d. Hospitals - Military hospitals in bad condition - civilian hospitals suffering a shortage doctors and personnel but have limited supplies, drugs and food - 1,000 kwashiokor cases found - 800 of 1150 children evacuated to Port Harcourt - Orlu hospital in good condition.</p>
                        <p>e. General - Refugees returning to towns with food - refugee camps emptying and refugees heading south and west across Niger River to former homes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Owerri-Aba</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Food - local supplies are satisfactory in both Aba and Owerri area - 105,000 refugees are being fed in Aba.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d173-06" facs="d173-06"/>
                        <p>b. Relief workers - an Australian relief team is present in Owerri.</p>
                        <p>c. Roads - good condition - bridges had been repaired on Owerri-Aba road.</p>
                        <p>d. Hospitals - a package hospital is expected to arrive soon in Port Harcourt for trans-shipment to Aba - 800 cases of kwashiokor have been found; 2000 are expected - Santana hospital south of Owerri being operated by Nigerian army.</p>
                        <p>e. General - most refugees are in good shape - some refugees in Owerri suffering from malnutrition - many on roads evidently returning home.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Umuahia - Umudike</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Food - adequate in one large refugee camp meager in another but refugees in both in good condition.</p>
                        <p>b. Relief workers - relief teams present in Umuahia - refugee camps are well run.</p>
                        <p>c. Roads - reported in extremely good condition.</p>
                        <p>d. Hospitals - no new information - a pre-packaged hospital to arrive at Port Harcourt is destined for Umuahia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Ikot Ekpene - Arochuku</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The area was visited by the team of foreign military observers and by Beer of LICROSS who presumably took local conditions into account in making their overall assessment of the relief situation.</p>
                        <p>A Quaker relief team is located in Arochuku. Another NRC team is in Ikot Ekpene</p>

                        <p>Attached is a memorandum from a member of my staff, which argues that there will soon be increasing public evidence both of famine in the former Biafran enclave and of failure by the Nigerian Government adequately to deal with it. He bases his argument on the Western Report, written by a team of Public Health doctors from the Atlanta Communicable Diseases Center. He believes that this will lead to increasingly serious political problems here.</p>
                        <p>I have talked to Dr. Western and his associates and find their evidence persuasive. It indicates that 1 to 1-1/2 million people are in danger of dying from starvation or epidemics over the next three weeks. Several Senators and public figures have already called about the situation. This reaction will grow. It is interesting to note that both the Right (Bill Buckley and Congressman Lukens) and the Left (Senators Goodell, <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>, et al) are united in arguing that America is not doing its duty on this problem.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have seen your account of the noon meeting today with the President on Nigeria. I must re-emphasize the point of your recent memorandum to the President (attached). The President may be sitting on a political time-bomb. Our only chance to protect him, and to save a million or more lives, is to move decisively and urgently in pressing the Nigerians.</p>
                        <p>The only authoritative survey of famine in Biafra -- the Western Report, done by a team of our Public Health doctors from Atlanta --tells us that 1 to 1-1 /2 million Biafrans will be dying over the next 2-3 weeks unless there is a massive injection of high-protein food. This means (a) 3-4 times as much food as State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and the Nigerians now plan to put in, and (b) an emergency airlift into Biafra, which both the Nigerians and State say is unnecessary. The State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and Nigerian plans were not based on a scientific on-the-spot survey of the need, but rather estimates made outside Biafra.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Western and his colleagues (who worked in the Federal Relief Program last fall as well as in Biafra):</p>
                        <p>-- have documented in a thorough study of historical famines that all eye-witness accounts have been seriously inaccurate in such cases in the past. They contend that in the Nigerian case, as in every recorded famine in modern history, initial observer reports have vastly under-estimated the magnitude of the problem.</p>
                        <p>-- conclude, with the same scientific authority, that the Nigerians cannot conceivably cope with the starvation upon them. There is no question of their good intentions. But they do not understand the size and urgency of their task, and they lack the people or equipment to deal with it.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d174-03" facs="d174-03"/>
                        <p>-- are willing to put their professional reputations on the line in support of their findings. They are fully backed by the Atlanta Communicable Diseases Center.</p>
                        <p>Thus, we are in the position of knowing that the collapse of Biafra would bring a disaster of the first magnitude unless a massive effort were undertaken immediately. Without impressing this upon the Federals and urging their immediate action in strong terms, we open the President to the charge of complacency in the face of mass deaths, after we have committed ourselves publicly to rendering all assistance possible.</p>
                        <p>The Western Report is already known in relief circles and may well have been leaked on the Hill. It is only a matter of time until the storm breaks. Blame will fall unjustly but inevitably on the President rather than on those responsible in the bureaucracy.</p>
                        <p>Nigeria is certainly important in the future of Africa. But it is equally clear that beyond the euphoria of victory, the country will be prey to the same powerful forces of instability and division that have plagued it for 50 years. Gowon remains the figurehead of an expedient compromise between elements whose clashing ambitions will be rekindled with the end of the war. His own future is murky at best.</p>
                        <p>Even at that, however, I am not suggesting a break with Nigeria. What we have to do is tell them the unpalatable facts and stand clear if they refuse to act. This may wound their pride, but it will scarcely be the end of the U.S. position in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>The alternative may well be to avoid ruffling feathers at the price of large-scale human loss in the enclave and serious political damage here.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. FOLLOWING ARE DEWEYʼS OVERALL OBSERVATIONS OF JUST COMPLETED VISIT TO ENCLAVE:</p>
                        <p>2. DISASTER Of MAJOR PROPORTIONS APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING HERE. REPORTS EMANATING TO DATE FROM ENCLAVE AREA HAVE GENERALLY SERIOUSLY MISREPRESENTED DIMENSIONS OF PROBLEM. DOCTORS AND RELIEF WORKERS I TALKED TO WERE SURPRISED TO HEAR OF THESE REPORTS AND SAID THAT WAS NOT THE WAY THEY WERE FILED. AT LEAST ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN ACUTE NEED NOW AND SITUATION GROWS WORSE DAILY. PRESENT RELIEF DELIVERY CAPACITIES NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO COPE. RELIEF EFFORT IS ESSENTIALLY PARALYZED DUE BEHAVIOUR Of 3RD DIVISION IN OCCUPIED AREAS. THESE ACTIONS, LOOTING, RAPING, COMANDEERING ARE COMMON TO WAR BUT CONSEQUENCES HERE ARE BLOCKAGE OF RELIEF EFFORT. AFTER BRILLIANT TACTICAL EFFORTS, OBASANJO HAS NOW LOST CONTROL OF HIS TROOPS. THERE IS STILL, HOWEVER, NO EVIDENCE OR CHARGES OF KILLING OF CIVILIANS OR OTHER ATROCITIES.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d175-02" facs="d175-02"/>
                        <p>3. PROBLEM PARTICULARLY EXPLOSIVE BECAUSE PRESS HAVE SEEN JUST ENOUGH DURING RECENT ESCORTED VISIT TO REALIZE HOW INADEQUATE RELIEF EEFFORT IS. FACT THAT OBASANJO NOW NOT PERMITTING THEM TO LEAVE PORT HARCOURT MEANS, AT LEAST, THEY WILL EVENTUALLY VENT THEIR UGLY MOOD AGAINST <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN LED BY SUCH REPORTS AS HAVE EMANATED FROM ENCLAVE TO BELIEVE SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL WAS BEING DONE ABOUT RELIEF.</p>
                        <p>4. NEED CENTERS AROUND OWERRI WHERE FOUR-MAN AUSTRIAN TEAM AND ONE LORRY TRYING TO COPE WITH ABOUT I MILLION PEOPLE. SINCE MARKET FOOD COSTLY AND LIMITED, ONE LED TO CONCLUSION THAT MOST NEED FULL FEEDING NOW. ALL WILL NEED IT WITHIN A WEEK. ORLU AREA IS NEXT PRIORITY. EXACT NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE FROM ORLU CENTER NOT KNOWN, BUT DR. HOBBS (NRC AREA MEDICAL ADVISOR, ENUGU) ESTIMATES APPROXIMATELY SAME NUMBER LORRIES REQUIRED THERE AS FOR OWERRI. OHAFIA AREA NOT VISITED AND STILL PRETTY MUCH A BLANK. MEMBERS OF SCF TEAM 6 RECENTLY ARRIVED AT ORLU FROM AFIKPO DESCRIBED CONDITIONS AS VERY GRAVE, INCLUDING MANY WOUNDED SOLDIERS. APPROXIMATE DISTRIBUTION NEEDS RIGHT NOW ARE 200 TONS. AVERAGE DAILY DISTRIBUTION THIS WEEK HAS BEEN 40-50 TONS.</p>
                        <p>5. SUFFICIENCY OF LORRIES AT THIS POINT IS ALMOST ACADEMIC. BEHAVIOR OF 3RD DIVISION TROOPS PLACES RED CROSS RELIEF LORRIES IN CONSTANT JEOPARDY AND ELIMINATES, FOR THE MOMENT, USE OF CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES HIDDEN IN ENCLAVE BUSH. COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ARE INSISTING ON ASSURANCES AGAINST LOSING THEIR VEHICLES, WHICH WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO INCLUDE A MILITARY POLICE ESCORT.</p>
                        <p>6. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH THE 3RD DIVISION INCLUDE:</p>
                        <p>A. OBASANJOʼS “RETURN TO BARRACKS” ORDER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN IGNORED. UNSUPERVISED BANDS OF STRAGGLERS AND MARAUDERS ARE EVERYWHERE.</p>
                        <p>B. STRAGGLERS SET UP THEIR OWN INFORMAL CHECK POINTS ALONG ROADS, PRINCIPALLY TO GET RIDES. THEIR MANNER IS TYPICALLY ARGUMENTATIVE AND THREATENING, FAR MORE UNDISCIPLINED CHECKPOINT BEHAVIOR THAN I HAVE SEEN <pb n="3" xml:id="d175-03" facs="d175-03"/>BEFORE ON EITHER SIDE. (MY ONLY CONTACT WITH 1ST DIVISION WAS AT SEVERAL OF ITS CHECKPOINTS BETWEEN ORLU AND ULI THIS A.M. 1ST DIV. SOLDIERS WERE VERY CORRECT AND COURTEOUS AND TRIED TO GET RIDES FOR NEEDY CIVILIANS RATHER THEN THEMSELVES.)</p>
                        <p>C. SOLDIERS ARE COMMANDEERING RED CROSS LORRIES TO HAUL BOTH MILITARY CARGO AND LOOT. ANY COMMERCIAL OR PRIVATE VEHICLE ON ROAD ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE CONFISCATED. EVERYONE DOING HIS BEST TO HIDE TRANSPORT IN BUSH. AUSTRIAN TEAM TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TODAY TO GET MILITARY LORRIES BADLY NEEDED FOR RELIEF DISTRIBUTION FROM 14 BRIGADE CO AND OWERRI. CO DID PROVIDE TWO DRUMS PETROL.</p>
                        <p>D. WIDESPREAD MOLESTING OF YOUNG WOMEN, PARTICULARLY NURSES. THIS IS PARALYZING HOSPITAL WORK AND WILL HINDER OPENING OF SICK BAYS EVEN WHEN FOOD IS AVAILABLE TO SERVICE THEM. RELIEF TEAMS TRYING TO FIND MALE NURSES AND OLD WOMEN TO SUPPLEMENT. FEW YOUNG NURSES WHO DO WORK ARRIVE LATE, LEAVE EARLY TO MINIMIZE RISK OF BEING MOLESTED.</p>
                        <p>E. SOLDIERS WERE OBSERVED AT EMEKUKU TEACHING HOSPITAL LOOTING ITEMS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO RESTORE SUCH FACILITIES TO NORMALCY. BROUGHT TO ATTENTION OF LT. IN CHARGE, WITHOUT RESULTS. LORRY LOADS OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVING ALONG ROADS. MUCH INDISCRIMINATE DAMAGE NOTED IN AREAS LOOTED. (NOT ALL LOOTING DONE BYMILITARY, HOWEVER, MUCH ALSO DONE BY CIVILIANS IN AREA.)<lb/>GP-2</p>

                            <lb/>8:03 pm 1/22/70</p>
                        <p>K: We have to get the Nigerians to let the stuff in there. Most of the measure We put 8 C-130ʼs and helicopters on alert and $1 million for relief agencies. They asked last week for jeeps, trucks and hospitals. The jeeps are there. The trucks are being flown in at $17 thousand a truck. The hospitals ? ? ? ? ?. They have been asking for more. You were briefed on the Western report. Today they asked for planes and we are sending four Red Cross and 2 ? ?, 10, 000 blankets and lamps, 3 thousand 7 ?, 6,000 tons of food, 40, 000 tons of food for the next 30 days and then the same again. The problem is to get it into the enclave itself. Now only on the edges. This is, just as a friend, we suffer no agony if a little hint, particularly over Nigeria. We Are doing all we can. We can make a number of grandstand plays that will not get the food in.</p>
                        <p>T: You take ? ? ? ? ? <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> were very frank. I have never heard in the last 7 or 8 nears a report as frank. We have had good sources and telegrams that came through the Department about the 3rd division and Red Cross efforts. I was very impressed and complimented the Administration on that. The problem from that <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> report is -- 30-60 percent are dying. The best estimate for today. That is pretty emotional. But in terms of their report and considering 10 million people dying. You have 100 tons of food in short. Your reports say</p>
                        <p>K: We made ten thousand tons of wheat</p>
                        <p>T: Thatʼs their figure and how much to distribution places? Eleven days have gone by and the situation is deteriorating in terms of security. Efforts by the NRC are at a standstill. One division is out of control. Your reports this morning say it is falling apart. The other report that the relief personnel previously were effective but now they are closed down.</p>
                        <p>K: What should we do?</p>
                        <p>T: I think it is important to get international observers in there. I would get &amp; more than 17.</p>
                        <p>K: You saw what <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U THANT</persName> said this week</p>
                        <p>T: That Chief Justice Dohemi is an effective contact I donʼt know how valid that is and he could work with the Government. Your people would probably know. The relief people think and saw isolated people being fingered over there. I am sure there isnʼt mass genocide. But if we can get more in there. It is terribly important. In terms of this ? ? ? ? keep relief personnel in there to distribute. If we could keep people and personnel in there. Where the hell is Ojukwu? You probably know. What about effort -- if he did said he wouldnʼt so in again if he could go in for a few days to get things sorted out?</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d176-02" facs="d176-02"/>
                        <p>T: (cont.) We have to build hate (?) and if the Administration says nothing is getting done. These people resent our talking about their problem</p>
                        <p>K: The agony of this thing is so great we have been building all kinds of fires. The bureaucracy says this is a diplomatic problem. Let me see what I can do. This is not turn you off. Its not a political issue</p>
                        <p>T: I just think the situation will be that in 10 days when the next people go in there they will find an incredible situation. I think it is damn frustrating. One of the disappointing things is that before this the others said there was no genocide but they were at Owerri which was captured 12 months ago.</p>
                        <p>K: All I can tell you Ted is above all to make clear that as long as I have been here I have not agonized over a problem like this. And the obstacles put in the way by the bureaucracy on the one side and the African sensitivities on the other. The President is very concerned. He wanted me to let you know.</p>
                        <p>T: <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> made a point but Goodell started going on it.</p>
                        <p>K: Our next point is to do some of what you mentioned and get food into the area</p>
                        <p>T: The Biafrans wouldnʼt accept church aid but you can free up the food. Ferguson said they are working on that. You have the plans there.</p>
                        <p>K: That has significance to Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>T: They are letting plans into Nigeria but no further. They said they could handle it but</p>
                        <p>K: Letʼs stay in touch</p>
                        <p>T: Yes</p>
                        <p>K: This is one in which we are both working for the same thing and the President wanted you to know what we are doing and that we are trying to do more. In this buildng we are trying to build fires. If you have any ideas that you feel are not being looked at, let me know.</p>
                        <p>T: You have a limited team (?) for access but may be thereʼs something there.</p>
                        <p>K: Letʼs talk again early next week.</p>

                        <p>The following are U. S. actions taken so far in Nigerian relief.</p>
                        <p>-- Eight C-130s and 4 helicopters are on alert.</p>
                        <p>-- $10 million has been pledged to relief agencies, of which $2 million has gone indirectly to the Nigerian Red Cross, and the remainder yet to be dispensed.</p>
                        <p>-- $2 million has been promised to UNICEF, conditional on the role UNICEF can work out with the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>-- The Nigerians asked us last weekend for 50 jeeps, 50 trucks and 3 pre-packaged hospitals. The jeeps and hospitals are on the way -- arriving between now and January 28 by commercial charter flight (as the Nigerians requested). The trucks will be flown out in a few days.</p>
                        <p>-- The Nigerians today asked us to coordinate and finance the chartering of 4 Red Cross cargo planes and 2 commercial charter planes from Europe for an airlift within Nigeria. This is being arranged and the chartered planes should be available over the next 3-4 days.</p>
                        <p>-- They also asked today for urgent airlift from the U.S. of 10, 000 blankets, 10, 000 lamps and 50 generators. Plans are to fly these to Nigeria in the next 2-3 days, probably by military aircraft.</p>
                        <p>-- Charter ships are moving 6, 000 tons of food from nearby Dahomey and Sao Tome. Plans now call for food stockpiles of 40, 000 tons for the next 30 days. Added purchases and shipment are being planned to make available another 40, 000 tons for the following 30 days.</p>
                        <p>-- In sum, as of tomorrow our contributions will actually begin to arrive in Nigeria.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d178-02" facs="d178-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>-- The “Western Report, “ named for the leader of a scientific survey done in Biafra by U.S. Public Health Doctors last fall, documented widespread starvation edema. The Report concluded that 1 to 1-1/2,million would need daily feeding with high protein food to survive.</p>
                        <p>-- Before the collapse of Biafra and the interruption of the relief airlift, 2, 000 tons of food was going in weekly and the population was still deteriorating rapidly. The Western Report concluded that, considering all factors, 10, 000 tons a week would be needed to prevent mass deaths from starvation in the event of the collapse of Biafra.</p>
                        <p>-- Dr. Western and his survey team also concluded that the Nigerian Red Cross, even with the best motivation, would not be able alone to forestall mass deaths.</p>
                        <p>-- A U.S. survey team just back from affected areas confirms both the need and Nigerian inability which Dr. Western et. al. predicted. For example, only 300 tons at most got into the needy area last week and Nigerian relief operations are in disarray.</p>
                        <p>-- The survey team also reports acts of looting and other indiscipline by Federal troops, which further obstruct relief.</p>
                        <p>-- Yesterday [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] indicated Nigerian awareness in the field of a serious situation. Reports today from Lagos, however, indicate there is still no clear recognition of the magnitude or urgency of the problem. Though they have asked for aircraft from an internal airlift, they still do not plan to fly food directly into the needy area.</p>
                        <p>-- In sum, the Nigerians are prepared to allow an airlift to the fringes of the needy area, but this will not attack the real problem -- the inability to distribute food rapidly inside the former enclave of Biafra.</p>
                        <p>-- Without an airlift directly into the needy area, and without an urgent reorganization of Nigerian relief operations, the evidence is strong that many if not all of 1 to 1-1/2 million people will die in the next 15-20 days.</p>
                        <p>-- The changes necessary to allow distribution of the necessary weekly tonnage (10, 000) to save the 1 to 1-1/2 million depend upon Nigerian recognition of (a) the seriousness of the problem and (b) their inability to cope within their present plans.</p>

                        <p>-- Senators <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> and Goodell have held hearings yesterday and today. They have pressed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> on the Western Report as well as on current eyewitness accounts, including the official U.S. survey team and the press.</p>
                        <p>-- Senator Goodell has requested the publication of the Western Report and that the Congress be fully informed of current accounts from the field.</p>
                        <p>-- Press and TV accounts have been largely very critical of Nigerian relief operations and point to mass suffering and death.</p>
                        <p>-- This press reaction may grow when the large number of reporters (about 80), recently in the needy area, return over the next 2-3 days.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> initiated the conversation. He began with a discussion of the Nigerian problem making an all-out defense of the Lagos Government. He said that the Nigerians donʼt want to be pushed around. The Russians have taken an anti-tribal line, and have therefore scored many points in Nigeria. Military discipline is being restored so that there was no danger of unusual massacres in the eastern province. The Western report indicated that most of the starvation in the enclave antedated the occupation by the Nigerians. It proves that starvation was even then endemic. Of course, he concluded, the press takes dirty and slushy pictures, but if one takes a panoramic view, one recognizes that things are as well as they could be, and that many of the reports of starvation are self-serving.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether more supplies could be sent in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that most of the difficulty was not in getting food into Nigeria, but in getting it from the entrance port to the Eastern Region. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> said that the important thing was to get tents for the Federal troops in the Eastern Region so they would not have to live off the population. The President said it was essential that we keep our humanitarian concern front and center in order not to be vulnerable to public opinion. The Prime Minister replied, “Letʼs make sure that we donʼt push Lagos into the arms of the Soviets; we have to keep close together. Another week or ten days is likely to get us out of the woods.”</p>
                        <p>The President repeated that we should defuse the issue by making clear that our concern is primarily humanitarian. We and the British have to work together for common humanitarian concerns. We have to try to make clear that we are on top of the situation and that we are doing what we can.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> then challenged the figure that 2, 000 tons a week had gone into Biafra in the last weeks. He said that only 1, 000 tons went in and that a maximum of 6, 000 tons were needed now. We agreed that we would try to achieve a joint estimate of the situation.</p>

                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d179-03" facs="d179-03"/>
                        <p>The President began the conversation with a rather strong statement on Nigeria. He said he is not concerned with who caused the suffering; I donʼt want to hear “who killed John?” We donʼt blame the Federals. The fact is that the suffering exists. Quakers and Jewish people in particular are concerned, and the President himself has a Quaker background. Because people are concerned, everyone should help now. We should all try to get <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs cooperation to respond to Nigerian need. We should at least agree on a common factual basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> said we should remember Gone with the Windʼs 700 pages on the situation after the Civil War and that there was always a lot of suffering in such cases. The President said yes, and we donʼt want a nationalist-socialist combination in Nigeria, but still we have to do what we can.</p>

                        <p>1. AT THE 28 JANUARY 1970 MEETING OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (FEC) OF THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA (<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>), GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">YAKUBU GOWON</persName>, THE HEAD OF THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, SPOKE WITH SOME HEAT ABOUT THE EFFORTS THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LAGOS WAS MAKING IN ATTEMPTING TO PRESS ITS ESTIMATES OF RELIEF NEEDS IN THE EAST-CENTRAL STATES ON THE FMG. IT HAD COME TO HIS ATTENTION, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> SAID, THAT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY HAD MADE SEVERAL APPROACHES TO HIS GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR WAS REQUESTING AN URGENT INTERVIEW WITH HIM TO DISCUSS CONDITIONS IN THE EASTERN REGION. GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> MADE CLEAR TO THE MEMBERS OF THE FEC THAT HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT THESE CONTINUED DEMANDS OF THE AMERICANS, WHICH HE CONSIDERED INTERFERENCE IN HIS GOVERNMENTʼS AFFAIRS. GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> STATED, “THE AMERICANS WISH TO INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT I DO NOT DEMAND TO INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS IN ALABAMA OR IN VIETNAM.” HE INDICATED TO THE FEC THAT IN HIS SPEECH TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS IN NIGERIA ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE WAS GOING TO MENTION THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT TOLERATE INTERFERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF NIGERIA. HE SAID THAT HE SPECIFICALLY MEANT THE AMERICANS, AS HE DEEPLY RESENTED THEIR CURRENT TACTICS.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d180-02" facs="d180-02"/>
                        <p>2. GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> ALSO INDICATED THAT WHAT DISTURBED HIM MOST WAS THAT HE THOUGHT RELATIONS WITH THE AMERICANS WERE CURRENTLY GOING SO WELL. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] WHICH DESCRIBES THE FEC MEETING OF 21 JANUARY 1970 DURING (WHICH GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> PUT AN END TO A DISCUSSION CRITICIZING AMERICAN RELIEF EFFORTS BY STATING THAT HE FELT THAT AMERICAN-NIGERIAN RELATIONS WERE GOING ALONG QUITE WELL.) IN FACT, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> SAID, IT WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE AMERICANS SHOULD PUSH SO HARD ON THE RELIEF ISSUE WHEN MOST US-NIGERIAN BILATERAL PROBLEMS APPEARED TO BE OVER. IN ENDING THIS MONOLOGUE GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> SAID THAT PERHAPS THIS CONTINUED AMERICAN PREOCCUPATION WITH CONDITIONS IN THE EAST CENTRAL STATE WAS COVERING UP SOME FACTOR ABOUT WHICH THE NIGERIANS WERE NOT AWARE. FOR EXAMPLE, PERHAPS THE AMERICANS WERE MUCH MORE INVOLVED WITH THE SECESSIONISTS THAN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNDERSTOOD AND THIS CURRENT CAMPAIGN WAS IN SOME WAY RELATED TO “AN EARLIER AMERICAN EFFORT TO SUSTAIN BIAFRA.”</p>
                        <p>3. (SOURCE COMMENT: PRO-AMERICAN LEADERS OF THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT PRESSURE BEING PUT ON THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> BY THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LAGOS ON THE ISSUE OF RELIEF. WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DELIVERY OF FOOD TO THE EX-REBEL AREA, CONDITIONS THERE ARE BASICALLY QUITE GOOD. NIGERIAN OFFICIALS DO NOT ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT THERE IS ACTUAL OR IMPENDING STARVATION AND FEEL WITH THE ADDITION OF MORE TRANSPORT AND MORE TIME, THE BASIC FEEDING PROBLEMS OF THE EAST-CENTRAL STATE WILL BE SOLVED. THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> IS QUITE PROUD OF ITS EFFORTS TOWARD RECONCILIATION AND THE SUCCESS OF ITS OWN RELIEF EFFORTS TO DATE. IN NIGERIAN MINDS, CONDITIONS ARE INCREASINGLY SATISFACTORY IN THE EX-REBEL AREA AND CONTINUED AMERICAN INSISTENCE THAT SERIOUS PROBLEMS EXIST IS CAUSING DEEP RESENTMENT TOWARD THE UNITED STATES.)</p>

                        <p>1. THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS FIRST OF THREE EYEWITNESS REPORTS (FARRELLʼS) MENTIONED <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">REFTEL</gloss>. OTHERS FOLLOW. EMBASSY COMMENTING IN SEPARATE MESSAGE ON ALL THREE REPORTS.</p>
                        <p>2. ROUTE TRAVELLED: ENUGU, ULI, ONITSHA, NNEWI, OZUBULU, IHIALA, ILI, ORLU (INIOMA), ISLEKE, USULA-ILHASIAFOR, ORLU, OWERRI, EMEKUKU, OWERRI, ABA, PORT HARCOURT.</p>
                        <p>3. DURING THE TRIP OUTLINED ABOVE, THE REPORTING OFFICER SEPARATED FROM ANOTHER EMBASSY OFFICER AND A USAID OFFICIAL, AND TRAVELLED ALONE THROUGH THE ROUTE OUTLINED ABOVE, BY HITCH-HIKING WITH RELIEF TRUCKS, RED CROSS VEHICLES, POLICE VANS AND LOCAL “BIAFRAN” VEHICLES.</p>
                        <p>4. IN GENERAL, I WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED THAT THE PORTION OF THE ENCLAVE VISITED WAS IN SUCH GOOD SHAPE, SINCE I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE MUCH MORE DEVASTATION THROUGHOUT THE <pb n="2" xml:id="d181-02" facs="d181-02"/>SECTOR WHICH WAS THE LAST AREA TO FALL TO FEDERAL FORCES. KEY POINTS THAT WERE NOTED BY PERSONAL OBSERVATION AND TN CONVERSATIONS WITH AT LEAST 75 PEOPLE WHO INCLUDED IBOS FROM VARIOUS WALKS OF LIFE, FEDERAL TROOPS AND OFFICERS, AND NIGERIAN POLICE OFFICERS OF ALL RANKS, AS WELL AS EXPATRIATE RELIEF WORKERS WERE:</p>
                        <p>A. THERE IS NO STATE OF VIOLENCE, GREAT TENSION, OR FEAR IN THE AREA. THE IBO CIVILIANS AND EX-MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE MIXING FREELY AND PEACEFULLY WITH THE TROOPS AND FEDERAL POLICE IN THE ENCLAVE.</p>
                        <p>B. THE POLICE HAVE TAKEN OVER THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER. ONLY A FEW TROOPS WERE SEEN ARMED IN THE ENCLAVE, AND MOST TROOPS SEEN WERE STROLLING ALONG THE ROADS OR IN LOOSELY GROUPED STAGING AREAS. ROAD BLOCKS AND CHECKPOINTS, WHICH WERE ENCOUNTERED FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT THE AREA, WERE MANNED MAINLY BY BOTH ARMED POLICE AND TROOPS.</p>
                        <p>C. THE RELIEF TEAMS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO BECOME FULLY ORGANIZED AND FOOD SUPPLIES ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE MORE CRITICAL AREAS IN QUANTITIES SUFFICIENT TO PRECLUDE MASS STARVATION. ROAD TRANSPORT APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FACING THE RELIEF TEAMS AND DURING THE TRIP THE AVAILABILITY OF VEHICLES VARIED GREATLY FROM ONE RELIEF CENTER TO ANOTHER. THE NUMBER OF EX-BIAFRAN TRUCKS BEING USED IN RELIEF WORK WAS SURPRISING AND LOCAL IBOS ARE BEING EMPLOYED BY THE NRC IN LOADING AND DISTRIBUTING FOOD FROM THE NRC CENTERS. THESE IBOS ARE PRESENTLY BEING PAID IN FOOD.</p>
                        <p>D. THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED FOR MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORT, I.E. TRUCKS TO MOVE THE REFUGEES BACK TO THEIR HOME TOWNS. THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES WERE OBSERVED WALKING ALONG THE ROADS, WHILE MANY WERE BEING TRANSPORTED ON RELIEF TRUCKS RETURNING TO THEIR FOOD WAREHOUSING AREAS. THE POPULATION MOVING ALONG THE ROADS APPEARED TO BE IN FAIRLY GOOD CONDITION AND WERE GENERALLY CARRYING THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSIONS. NRC REFUGEE FEEDING POINTS WERE SET UP IN MOST OF THE MAJOR TOWNS AND VILLAGES VISITED.</p>
                        <p>E. THE IBO POPULATION DOES NOT FEAR EXTERMINATION, AND <pb n="3" xml:id="d181-03" facs="d181-03"/>ALL THE IBOS INTERVIEWED ALONG THE WAY STATED THAT ALMOST EVERYONE HAS COME OUT OF THE “<persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">BUSH</persName>”. THE TROOPS OF THE 1ST DIVISION WERE OBSERVED SHARING THEIR RATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE IN THEIR AREA AND THEY WERE WELL DISCIPLINED.</p>
                        <p>F. THERE WERE, IN THE FIRST SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE BIAFRAN FORCES, MANY CASES OF RAPE AND LOOTING CARRIED OUT BY THE TROOPS OF THE 3RD MARINE COMMANDO DIVISION IN THE AREA AS FAR NORTH AS IHIALA. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES (IBOS INCLUDED), LOOTING BY THE TROOPS WAS FOLLOWED UP BY LOOTING BY THE IBOS THEMSELVES. AT THIS POINT, THE 1ST DIVISION TROOPS HAVE BEEN MOVED FARTHER SOUTH TO BELOW ORLU AND THE 3RD MARINE COMMANDO DIVISION HAS BEEN MOVED BACK TO OWERRI. ONE GETS THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT THE 3RD MARINE COMMANDO DIVISION IS A LESS DISCIPLINED UNIT THAN THE 1ST DIVISION. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA UNDER THEIR CONTROL, ALTHOUGH CORRECT, IS NOT AS CLOSE AS THAT OF THE 1ST DIVISION TROOPS.</p>
                        <p>G. THE IBOS WHO WERE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE REGISTERING IN WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO “NORMAL” AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE FOR THE EAST CENTRAL STATE ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT 4,000 IBO POLICE HAVE REPORTED BACK FOR DUTY. MANY OF THESE IBO POLICE WERE OBSERVED WORKING WITH THE 12 FEDERAL POLICE UNITS WHICH WERE MOVED INTO THE ENCLAVE AFTER THE SUDDEN COLLAPSE OF THE BIAFRAN FORCES. VARIOUS ESTIMATES WERE GIVEN BY DIFFERENT SOURCES ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE “ENCLAVE” AND IN AVERAGING THE FIGURES, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT ABOUT ONE MILLION IBOS HAVE <pb n="4" xml:id="d181-04" facs="d181-04"/>MOVED OUT OF THE ENCLAVE, WHILE SOMEWHAT OVER TWO MILLION STILL REMAIN THERE.</p>
                        <p>H. THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE IN THE AREA TRAVELLED VARIED GREATLY FROM ONE MAJOR TOWN TO ANOTHER. HOWEVER, APART FROM ONITSHA MARKET WHICH WAS HIT VERY HARD, MOST OF THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURES IN THE LARGER TOWNS AVD VILLAGES WERE RELATIVELY UNTOUCHED, EXCEPT FOR BROKEN WINDOWS AND BULLET SCARS. IF ONE COULD VENTURE A GENERAL AVERAGE, COMPLETE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION IN THE AREA WAS ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT. THE ROADS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE AND THE SECTIONS WHICH WERE DUG OUT OR BLOWN UP, MAINLY EAST AND SOUTH OF ONITSHA, HAVE BEEN FILLED IN AND ARE PASSABLE. THERE WAS NO STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO “ BIAFRAN” HOSPITALS SEEN AT OZUBULU, IHIALA AND EIIEKUKLL. ALTHOUGH THESE HOSPITALS NEED ADDITIONAL BEDS, MEDICINES AND EQUIPMENT. ALMOST ALL THE BRIDGES IN THE AREA WERE DESTROYED AND HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY TEMPORARY BRIDGES CONSTRUCTED BY THE ARMY <pb n="5" xml:id="d181-05" facs="d181-05"/>ENGINEERS, AND THESE BRIDGES WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE FULLY LOADED RED CROSS TRUCKS. ULI AIRSTRIP WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE APART FROM A FEW SHELL HOLES OR BOMB CRATERS WHICH COULD BE EASILY REPAIRED. THE SURFACE OF THIS AIRSTRIP WAS ACTUALLY IN BETTER SHAPE THAN THE STRIPS IN ENUGU AND PORT HARCOURT. THERE WAS A SURPRISING NUMBER OF BIAFRA- REGISTERED VEHICLES IN OPERATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA CLOSE TO ENUGU. THE CONDITION OF THESE VEHICLES WAS GENERALLY GOOD, IN FACT MOST LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN THE AVERAGE NIGERIAN-OWNED VEHICLES IN LAGOS(#) CHILDREN WERE PART OF A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 500 THAT WERE BROUGHT IN AFTER THE ENCLAVE WAS OVERRUN. THESE WERE THE MOST EXTREME CASES OF MALNUTRITION OBSERVED, AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY HAD BEEN ON A STARVATION DIET FOR SOME MONTHS. CONTRARY TO PRESS REPORTS, THESE CHILDREN WERE CARED FOR IMMEDIATELY UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AT PORT HARCOURT AND THEY ARE GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE CHILDREN WERE TRAPPED IN A SMALL POCKET AND WERE UNABLE TO GET FOOD AND MEDICAL AID UNTIL THE AREA THEY WERE IN WAS OPENED UP. DR sPIFF, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CLINIC, HAS AN ADEQUATE STAFF TO HANDLE THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION WHICH IS IMPROVING EACH DAY. HOWEVER, A HIGH PROPORTION OF THESE CHILDREN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE AFFECTED FOR LIFE. THIS WAS THE ONE STRIKINGLY TRAGIC REALITY OBSERVED OF A TRAGIC WAR.</p>

                        <p>3. On Nigeria, Roger said the federal government may be destroying the Uli airfield.

                            <lb/>FOR SECRETARY FROM <persName corresp="#p_REL1">RICHARDSON</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I understand that General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> may raise with you what he considers unfair Western criticism and unwarranted interference in Nigerian relief. In the event <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> should do so contrary to your desire to avoid the relief question, I thought it might be useful for me to report to you on how the problem looks from here.</p>
                        <p>2. In both political and human terms, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs sense of personal grievance over recent developments is quite understandable. Having launched a magnanimous policy of national reconciliation, the wave of critical press reports on conditions in Eastern Nigeria (which seemed to receive confirmation by official pressure on the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to accept more relief) must have come, as Ambassador TRUEHEART reports, as a rude shock. And in considering our motives and those of <pb n="2" xml:id="d183-02" facs="d183-02"/>others, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his colleagues must surely have recalled with mixed feelings our de facto neutrality and substantial support of international relief operations within the secessionist area during the civil war.</p>
                        <p>3. If <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> chooses to raise this matter, I believe that we can and should affirm our admiration for the vigor and seriousness with which the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has begun to tackle the relief problem, emphasizing that our own sole purpose has been to be of assistance in a situation essentially caused by the secessionist leadershipʼs determination to prolong a futile war. On the other hand, in light of the advice provided by our experts, I do not believe that we are as yet in a position to leave the impression, privately or publicly, of being fully reassured on conditions in the former rebel territory.</p>
                        <p>4. In this connection, I have just met with Dr. Jean Mayer and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> to review the results of the new nutritional survey conducted for the Nigerian Red Cross. While there <pb n="3" xml:id="d183-03" facs="d183-03"/>are differences in emphasis between the experts, there was agreement that the new survey largely corroborates earlier findings of a very serious situation in the area of the former Biafran enclave (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 23814). Similarly, as regards food, while shipments have been increasing, they remain far short of the targets set by the Nigerians themselves (4,500 tons a week or 20,000 tons a month). Our logistics experts here, familiar with the local situation, still question just how quickly we can hope the Nigerians will achieve their own targets -- although there is no doubt that the situation is progressively getting better.</p>
                        <p>5. I fully agree with Ambassador TRUEHEARTʼs assessment that given the Nigeriansʼ extreme defensiveness and sensitivity the only way of dealing with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> on this problem is in an entirely non-political manner, through technical channels, especially those between the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Mission and the various Nigerian ministries and organization concerned with relief <pb n="4" xml:id="d183-04" facs="d183-04"/>and rehabilitation. Furthermore, without touching on this problem, your visit will be indirectly of considerable benefit to the U.S. Nigerian dialogue on relief by establishing a more cordial tone in U.S. Nigerian relations - following a period when even diplomatic amenities were held to a bare minimum.</p>
                        <p>6. Within the very real limitations note&amp; above, I believe that in view of the seriousness of the situation in Eastern Nigeria our mission should continue, in a low key manner, to make available all possible assistance to the Nigerians in their efforts to achieve a more adequate relief program.</p>
                        <p>7. As regards the public treatment of the relief situation, your intention to avoid, if possible, public comment on this problem also seems to me the best course under the circumstances. Press coverage on Nigerian relief here has been declining -- although editorial interest can still be sparked quickly as by a recent UPI item on US relief supplies accumulating <pb n="5" xml:id="d183-05" facs="d183-05"/>in Lagos. Furthermore, strongly favorable official comment on the progress of the Nigerian program, implying that the problem has now been brought fully under control, would quite possibly still invite substantial adverse comment Lord from chose concerned over the adequacy of the Nigerian effort.</p>
                        <p>8. You know that Marvin Kalb travelling with you has been the American newsman perhaps most concerned with the moral dilemmas of this situation. He will be extremely sensitive to the tone and posture of our mission in Lagos.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I visited Nigeria from January 26 to February 5, 1970, together with Mr. Claus Ruser and Mr. William Mithoefer of the Department of State. From January 26 to February 1, we remained in Lagos interviewing personnel at the Embassy, USAID, and non-U. S. organizations. Discussions were held with Ambassador TRUEHEART, USAID Director Adler, Ambassador Labouisse (UNICEF), and British High Commissioner Sir Leslie Glass, among others. From February 1 to February 5 we toured the southern area of the former Biafran enclave, meeting with Colonel Obasanjo (the General Officer commanding Nigeriaʼs Third Marine Commando Division) and relief personnel operating throughout the area.</p>
                        <p>We also visited hospitals, relief feeding stations and distribution points, off-loading and warehouse facilities in Port Harcourt and Red Cross Operating Centers. During the period we visited nine villages in the interior assisting Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">George Lythcott</persName>, a U.S. physician, who was participating in a medical-nutritional survey under the sponsorship of the Nigerian Ministry of Health and the Nigerian Red Cross.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is widespread malnutrition in the area of the former Biafran enclave. The situation differs markedly, however, from village to village. The Owerri-Orlu area, which was the last to fall to the Nigerian forces, evidenced the greatest need both as to numbers and severity. It was clear that extraordinary efforts would be required quickly if the already bad situation in this area were not to deteriorate further.</p>
                        <p>The flow of refugees, though continuing, seemed to be tapering off. Those who had recently left refugee camps in federally-held areas where they had been receiving regular feeding through the fCRC were in noticeably better condition than those who had been longer away from the refugee camps.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d184-02" facs="d184-02"/>
                        <p>The medical-nutritional survey covering some 50 villages and about 4, 000 randomly selected individuals is nearing completion. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> will return this week with preliminary data on its findings.</p>
                        <p>The security situation is markedly improved. Policy have taken on the major role in law enforcement, traffic control, etc. The troops for the most part are in cantonment areas. Scattered incidents still occur but a major effort has been made by Nigerian military authorities to control troops in the area and to prevent such incidents or undisciplined behaviour. Fear of the federal forces, which characterized the early days following the collapse, is diminishing. Ibo personnel, formerly employed in hospitals and clinics, are beginning to return to work -- the numbers are small thus far but all evidence indicates they will increase rapidly in the coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>Continued presence of large numbers of troops in the area will pose growing problems. Troops are occupying schools and other facilities for lack of other suitable billeting in most areas. This impedes return to normalcy and complicates the relief feeding problem. If the schools could be opened soon, much feeding could be accomplished through them with greater ease and effectiveness than is now possible. The troops have little to do and efforts to keep them busy will pose growing burdens on commanders. Moreover, they are consuming some local food which otherwise would be available for the population in need. The Nigerian military is aware of the problem but is not yet sure how to deal with it -- where the troops should be stationed and how soon demobilization can begin are questions to which answers have not yet been developed.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will not permit the use of the airfields within the former Biafran enclave for relief purposes. However illogical in terms of the capability which these fields afford to meet urgent relief needs, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> at the highest levels consider these fields to be symbols of Biafran resistance and will not employ them. There was growing evidence that the airfields would be rendered unusable by the federal forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Problems of Relief</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The immediate problems in the relief effort are distribution, organization, and momentum. There is clearly enough imported food in the area or on the way to meet the estimated needs. It is equally clear, however, that there is insufficient transport either to move the required quantities to main distribution points or to effect the distribution to remote areas where a large portion of those in need are located. <pb n="3" xml:id="d184-03" facs="d184-03"/>Local transport for hire will not be adequate to pick up the slack. A major effort is needed to put into use promptly the large number of vehicles being delivered by foreign donors. Delays in moving these vehicles to the relief area are seriously impeding relief efforts.</p>
                        <p>Main roads are in reasonably good condition and capable of handling the relief traffic for the present. Continued hard use will result in deterioration, however, given the lack of maintenance over the past year or two. This deterioration is likely to become a significant impediment to relief efforts with the onset of the rainy season in late spring this year unless maintenance efforts are significantly increased now. The many damaged bridges, which have been temporarily improved, need attention now if they are to continue serviceable under the growing traffic load.</p>
                        <p>There is some local food available but not in sufficient quantity to have a real impact in the next few months. The Red Cross is attempting to increase its purchase of food elsewhere in Nigeria but quantities available have been short of expectations. The slack will have to be made up by imported food. Some attention is being given to the need for a large scale planting program before the rainy season begins. Substantial imports of seed will be needed soon, however, if this program is to be effective.</p>
                        <p>The organization of the relief effort was all but chaotic. Expatriate personnel (in particular U.S. physicians from the NCDC Atlanta) with relief teams are making a monumental effort, but their efforts alone will be insufficient if the organizational arrangements are not improved quickly. Some steps are being taken to improve the coordination among the various relief agencies and the Nigerian Red Cross, but there is a crying need for a real organizational overhaul at every level from Lagos to the field teams. A complicating factor, which will grow in significance, is the relationship between the Nigerian Red Cross, the National Rehabilitation Commission and the rehabilitation commissions of the several states in eastern Nigeria. The State Rehab commissions are evidencing a growing tendency to assert their prerogatives but lack the organization, personnel, or the motivation of the Red Cross. Their bureaucratic concerns may impede rather than enhance the relief effort in the coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>There is evidence that the momentum of the relief effort is picking up after a very slow start in the early days after the collapse. The objective must be to sustain and increase this momentum. The afore-mentioned growing influence of the states, however, may work against <pb n="4" xml:id="d184-04" facs="d184-04"/>this effort. The feeding targets established by the Nigerian Red Cross and the Ministry of Economic Development are substantially below the estimated needs projected by the Western report. The higher estimates are now accepted as the basis for planning by Embassy Lagos and efforts are being made to gain acceptance of them by the Nigerian authorities.</p>
                        <p>If the targets are to be increased the impetus must come from Nigerian sources. The nutritional survey now in process will help to confirm real extent of the need and establish realistic feeding targets. Hopefully, the Ministry of Health and Red Cross will urge an increase in the feeding targets based on the findings of the survey. For the present, however, maximum effort must be devoted to increasing the amount of food being delivered to distribution points to meet at least the minimum targets already set.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Planning</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We could see no evidence of meaningful, detailed contingency planning. There is no doubt that the collapse came sooner than any, including the Nigerians, expected. Neither the Nigerians nor we were fully prepared for it. The Western report of nutritional needs which had been completed in November under <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>/CF auspices had not been brought to the attention of Federal Nigerian authorities in a meaningful way until mid January. Our Embassy had been given a summary of its conclusions but the significance of the conclusions for the post-hostilities period was not grasped. Many of the questions now arising had not been thought through in advance and answers to questions which seem obvious were not available ahead of time -- e. g. port and airfield capacities, licensing requirements, fuel storage availability, road and bridge condition, means for transshipment of supplies and equipment from Lagos to the East. All of these questions could have and should have been foreseen, but were not. The staffing and organization of our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> mission were inadequate to the magnitude of the task. The need for personnel actually stationed in and functioning in the east at major operations centers such as Port Harcourt and Enugu had been recognized. But only after several weeks are personnel actually being assigned there in numbers needed for effective operation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Embassy/USAID Approach</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Embassy seemed to be somewhat “business as usual.” The Embassyʼs principal concern centers on relations with <pb n="5" xml:id="d184-05" facs="d184-05"/>the Nigerian Government. These relations must be improved if an effective relief effort is to be mounted. But if fear that our relations might be disturbed is the overriding concern, the tendency will be to do nothing to press for improved relief efforts. It is important that the relief issue not be made a political issue. It is equally important. that the credit for improved relief go to the Nigerians -- our own profile in these respects should be as low as possible. There is a middle ground, however, in which the Embassy, using technical channels and discreet contacts, can bring the facts before the Nigerians meaningfully without involving political pressures.</p>
                        <p>Organizationally, the Ambassador was the focal point in the Embassy for relief matters. No one below the Ambassador himself was charged in the Embassy with the overall coordination of the effort. USAID Director Adler was the principal operator and carried the bulk of the load himself. His resources were thin. (On our arrival he expressed the view that his personnel resources were adequate for the task. Within a few days, however, he had developed a comprehensive list of additional operating personnel needed and was working on a complete reorganization to enhance the capability on the relief side.)</p>
                        <p>As noted, political pressures and public relations announcements of our role in relief are most likely to be counterproductive. In this we agree with the Embassy views. Given the basic inclination of the Embassy to avoid any step which might cause difficulties in our relations, however, it will be essential for some time that the Embassy be impressed with the urgent need to improve the relief effort. Otherwise any report of improving conditions will be seen by the Embassy as justification for relaxation of its own efforts.</p>

                        <p>LAGOS 1699<lb/>EYES ONLY FOR ACTING SECRETARY</p>
                        <p>1. YOUR 23092 JUST RECEIVED. AS I LEAVE FOR AIRPORT TO GO TO KINSHASA CONFERENCE IN AN HOUR, I CAN REPLY ONLY VERY BRIEFLY AT THIS TIME. ALSO, I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THE PARALLEL MESSAGE TO WHICH YOU REFER IN YOUR FIRST PARAGRAPH.</p>
                        <p>2. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL GENERAL POINTS WHICH I FEEL I MUST MAKE.</p>
                        <p>A. AS YOU APPRECIATE, OUR PRESSURES ON THE RELIEF FRONT HAVE BROUGHT OUR POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> CLOSE TO THE BREAKING POINT. IN MY JUDGMENT, THE TONE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP WILL NOT BE IMPROVED BY VIGOROUS ACTION BY THIS MISSION. JUST THE REVERSE IS TRUE: WE MUST MAINTAIN THE LOWEST OF PROFILES UNTIL THE IRRITATIONS RECENTLY CREATED HAVE SUBSIDED SOMEWHAT. IN PARTICULAR, THE KIND OF CONCERTED COUNTRY TEAM APPROACH ENVISAGED IN PAR 8A OF YOUR MESSAGE--NO MATTER HOW ADROITLY IT WAS CARRIED OUT--WOULD BE PROMPTLY IDENTIFIED AS RENEWED U.S. PRESSURE CAMPAIGN. THE RESULT COULD BE DISASTROUS, FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELIEF PROGRAM AND FOR OUR LONGER-TERM POSITION HERE. I MUST REPEAT THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE HERE. WITH FURTHER PROVOCATION, THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> ARE IN A MOOD, FOR EXAMPLE, TO EXCLUDE U.S. PERSONNEL ALTOGETHER FROM THE WAR AFFECTED AREA. VISITS BY DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL ARE ALREADY EFFECTIVELY BARRED.</p>
                        <p>3. IF THE FOREGOING ANALYSIS IS CORRECT--AND I BELIEVE EVERYONE IN THIS MISSION WOULD AGREE THAT IT IS--THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT OUR ONLY WAY OF IMPROVING THE NIGERIAN RELIEF OPERATION AND INDEED OF KEEPING ABREAST OF WHAT IS GOING ON IS BY USING THE TECHNICAL CHANNELS. EVEN THESE CAN BE OVERLOADED AND I HOPE THAT WITH THIS IN MIND WASHINGTON REQUIREMENTS FOR DETAILED INFORMATION CAN BE REFINED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d185-02" facs="d185-02"/>
                        <p>4. WHILE IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT NUTRITIONAL SITUATION IN FORMER ENCLAVE IS REASSURING, THE PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL SURVEYS (LATEST CONTAINED LAGOS 1692) HAVE CERTAINLY LED ME TO CONCLUSION THAT MASS STARVATION IS NOT IN PROSPECT AND THAT FEEDING PROBLEM WHICH WILL BE WITH US FOR LONG TIME IS BEING ADDRESSED WITH STEADILY INCREASING EFFECTIVENESS. I AM CONVINCED THAT LATTER CAN ONLY BE SET BACK BY RENEWED EFFORT TO CONVINCE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> OF QTE SERIOUSNESS OF PROBLEM UNQTE EXCEPT AS THIS CAN BE DONE INDIRECTLY AND THROUGH TECHNICAL/MEDICAL CHANNELS.</p>
                        <p>5. FOR WHAT IT MAY BE WORTH, THE BRITISH WHO HAVE MUCH AT STAKE HERE ARE FOLLOWING A POLICY COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH FOREGOING.</p>

                            <item>Sourcing of Nigerian [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Item of February 13</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Attached is the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report you requested which led to their judgment that the Biafrans may have reversed their attitudes towards the Central Nigerian Government.</p>
                        <p>I believe <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs evidence certainly warrants a judgment to that effect in relative terms. Perhaps their choice of language was less than judicious. On the other hand, I would be careful not to be overly impressed with ultra liberal attitudes which up until now had helped to keep the war going by their insistence that the Biafrans would be wiped out to a man if the Central Government prevailed. The overriding fact is that the Central Government, in terms of the liberalʼs predictions has been exceptionally moderate in its post-victory demeanor. Had we listened to these same voices several months ago, we would have done far more to prolong the war, the suffering and the killing than we did.</p>
                        <p>I think it is equally important from a self interest point of view, if nothing else, that we do not now start nitpicking the Central Government to the point of total alienation which can only be exploited by the Soviets. In short, I do not share <persName corresp="#p_MR2">ROGER MORRIS</persName>ʼ attitudes with respect to the plight of the Biafrans although I recognize they are largely justified from a humanitarian point of view. They are not, however, justified from a hard-nosed U.S. interest point of view.</p>

                            <item>Sourcing of Nigerian [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Item of 13 February</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Nigerian item [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] of 13 February was adapted from an article prepared for the Current Intelligence Bulletin of the same date. The <gloss target="#t_CIB1">CIB</gloss> article originated with the Nigerian specialists in the Office of Current Intelligence and was coordinated with the Department of State and the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p>
                        <p>2. The key judgments contained in the item--that in general, federal post war actions so far represent a sincere and reasonably successful attempt to implement the <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> governmentʼs reconciliation policy and that most Ibos recognize this and have been responding accordingly--are based on a mass of evidence which has accumulated since the civil war ended last month. There have, of course, been frictions and embittering incidents at the direct contact level. The overriding impression generated by the material coming in from all sources over the past three weeks, however, is that the basic relationship between victor and vanquished at this point is impressively good. The intelligence community believes that the federal relief program, whatever its deficiencies, has contributed importantly to this.</p>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] reports which were used as specific “sourcing” for the key judgments, because they constituted the most recently received and directly relevant evidence, are forwarded herewith. All of them, we believe, convey the basic message that the vast majority of former secessionists have been joyfully surprised by their treatment so far and are presently more than ready to pick up the pieces and resume their individual pursuits as Nigerians. Two of these reports (TDCS 314/01361 and TDCS 314/01385) refer specifically to the federal relief effort in this context.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d186-03" facs="d186-03"/>
                        <p>4. Underlying and basic to the present positive attitude of the Ibos is, of course, the fact that their defeat was not followed by their slaughter. Because the Ibosʼ fear of “genocide” was real enough, the mere failure of any type of large-scale violent retribution to materialize inculcated in them right from the beginning of the federal occupation a mass sense of relief which had to include feelings of gratitude toward Lagos. In this psychological climate, the fact that the federal government has not only begun to try to bring the defeated secessionists back into the Nigerian body politic on generous terms, but has even gone to what is surely regarded. by the conquered as extraordinary lengths to provide food and medical relief has clearly had a favorable impact.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> will be in Lagos, Nigeria, on February 18 and will see the head of the military government, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> seconds Ambassador TRUEHEARTʼs recommendation that the Secretary take the opportunity to deliver a personal message from you to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, and that he extend on your behalf an invitation to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to visit the United States at a date to be determined (Tab C).</p>
                        <p>Both of these steps are calculated to improve our relations with the Federal Military Government in Nigeria and specifically with General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. Our relations have been somewhat strained in recent weeks as <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has reacted to what he considers unfair and unwarranted criticism in the western press including that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> believes that he has acted magnanimously in his treatment of the vanquished secessionist Biafrans and that he is moving rapidly and effectively to meet the needs of the suffering in the former secessionist area. He considers that our pressures for greater relief efforts reflect a lack of confidence in him and his government.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that our best hope of a real and rapid improvement in the relief situation in the stricken areas of Eastern Nigeria lies in closer and more understanding relations with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and recommend therefore that you authorize Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to convey a letter from you to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> (Tab A).</p>
                        <p>At the same time we must recognize that relief efforts still are moving slowly and that we can help the Nigerians solve this problem. This may be the only opportunity we will have for a meaningful high-level dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> on the relief needs in Nigeria. Moreover, if we do not express continuing interest in relief efforts during the Secretaryʼs visit, our failure to do so may <pb n="2" xml:id="d187-02" facs="d187-02"/>be taken by <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his associates as evidence that we are wholly satisfied with progress thus far. Accordingly, I have revised Stateʼs draft letter to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to advise that you have asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to discuss ways in which we might be of assistance in Nigeriaʼs relief efforts.</p>
                        <p>An invitation to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to visit the United States at some future date would be a warm gesture and probably would be well received. It carries with it, however, some risk of unfavorable domestic reaction. Congressional voices, which are quiet for the moment, probably will be raised again if the momentum of the relief effort does not increase. If word of an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, however vague as to date, were to get out and progress on relief were inadequate we would be open to criticism for having taken such a step in the absence of satisfactory Nigerian moves on relief. The gesture, however, would help to establish the rapport we need if our relief efforts are to have prompt and full effect.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>That you authorize the Secretary to invite General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to visit the United States at a date to be determined later, but that no announcement of the invitation be made at this time. A draft cable for this purpose is at Tab B.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> reports on what he thinks to be a critical meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary reports that U.S.-Nigerian relations obviously have been strained as a result of our neutrality and sympathies expressed by many Americans and the press for Biafra during the Civil War. Pressures on relief since the war have added to the strain. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> believes the Nigerians sincerely want to get over these difficulties and seek improved relations. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> stressed that Nigeria purchased Soviet arms during the war only because they could not buy from the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> believes the Nigerians are sincere in their affirmation that Communism is foreign to their policy. He assured them that our policy toward Nigeria would not be motivated by concern over their attitude toward Communism. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> was pleased with your invitation to visit the United States and accepted it in principle. The Secretary believes we should quietly seek to assure that the visit occurs when the time is propitious.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> believes the relief problem is under control and wants to shift emphasis to rehabilitation and reconstruction by April. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> that our only interest was to be helpful and that we want to do so in ways Nigeria desires. The Secretary believes the relief problem is undoubtedly larger than the Nigerians in Lagos believe though not as extensive as some in the U.S. believe. The Secretary reports that the Embassy is clear on our objectives. He believes, however, that the Embassy should be given maximum flexibility to deal with the situation and our public involvement should be kept in as low key as possible in tight of Nigerian sensitivities. The Secretary hopes that we can give the increased aid Nigeria wants on a program basis to give Nigeria flexibility within an overall program agreeable to is.</p>

                        <p>1. I HAD WHAT I THINK WAS A CRITICAL MEETING WITH GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> IN NIGERIA. US-NIGERIAN RELATIONS HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN STRAINED AS A RESULT OF OUR NEUTRALITY DURING THE CIVIL WAR, AND THE SYMPATHY FOR BIAFRA OF SO MANY AMERICANS AND PRESS MEDIA. THE STRAIN HAS BEEN ADDED TO DURING THE RELIEF PHASE AFTER THE WAR AS OUR EXPERTS HAVE CONTINUED TO PRESS THE NIGERIANS ABOUT SERIOUS STARVATION PROBLEMS. GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> AND HIS ADVISERS TOLD ME THEY BELIEVE THE RELIEF PROBLEM IS UNDER CONTROL AND THEY WANT TO SHIFT INTO A REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION EMPHASIS BY APRIL.</p>
                        <p>2. MOST OF THE REACTIONS TO OUR ATTITUDES WERE EXPRESSED TO ME BY ADMIRAL WEY, COL. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">JOHNSON</persName> (GOVERNOR OF LAGOS STATE) AND COMMISSIONER OKUNNO PRIOR TO MY MEETING WITH GEN. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName>. I BELIEVE IT WAS ORGANIZED THAT WAY. EACH OF THEM STRESSED THE DESIRE OF NIGERIA FOR CLOSE TIES WITH THE US. BUT EACH OF THEM ALSO STRESSED NIGERIAN PUBLIC OPINION HAD BEEN SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED IN OUR ATTITUDES DURING THE WAR -- REFUSAL TO LET THEM PURCHASE WEAPONS AND OUR DECLARATION OF “NEUTRALITY”. SO THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED IN OUR RELATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. ON THE OTHER HAND, I ALSO AM CONFIDENT THEY WANT TO GET OVER THIS DIFFICULTY AS MUCH AS WE DO. THE KEYNOTE TO THIS WAS GEN. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName>ʼS STATEMENT AT THE END OF OUR MEETING (TWO HOURS) THAT HE “CHERISHED THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS WITH THE US -- THAT NIGERIA HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. “ THE GENERAL ALSO SAID PUBLICLY AT THE CLOSE OF OUR DISCUSSION THAT OUR VISIT <pb n="3" xml:id="d188-03" facs="d188-03"/>(MONROVIA 0846) “AUGURED” WELL FOR THE FUTURE OF US-<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> RELATIONS. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> DID NO MORE THAN ALLUDE TO THE STRAINS, BUT HE DID TALK CONSIDERABLY ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS CAUSED BY DISTORTING INFORMATION.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> WAS PLEASED WITH YOUR INVITATION AND ACCEPTED IT IN PRINCIPLE NOTING HE HAD BEEN TO THE US ONCE BEFORE. DETAILS CAN BE FOLLOWED UP THROUGH THE EMBASSY WHEN THE TIME COMES. I THINK THE VISIT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO OVERCOME THE STRAINS AND BELIEVE WE SHOULD QUIETLY SEEK TO ASSURE IT COMES ABOUT.</p>
                        <p>5. NIGERIA WOULD LIKE INCREASED U.S. AID TO HELP THEM RECONSTRUCT. THEY MENTIONED ROADS, BRIDGES, PORT DEVELOPMENT AND PRE-FABRICATED BUILDINGS FOR DISPLACED PERSONS. THEY WOULD LIKE AID ON A “PROGRAM” RATHER THAN “PROJECT” BASIS, WHICH WILL GIVE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY SPEND IT (WITHIN AN OVERALL PROGRAM AGREEABLE TO US). I HOPE WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON THE BASIS OF SPECIAL POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION, AS IT WOULD ALSO HELP RESTORE OUR POSITION.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> AND OTHERS STRESSED THAT THEIR PURCHASE OF SOVIET ARMS ONLY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BUY FROM THE U.S. OR <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> AND THAT COMMUNISM WAS FOREIGN TO NIGERIAN POLICY. I BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE SINCERE. I ASSURED THEM OUR POLICY WOULD NOT BE MOTIVATED BY CONCERN ABOUT THEIR INTENTIONS RE COMMUNISM AND THAT WE UNDERSTOOD THEIR PURCHASES.</p>
                        <p>7. I ASSURED <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> THAT OUR ONLY INTEREST WAS TO BE HELPFUL AND THAT WE WANTED TO DO SO IN THE WAYS THAT THEY DESIRED. I THINK HE APPRECIATED OUR ATTITUDE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF OUR FREE PRESS AND PUBLIC OPINION, THEY ARE AWARE THAT BIAFRAN PUBLIC INFORMATION ACTIVITIES IN THE US WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR OWN.</p>
                        <p>8. THERE UNDOUBTEDLY IS A LARGER RELIEF PROBLEM IN THE BIAFRAN-HET.T) AREAS THAN THEY SEEM TO BELIEVE IN LAGOS, THOUGH PROBABLY NOT AS EXTENSIVE AS SOME AT HOME BELIEVE. WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HELP TO MEET THAT AS BEST WE CAN. HOWEVER, THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE ABOUT THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND TIRING OF HEARING <pb n="4" xml:id="d188-04" facs="d188-04"/>(MONROVIA 0846) FOREIGNERS TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO. IF WE PRESS OUR OWN JUDGMENTS ON THEM TOO STRONGLY EITHER THROUGH DIPLOMATIC OR TECHNICAL CHANNELS, IT WILL HAVE LASTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR RELATIONS. THE EMBASSY IS CLEAR ON OUR OBJECTIVES AND ON THE STATE OF OUR PUBLIC OPINION, BUT I BELIEVE WE MUST LEAVE THEM MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY AND KEEP OUR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN AS LOW KEY AS POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>9. I HAVE JUST RECEIVED PRESS COVERAGE REPORTS FROM LAGOS. THEY WERE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND, IN MOST CASES, FRIENDLY.</p>

                            <item>Nigeria Relief - Progress Report</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A is Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>ʼs latest progress report on Nigerian relief.</p>
                        <p>The report is distressing in that distribution of relief food during the week ending February 28 totalled only 3, 200 tons as contrasted with the Nigerian Red Cross goal of 4,200 tons a week and our own expertsʼ estimate of a weekly need of 9,000 tons. Moreover, there was no increase over the previous week. Serious distribution problems persist in the area of most critical need. Our Embassy has been instructed to ascertain and report the causes for this situation and remedies which can be pursued.</p>
                        <p>Efforts continue to convince Nigerian medical and relief officials of the need for a feeding target of 9, 000 tons per week based upon earlier estimates of the Western report, which has been confirmed by a joint Nigerian-U.S. nutritional survey now being reviewed by the Nigerian Red Cross and Ministries of Economic Development and Health. To this end, a U.S. doctor who participated in the joint survey will return to Nigeria next week to present his recommendations.</p>
                        <p>A complicating factor which we have foreseen for some time will be the transfer over the next two months of relief responsibilities from the Nigerian Red Cross to the Rehabilitation Commissions of the three states in Eastern Nigeria. The states have neither the organization, personnel nor motivation of the Red Cross and their involvement can be expected to result in at least a temporary slow down, if not serious impasse, in the relief effort. The Rehabilitation Commissions are also noted for their corruption, and relief through them is likely to become a political instrument to entrench present state government. Our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> mission is attempting to establish close working relations between U.S. personnel in the field and these rehabilitation commissions to try to mitigate these effects of the transfer of responsibility from the Red Cross.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d189-02" facs="d189-02"/>
                        <p>In a similar setback, the Nigerian Red Cross has decided to terminate services of U.S. National Communicable Disease Center doctors in the relief effort. However, large numbers of Nigerian medical personnel are now at work and a number of other countries are providing additional medical personnel in response to Nigerian requests. And we are proposing to the Nigerian Ministry of Health that doctors from our Communicable Disease Center be assigned to the three states in Eastern Nigeria to revive the important small pox-measles control programs there. These doctors also would be in a position to monitor and assist in relief programs.</p>
                        <p>As for further relief supplies, we are offering housing and road reconstruction help which will be increasingly important to the overall relief effort. A U.S. housing expert is already in Nigeria. Additional agricultural technicians are being furnished to assist in large scale food planting programs, which should get underway without delay before the onset of the rainy season in late spring.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the Nigerian relief effort has made tangible progress since the first chaotic days in January after Biafraʼs fall, but the tonnage delivered still falls far short of our own expertsʼ estimates of need, and is less than even the modest Nigerian target. Ahead are developments which will hinder more than help efforts to improve on this. Our Embassy has been told to move to try to offset hinderances, but our influence is marginal at this point. No one has tried to measure the impact of all this in terms of mortality. But it has been two full months since the end of the war, and the 3-1/2 million the Western Report found in need have yet to get 1/2 the weekly tonnage estimated as necessary.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <list type="subject">
                            <head>Subject:</head>
                            <item>Interdepartmental Operations Group on Nigeria--Progress Report</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Distribution of relief food in eastern Nigeria is gradually increasing. For the week ending February 28, available figures indicate distribution of somewhat more than 3,200 tons, nearly double the highest sustained level achieved by the airlift. On the other hand, these figures, for the first time, show no increase over the previous week, raising the question of whether the Nigerians will be able to reach their own 4,200 ton a week feeding target in the next several weeks. Very serious distribution problems persist, particularly in the Owerri area.</p>
                        <p>It is doubtful whether we will be able to persuade the Nigerians to raise their feeding target even though it falls substantially short of the 9,000 tons per week our nutritionists consider desirable. Our experts are still negotiating with the Federal health authorities on interpretation of the recent U.S.-Nigerian nutritional survey. We have, however, nearly exhausted our influence during our effort of the past few weeks. Nigerian sensitivities are now such that further pressures are likely to be self-defeating. On the other hand, we will be able to continue our efforts to assure that, within the goals the Nigerians have set, the most efficient possible relief job is actually accomplished.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, an immediate problem is the Nigerian Governmentʼs decision to take the Nigerian Red Cross out of the relief program in April and May, and to <pb n="4" xml:id="d189-04" facs="d189-04"/>hand over primary responsibility for both relief and rehabilitation to the state governments. This decision reflects both the shift of Nigerian emphasis from relief to the next phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction and the assertion of state authority in the balance of state-Federal political power in Nigeria. How well the states will conduct relief will depend on whether they will be able to take over and effectively use the existing Red Cross relief system. Relief efforts may be impaired until state governments learn from experience the magnitude of the continuing need and develop some competence in dealing with it.</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians value our help in rehabilitation. In-creased assistance in this field will contribute to better relations as well as a more rapid recovery of the war-affected area. More important, it may provide the most practical way for us to have some influence on the state relief programs.</p>
                        <p>We are therefore seeking to strengthen and enlarge our working relations with state governments and get more of our people directly involved in their relief and rehabilitation programs along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Rehabilitation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Following up General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs expressed interest to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, we are offering the Federal Government help in housing and road reconstruction. We have several emergency rehabilitation projects already under way in the war-affected area, will provide an additional six to eight million dollars there during Fiscal 1970 and are requesting additional sums for Fiscal 1971. For example, UNICEF is now discussing with the Nigerians a school restoration project which we will support and which might include a school feeding program.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Nigerian Red Cross has decided to terminate the services of U.S. National Communicable Disease Center (NCDC) doctors in the relief effort. We are, however, proposing to the Nigerians that NCDC doctors assist in reviving smallpox-measles programs in the three war-affected states. By this means, we would hope they could informally monitor and assist in the state relief programs in the course of their work.</p>
                        <p>At Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs request, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> will return to Lagos this month to submit final recommendations on a nutritional survey in which he participated. His influence there, based on close and long relations with the Nigerian health authorities, could conceivably be helpful in obtaining a more liberal Nigerian decision on feeding requirements.</p>

                        <p>We are supporting yam and maize planting programs and the supply of agricultural tools. We also expect to place additional <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> agricultural technicians and U.S.-financed CARE agricultural specialists to work in the field.</p>

                        <p>1. OVERALL SITUATION CONTINUES TO IMPROVE WITH LOCAL MARKET INCREASINGLY PROVIDING FOODSTUFFS IN SOME AREAS. CONDITIONS VARY, OF COURSE, AND PLACES REMAIN WHERE CONTINUATION RELIEF PROGRAM ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT RELAPSE TO SITUATION OF CRITICAL NEED. SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AREA, BETWEEN AND ITU (LAGOS 3020). NRC PROGRESS REPORT (LAGOS 2992) FOUND ABAKALIKI AND NSUKKA AREAS TO HAVE LITTLE FUTURE REQUIREMENTS WHILE OWERRI AREA WILL NEED FOOD RELIEF UNTIL AUTUMN HARVEST. AT SAME TIME, AID OFFICIAL FOUND DRAMATIC DECLINE IN SEVERE MALNUTRITION IN OWERRI AREA, EVIDENCED BY REDUCTION OF SICK BAYS AND INPATIENTS. SIMILAR SITUATION FOUND IN AREA BUSH CLINICS. ADDITION OF TRUCK TONNAGE VIA PORT HARCOURT PLUS LARGE ARRIVAL OF BEANS FROM NORTH YIELDED FIRST-TIME RESERVE OF SOME ITEMS FOR OWERRI. EUROPEAN RELIEF WORKER WHO REMAINED IN ENCLAVE DURING WAR SAID MORE FOOD NOW REACHING MORE PEOPLE WITH LESS FAVORITISM, PILFERAGE AND CORRUPTION THAN DURING WAR. FORMER REGISTRAR ON STAFF IBADAN UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL WHO HEADS MEDICAL TEAM IN OWERRI AREA SAID NUTRITIONAL SITUATION NOW NO WORSE THAN WESTERN STATE. IN THIS CONNECTION, INTERESTING THAT NIGERAIN <pb n="2" xml:id="d190-02" facs="d190-02"/>TELEVISION THIS WEEK RAN FIFTEEN MINUTE PROGRAM ON RELIEF EFFORT AND CONDITION OF PEOPLE IN WAR-AFFECTED AREA. FOOTAGE, WHICH INCLUDED SOME DEPRESSING SIGHTS TO UNINITIATED WESTERN OBSERVER, PRESUMABLY ACCEPTABLE AS NORMAL TO NIGERIANS. INCIDENTALLY, PROGRAM PICTORIALLY DISPLAYED MOSTLY BRITISH RELIEF CONTRIBUTION AND SPECIFICALLY “EXPOSED” ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS BY TIME MAGAZINE ABOUT CONDITIONS IN AREA.</p>
                        <p>2. RESTOCKING OF FOOD IMPORTS DESTINED FOR ENUGU AND THOSE IN TRANSIT REPORTED LAGOS 2925. LAGOS 3020 AND 3041 REPORT INCREASED MOVEMENT LOCAL FOODSTUFFS INTO SOME AREAS OF E-C STATE MARKET -- PARTICULARLY NORTH. SITUATION MAY IMPROVE EVEN MORE WITH OPENING OF ASABA-ONITSHA BRIDGE TODAY. LAGOS 2931 GIVE AMOUNTS, WHERE PURCHASED AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENT OF AID SEED PROGRAM; LAGOS 2926 PARA 6 REPORTS OBSERVATIONS OF SEED DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.</p>
                        <p>3. LAGOS 2969 REPORTS WAR DAMAGES TO HOSPITALS. NRC REPORT (LAGOS 2992) FOUND E-C STATE MINHEALTH PUTTING MORE HOSPITALS INTO OPERATION STAFFED BY INCREASING NUMBER OF IBO PROFESSIONALS. REPORT IMPLIES HOSPITALS AND OTHER CLINICAL FACILITIES PROVIDING ADEQUATE CARE TO ABOUT 25 THOUSAND INPATIENTS IN ORLU-OWERRI AREA, BUT SITUATION IN BUSH CLINICS LESS FAVORABLE.</p>
                        <p>4. EVALUATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN E-C STATE BEYOND DISTRICT LEVEL REPORTED SO FAR AS OBSERVED IN LAGOS 3020 ANDY 2926. EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE ATTEMPT FULLER, MORE DETAILED EVALUATION BUT POINTS OUT THIS SENSITIVE POLITICAL MATTER AS WELL AS RELIEF QUESTION WITH E-C STATE GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD NOT WELCOME INDICATIONS OF CONSPICUOUS CONCERN WITH LEVEL OF DISTRIBUTION PROCESS WHICH THEY ALONE INTEND TO CONTROL AND WHICH LOCAL AID PERSONNEL HAVE THIN JURISDICTIONAL REASON TO MONITOR. MOREOVER, PASSES FOR AID PERSONNEL TO VISIT E-C STATE LIMITED TO THOSE WITH DEMONSTRATED SPECIFIC TECHNICAL MiSSION -- E.G., HELICOPTERS, GENERATORS, HOUSING, ETC.</p>
                        <p>5. PROBLEM OF NRC-STATE REHAB COMM RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES AS REPORTED LAST WEEKLY RELIEF ROUNDUP. NRC REPORT (LAGOS 2992) SPELLED OUT ITS INTENTION OT DISENGAGE BUT AGAIN REQUESTED <pb n="3" xml:id="d190-03" facs="d190-03"/>E-C STATE TO RECONSIDER TIMETABLE, ESPECIALLY RE QTE EMERGENCY RELIEF AREAS UNQTE. NRC ALSO ASKED THAT FIELD TEAMS AND SPONSORING AGENCIES BE INVITED CONTINUE IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH STATE GOVTS AND RED CROSS BRANCHES FOR ODERLY TRANSITION.</p>
                        <p>6. LAGOS 3022 REPORTED SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RELIEF AND REHAB COMMODITIES ESTABLISHED BY USAID. SYSTEM DESIGNED TO MONITOR ALL COMMODITY ITEMS FROM RECEIPT AT DOCK OR AIRPORT THROUGH INTERNAL TRANSSHIPMENT TO POINT OF USE. WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST FED AND STATE AUTHORITIES TO MAINTAIN RECORDS THIS PROPERTY.</p>
                        <p>7. DESCRIPTION GENERAL CONDITIONS E-C STATE ECONOMY AND POPULATION PROVIDED LAGOS 3020 AND 3041. FOLLOWING CENTRAL BANK INSTRUCTIONS, LARGE VOLUME BIAFRAN CURRENCY BEING COLLECTED FOR DEPOSIT BY CENTRAL BANK TEAMS USING VAULTS OF LOCAL BANKS IN INITIAL STAGE EVENTUAL CURRENCY CONVERSION WHOSE TERMS STILL UNANNOUNCED. DESPITE SLOWNESS CONVERSION PROCESS, SPENDING BY GOVT, MILITARY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR SEEMS TO HAVE GENERATED ENOUGH NIGERIAN CURRENCY TO SPUR INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY BY MAJOR TRADING COMPANIES AND SMALL IBO TRADERS ALIKE, BOTH, BUILDING UP BANK BALANCES. ENUGU BUSINESS ACTIVITY ESTIMATED BY ONE BANKER AHEAD OF PORT HARCOURT. ELSEWHERE, MARKET ACTIVITY LOWER WITH SOME TRADERS MOVING TO NORTHERN PART OF STATE WHILE OTHERS CONTINUE ACCEPT BIAFRAN MONEY IN BUSH AREAS. LAGOS 3023 REPORTS UNICEF DRAFT PROGRAM FOR DOLLARS 4.9 MILLION ON EDUCATION, HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROJECTS IN WAR-AFFECTED AREAS.

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">George Lythcott</persName>, who led the Nutritional Survey Mission in Nigeria in February and has very good, long-standing relationships with Nigerian health officials, is in Lagos again this week for a final, important consultation. His mission is to try to influence Nigerian health officials, on the basis of the February survey, to take certain further actions to meet the serious problems that may still lie ahead in the relief program.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador TRUEHEART has now expressed grave concern as to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName>ʼs proceeding with these consultations even though it had been previously agreed between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> and the Nigerians that he would return for a further discussion of the nutritional problem. TRUEHEART believes, despite Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName>ʼs status in Lagos, that further conversations along this line could seriously damage our already strained relationships with the Ministry of Health and that <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName>ʼs scheduled trip to the war-affected area is also inadvisable.</p>
                        <p>We have informed Ambassador TRUEHEART that we believe Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> should proceed with his mission as far as the Nigerians will permit and that the Embassy should support him in his efforts. There is serious concern here, in the White House and among the Public Health nutritionists who have been working on the Nigerian problem, that, unless the relief program is further strengthened, there may be substantial deterioration in the feeding situation in the East.</p>
                        <p>If Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> is unable to carry out the mission for which he has gone to Lagos, we will again have reached a point where Nigerian sensitivities and the concern felt here about the situation are in direct conflict. In that event, we may need to consult with you in a day or two on next steps.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A is a front-page story from todayʼs Star by James Doyle which clearly derives from a leak of a sensitive nutritional survey done by U.S. and Nigerian doctors in February.</p>
                        <p>This leak could have serious consequences for the relief effort and our continued role in it. The Nigerians have been very sensitive about data on conditions in the war-affected areas, and particularly so about implied U.S. criticism that not enough is being done. They were persuaded to undertake this survey only with great difficulty, and the whole process has required delicate diplomacy by our doctors. We agreed, for example, that any announcement of survey results would come only from the Nigerians themselves.</p>
                        <p>This leak is doubly unfortunate because, after further hard work by our doctors, the Nigerians had substantially agreed with the findings of the survey and were to publish it themselves in the next couple of days. Moreover, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> had overcome resistance to the presence of U.S. doctors and persuaded the three states in the Eastern region to ask for U.S. doctors to advise their Ministries of Health. This important move may well be killed.</p>
                        <p>Letting the Nigerians take credit would have given maximum benefit by way of operational results of the survey. The situation in the former enclave remains very serious, and the Nigerians need to recognize and act on that. But now there is the great risk that they will recoil as usual from foreign criticism. Not only will they probably shrink from taking further measures they might have adopted, but they may also see the leak as bad faith on our part and seriously curtail, if not end, our role in relief -- which would be a serious blow to further progress which is certainly needed to save those who have survived thus far.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d192-02" facs="d192-02"/>
                        <p>The Doyle leak apparently comes from a draft report of the nutritional survey which has been circulated by the Public Health people in Atlanta to the doctors who participated, but not yet to anyone here in Washington. State is getting a report posthaste from Atlanta.</p>
                        <p>Other elements of the story indicate, however, that Doyle also got some inside information that would not have been available in the draft report.</p>
                        <p>As for press handling here, State is adopting a low key approach, avoiding a formal statement and backgrounding only those who ask about the story. We agree this makes sense. We have given Zeigler on an “if asked” basis a brief statement which (1) recognizes Nigerian efforts and progress to date, (2) points out there are factual errors in the report, and (3) refers the questioner to State for details.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> called at his request to deliver a three-prong complaint against U.S. behavior and attitudes during the postwar period. These concerned the leak of information about the nutritional survey published by the Evening Star on April 7, alleged preferential treatment given Ibos in visa matters, and the current activities of “Biafran” organizations in soliciting money.</p>
                        <p>Claiming that the Star leak was carried by Reuters and therefore widely known in Nigeria, <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> indicated that his Government viewed this matter with concern and might be driven to refuse to permit any American doctors to come to or remain in Nigeria if they couldnʼt be trusted not to leak state information. He was assured that we and the CDC doctors have honored our commitment to the Nigerian Government that the results of the survey were to be released only by the Nigerian Government, and that we could not account for the leak. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs inclination was to blame Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName> but he was given copies of <persName corresp="#p_LDG1">Lythcott</persName>ʼs angry letter to the Star and his apologetic letter to Dr. Silva of the Ministry of Health in Lagos. While still suspicious, Iyalla was mollified to some extent.</p>
                        <p>On the visa question, <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> requested that henceforth former “Biafrans” no longer receive preferential treatment but be handled in exactly the same way as any other Nigerian. He alleged that many Ibos had been given open-ended visas, that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> participant grantees were permitted to remain indefinitely in the United States after completing their training unlike other Nigerians and that in general Ibos <pb n="2" xml:id="d193-02" facs="d193-02"/>were being favored. He said that by ceasing to accord them preferential treatment, the U.S. Government could help impress upon all Ibos the fact that the rebellion had failed and that their future lay in Nigeria, where they were welcome, and whence they should return to put their talents to good use. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> was assured that the entire matter would be reviewed but at the same time he was asked to clarify for us the position of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> with regard to its willingness to pick up the educational costs of Ibo and other Nigerian students in this country who are presently in need. He promised to do so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> brought with him an advertisement placed in the New York Times of April 12, 1970 by the Biafra International Foundation (342 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017) sponsored by the Biafra Association in the Americas Inc. on Behalf of the Biafran Community. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs complaint related to the fact that the advertisement indicated that contributions would be tax deductible and that they were intended to “(A) aid the settlement of stranded Biafran refugees in the United States and abroad and (B) aid in the rehabilitation of our brothers and sisters at home--to enable them to achieve peace and equal treatment under their present conditions.” Iyalla said that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would be hardput to understand how contributions to such an organization could be considered tax deductible and that in any event the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would flatly refuse to let any funds collected by such an organization be sent to Nigeria. He categorized the organization as fraudulent and said further that such activities simply contribute to the irrationality of those who refuse to believe that the rebellion has failed. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> was told that we would check into the bonafides of the organization and check whether in fact it enjoyed tax exempt status. (Subsequent check with Treasury has indicated that it is not tax exempt. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> was so informed. We are proceeding with a further investigation.)</p>

                        <p rend="center">NIGERIA AFTER THE WAR</p>
                        <p>With the civil war over and secession decisively defeated, the federal military government is now attempting the complex task of rebuilding Nigeria, Africaʼs most populous country. Winning the war in itself was a considerable achievement for General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs government, but the basic problems that brought about the political upheaval in the first place remain unsolved. The old federal system, which was designed to accommodate the power relationships among the three main tribal groupings, was unable to cope with those problems. The elements now in control believe that this system was actually a major contributor to the political crisis. The new leaders, who are from small tribes, are determined to fashion a new structure that will prevent a return to big-tribe domination. Some steps have already been taken in this direction, but the men in charge are still feeling their way and probably remain unsure about the best way to achieve their objectives. In foreign affairs, the new Nigeria is clearly more nationalistic and assertive than its predecessor, although <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs government will probably continue to follow a pragmatic policy with no major departures. At the same time, the Nigerians are likely to remain suspicious of all foreign powers.</p>
                        <p>THE POSTWAR SITUATION</p>
                        <p>The federal army has remained in firm control of the former Eastern Region — the original secessionist territory — since the abrupt end of the war some four months ago. No guerrilla warfare has occurred, and the possibility of any developing is remote. Banditry, probably by ex-soldiers, has increased recently in the southwestern part of the Ibo East Central State, but at present it does not seem likely that this will get out of hand. Most of the secessionist soldiers joined groups of refugees or returned to their villages when the war ended, while a large number of officers and noncommissioned officers turned themselves in to be screened for reabsorption into the army.</p>
                        <p>A large occupation force remains in the former secessionist territory, but these troops have been kept out of the main towns wherever possible. Most routine law-and-order functions are carried out by the Nigeria Police, which include some reinstated Ibos.</p>
                        <p>By the time the war ended, the Nigerian Army had grown to some 200,000 men, among them many untrained recruits. Since then, there have been some violent incidents between army troops and civilians and police, mainly in the North. There has been vague talk of the need to demobilize, but the federal leaders are in no hurry to do so, and Nigeria is likely to have a relatively large standing army for some time to come.</p>
                        <p>The federal military government emerged from the war in a strong political position, with Gowon something of a national hero. At present, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs leadership faces no serious challenge, and [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] reports indicate that he is be coming increasingly more confident and decisive. Although he has disavowed any personal political ambitions, all indications are that he intends to stick as head of the government until it is <pb n="4" xml:id="d194-04" facs="d194-04"/>[map of States and Tribal Groups of Nigeria] <pb n="5" xml:id="d194-05" facs="d194-05"/>returned to civilian rule – a move unlikely to occur for another two years or more. Gowon recently spoke of several time-consuming procedures, possibly including a census, that would have to precede the return. In early May, the federal government issued a decree formally placing itself above the law and prohibiting judicial review of any of its orders. This move was probably designed to remind the Nigerians of the absolute supremacy of the military government and to end any notion that the old civilian parliament might be revived.</p>
                        <p>Secessionist leader <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName> is in Ivory Coast, where he is seeking to keep an organization together. He has been in contact with the handful of other Biafran leaders abroad, some of whom have ambitious–albeit unrealistic–plans to influence events at home. Ojukwu probably retains support among many lbo tribesmen in Nigeria, but there is virtually no likelihood that they would answer a call from him to renew the secession attempt. Unless the occupation suddenly takes a turn for the worse, which is unlikely, <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>ʼs political future will remain dim.</p>
                        <p>RECONCILIATION POLICY</p>
                        <p>At warʼs end, Lagos announced a conciliatory policy toward the secessionists, including the absorption of “misguided” army and police officers and the reinstatement of civil servants. Several thousand ex-Biafran policemen have already been reinstated, and some have been reassigned as far away as Lagos. A federal military tribunal has been established to screen army officers, but thus far none is known to have been reabsorbed. According to a recent [text not declassified] report, a few officers have been cleared and allowed to return to civilian life. The highest ranking secessionist officer, Colonel Ernong, has been placed under “protective custody.”</p>
                        <p>The reintegration of eastern civil servants has also been proceeding, although at a slow pace. In mid-May, a federal official announced that slightly over 1,000 had been formally reinstated; over half of these people were posted outside the East Central State, with nearly 200 going to four of the northern states. These represent the first group of easterners to return to the north, where over a million had lived before the war.</p>
                        <p>One federal program that has done much to convince the Ibos that Lagos was serious about reconciliation has been the food relief effort. The actual food situation in the three eastern states has never been accurately determined, but the Nigerian Red Cross INRC) has been providing at least some food to 2-3 million people since shortly after the end of the war. The massive program was reduced this month, and the NRCʼs role may possibly end after June, at which time the remaining problem of food relief would be turned over to the state. State administrations are not as well organized as the NRC, and there will probably be an increase in malnutrition if the NRC is phased out. Whether the NRC will continue after 30 June has not yet been finally decided.</p>
                        <p>Although the East Central State has an Ibo civilian administrator, he was appointed by Gowon during the war and is probably regarded as a quisling by most Ibos. Moreover, many of the present local officials were either recruited during the war or were simply the first people to meet the advancing federal troops. Thus far, the Ibo tribesmen have been preoccupied with making the best of a difficult economic situation, and little dissatisfaction over the state administration is evident. At some point, however, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> may well see the political need to appoint officials more acceptable to the Ibo masses; such officials would have to include some who supported secession.</p>
                        <p>There are sizable elements within the government that oppose <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs conciliatory policy <pb n="6" xml:id="d194-06" facs="d194-06"/>and believe the Ibos should be punished. In addition, the non-lbo tribesmen now in control in Rivers and South Eastern states, as well as many northern tribesmen, are convinced that too much is being done for the former enemy. These elements seem to have persuaded <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> of the need for a cautious approach to the reintegration of the Ibos, but it is unlikely that he would adopt a really vindictive policy.</p>
                        <p>THE ECONOMIC PICTURE</p>
                        <p>Apart from a troublesome price inflation and a somewhat precarious foreign exchange situation, Nigeria has emerged from the war in generally good economic condition. The federal goernment did not incur any external war debts, and what problems exist certainly seem manageable. On the plus side is the rise in oil production, which last April reached one million barrels per day, nearly double the prewar high. The rapid development of manufacturing industries outside the old Eastern Region is also promising.</p>
                        <p>In contrast with the rest of the federation, the three eastern states were economically prostrate at the end of the war. Production facilities were extensively damaged, many bridges were destroyed, and the electric power system required major repairs. A serious, immediate problem exists over the shortage of federal currency in the East Central State. The government has collected what it could of the now-illegal Biafran money, but it has not yet decided whether to effect an exchange with Nigerian currency. A considerable amount of federal money has been filtering into the East Central State as a result of spending by Nigerian Army troops, by relief officials, and by traders from other parts of the country.</p>
                        <p>Another major economic problem is caused by the fact that most of the Ibo tribesmen are crowded into the East Central State, which even before the war could not support them all. Some have returned to Lagos, Mid-Western, and Western states, and a small number have gone back to the north. Ibos are clearly unwelcome, however, in Rivers and South Eastern states, which are controlled by vehemently anti-Ibo tribes. This situation will slow the recovery of places such as Port Harcourt, which had been a predominantly Ibo city before the war. Thus far, failure to tackle the problem of what to do with the ambitious and generally well-educated Ibos has not caused widespread discontent among them, but their continuing restriction remains an element of potential instability.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName> AND HIS CONSTITUENCY</p>
                        <p>Federal leaders are aware of the economic and political problems of the three eastern states, but they view reconstruction in terms of the whole federation. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his closest associates are trying to use this period to reshape Nigeriaʼs economic and political institutions to accommodate the profound transformation of power relationships that occurred as a result of <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs taking over the leadership in August 1966.</p>
                        <p>Nigeria had become independent six years earlier under a system designed to reflect the predominance of the countryʼs three main tribal groupings
–the Muslim Hausa-Fulanis of the north, the Yorubas of the west, and the Ibos of the east. At the same time, there were sizable numbers of minority tribesmen throughout the federation, particularly in the north and the east. In January 1966, the thoroughly corrupt civilian regime through which the big-tribe system functioned was destroyed in a coup dʼetat by young, southern officers. Six months later, the succeeding Ibo-dominated military government was itself overthrown by northern army elements who turned to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, the ranking northern officer, <pb n="7" xml:id="d194-07" facs="d194-07"/>for leadership. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> was not from the Northern Regionʼs traditionally dominant Hausa-Fulani group but rather was a minority tribesman and a Christian.</p>
                        <p>[picture of Major General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">YAKUBU GOWON</persName>, Head of Federal Military Government]</p>
                        <p>Since taking over, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has developed a powerful constituency among the many minority tribesmen whose leaders seized on his accession to power to secure their aim of ending the domination by the three big tribes. Through their control of the army, these minority tribesmen now hold real power in the federal government, and they are determined not to give it up. The actual exercise of this power is carried out at the federal level by <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his small “kitchen cabinet” of civilian and military advisers, all of whom are either minority tribesmen or are in sympathy with them.</p>
                        <p>In May 1967, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> decreed the breakup of the four administrative regions of the federation into 12 states, a move clearly designed to dilute the power of the large tribes. This action, aimed particularly at freeing minority areas of the old Eastern Region from domination by the Ibos, triggered the declaration of secession toward which <persName corresp="#p_OLCCO1">Ojukwu</persName>, who never recognized <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs leadership, had long been moving. Thus, to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his constituency. the federal victory in the war represents the completion of an internal revolution.</p>
                        <p>There is, of course, opposition to the minority tribesmenʼs objectives. The first generation of Nigerian politicians, whose careers were made in big-tribe politics, are by no means resigned to a secondary role. At this point, however, there is little they can do to change things. The most prominent and ambitious of these surviving first-generation politicians is Chief Awolowo, leader of the Yorubas. The aging Awolowo, however, has far too many enemies, including many among the minority tribesmen, to be considered a likely contender for leadership of an eventual civilian government. In northern Nigeria, a number of old-line Hausa-Fulani politicos have been holding meetings with some of their counterparts from local minority tribes to plan political strategy. This grouping now seems mainly to be trying to block Awolowoʼs accession to power. It does include some rich and powerful politicians, however, who are anticipating a return to civilian rule. The new state structure has also provoked opposition among traditional local leaders, particularly in the far north, who had considerable power under the old system.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d194-08" facs="d194-08"/>
                        <p>[table of the 12-State Structure]</p>
                        <p>As far as <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his constituency are concerned, however, the only question is whethermore states should be created and, if so, how many. There is a good chance that the Western State, the homeland of the Yorubas and the power base of Chief Awolowo, will be broken up into two or perhaps three states. One faction of the Yoruba tribe wants this, but Chief Awolowo opposes it. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> does not like or trust Awolowo, however, and he will probably break up the Western State if only to undermine Awolowo. It is also possible that the North Eastern State and perhaps some others will be split. The question of forcing new states could, of course, be passed on to an eventual civilian government, but <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his colleagues certainly realize that it could most easily be handled by decree; there are no signs that such a decree will be forthcoming in the immediate future, however.</p>
                        <p>Another thorny problem <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> may want to settle by decree is that of a permanent formula for the distribution of federal revenue. Last March, the government implemented a revenue <pb n="9" xml:id="d194-09" facs="d194-09"/>distribution scheme that moved toward a more equitable distribution of funds to all parts of the federation in place of the old system favoring the rich areas. There is a considerable disparity in resources among the 12 states, and it seems likely that Gowon will eventually ensure a revenue distribution system protecting the poorer states.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p>
                        <p>The government seems inclined to continue the basically pragmatic foreign policy adopted during the war. Federal leaders have not forgotten that they paid in full for all the military weapons they acquired from the Soviet Union. Since the war, Lagos has canceled orders from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the military leaders have never been enthusiastic about expanding ties with the Communists. Nevertheless, the fact that some civilian elements want closer relations with the Soviets, and that even the military see the need for a friendlier attitude toward Moscow, could result in closer economic and cultural ties. Indeed, in late 1968, a general economic agreement was signed with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> setting the stage for future Soviet-aided projects. The Soviet Union has sent some technicians and geological experts to Nigeria but has not yet undertaken any economic aid projects.</p>
                        <p>The Nigerian Government remains favorably disposed toward the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, but is suspicious of the US, which is generally believed to have given moral–if not material–support to the secessionists. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> wants correct diplomatic relations with the US, however, and will probably continue to work to convince his colleagues that this is a wise course to follow.</p>
                        <p>Nigeria has shown some signs of adopting a more activist policy in Africa. Although the present government is unlikely to undertake any dramatic initiatives, Lagos could well step up its propaganda and material support for black nationalist movements in southern Africa. Such support would fit well with the idea that Nigeriaʼs military suppression of a foreign-backed attempt to divide Africaʼs largest country redounded to the advantage of the “Black Man,” a recurrent theme in recent propaganda out of Lagos.</p>
                        <p>OUTLOOK</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians emerged from the war with a much-increased consciousness of national unity, and there is no reason to believe that this attitude will soon disappear. It is by no means certain, however, that the <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> regime can make permanent structural changes in the federation to reflect the new-found power of the small tribes. The minority elements now in control of the army seem firmly entrenched there. They appear to know what it is they want but are not quite sure of how to go about it. At present, they are working toward a political system that would include a strong central government and at least the present 12 states. Power at the center would be designed mainly to protect the minority tribes from domination by the large tribes, but federal leaders will have to withstand pressures for the creation of more and more states to accommodate Nigeriaʼs many small tribes.</p>
                        <p>The achievement of political stability in Nigeria is no easy task. All the forces contributing to instability–tribalism, regionalism, a plethora of scheming politicians, and endemic financial corruption–remain. Any future civilian government will have to deal with them. as well as with the Ibo problem, which admits of no easy solution. Although many difficulties remain, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his constituency seem determined to develop a workable political entity. Given a reasonable amount of luck, they just might be able to pull it off.</p>

                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ New Proposals on Nigerian Assistance</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has sent you a proposal for a new course of action on Nigerian assistance (Tab B).</p>
                        <p>The Secretaryʼs memorandum notes that the relief effort is running into serious obstacles - the approach of the rainy season; the Nigerian decision to delegate responsibility for relief from the Nigerian Red Cross to the (less efficient) East-Central State government; the (forced) departure of foreign relief and medical personnel; and the aggravation of Nigerian sensitivities by U.S. press and Senatorial criticism. The Secretary concludes that our ability to assist the re-lief program in the next six months will be even more limited than in the past, and warns that “a U.S. image of aggressive preoccupation with short-term relief will be counter-productive and destroy whatever chances we still have of influencing the relief program.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary therefore urges (on p. 3) that our tactics with respect to relief be low-key and indirect -- namely, that we should work with the Federal Government, the East-Central State government, and other groups (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, UNICEF, voluntary agencies) to try to persuade them to accept further U.S. assistance. He also recommends (on p. 4) that we raise our sights from relief to reconstruction, in order to ease our relations with the Nigerians and to contribute to the more promising efforts toward long-term recovery.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that the Secretaryʼs specific tactical recommendations with respect to relief are unexceptionable; indeed, they are the sort of thing the United States should be doing anyway. His recommendation that we devote increasing effort to reconstruction is also useful. But there is no need to subordinate relief to reconstruction, indeed it would be unwise to do so during at least the next-several months. I believe that the obstacles confronting the relief program should be looked upon as dramatizing the seriousness of the current relief needs, and not as a reason for reducing our relief efforts.</p>
                        <p>At Tab A for your approval is a memorandum which I propose to send to the Secretary indicating your approval of his specific operational <pb n="2" xml:id="d195-02" facs="d195-02"/>recommendations but cautioning against a let-up in our relief effort. It also reiterates your view that there is no inherent incompatibility between good relations with the Nigerian Government and a significant continuing U.S. contribution to the relief effort.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
                        <p>That you approve the memorandum from me to the Secretary at Tab A, which approves the Secretaryʼs operational proposals but cautions against a let-up of the relief effort.</p>

                            <item>Nigerian Relief Recommendation:</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>That you approve the course of action described in this memorandum for U.S. policy in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>Approve _______ Disapprove _______</p>
                        <p>Discussion:</p>
                        <p>Three months after the end of the civil war in Nigeria, the relief program has reached a critical transition point. The time has come to define what our own relationship to Nigerian relief should be in the six months to come.</p>
                        <p>For humanitarian reasons and in response to domestic concerns, we have, until now, undertaken to insure that a relief program adequate by our standards is carried out in the former Biafran enclave. (A summary of the current relief efforts is enclosed.) We have undoubtedly played a major role, along with the British, in making possible the minimal relief program which has been carried out; at the same time, by so doing, we have created problems with the Federal Military Government and have reduced our ability to provide and monitor relief.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Present Situation:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the months ahead a number of things are likely to happen which will lessen the effectiveness of the relief program, regardless of what we do. The relief <pb n="4" xml:id="d195-04" facs="d195-04"/>effort will be complicated by the rainy season beginning in May. The Nigerians have made known their intention to shift responsibility for relief in the most critical area from the Nigerian Red Cross to the East-Central State Rehabilitation Commission, with an almost certain loss of efficiency (recent indications are that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> will postpone the date of the shift till the end of June). They are taking this course for internal political reasons as well as because they are convinced the relief requirement is largely concluded.</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians have not yet responded to a UNICEF recommendation that additional food be immediately ordered. Expatriate relief personnel have been leaving. The services of virtually all our Public Health Service doctors have been terminated, and our chances of replacing them are slim. Resistance in the rest of Nigeria to what seems to be preferential treatment for the secessionist area will grow. Nigerian sensitivities will undoubtedly be aggravated by such U.S. domestic events as the request by Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> for a GAO investigation of the relief effort and the recent Washington Star story based on disclosure of a confidential Nigerian nutritional survey.</p>
                        <p>This is not to suggest that, after the phase-out of the Nigerian Red Cross, the relief effort will simply collapse. The Federal authorities apparently have now decided to extend visas for remaining expatriate relief personnel and are considering whether to request additional food imports for relief. While agonizingly slow, there is hope that the Nigerians will face up to the very real continuing needs.</p>
                        <p>Overall, this situation clearly is anything but desirable. Although local food is increasing, the end of the mass feeding problem will not come for at least six months with the fall harvest and the gradual resumption of normal commerce. Our best estimate is that suffering will probably increase in view of the slowness of the Nigerian response but that in the large the problem will be contained and that mass deaths and starvation will be avoided. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that there will be a new spate of unfavorable reports about conditions in eastern Nigeria in the coming months.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d195-05" facs="d195-05"/>
                        <p>What We Can Do:</p>
                        <p>Our ability to improve and contribute to this relief program over the next six months will be even more limited than in the past. The people with whom we maintain influence at the national level and who share our views on nutrition and relief needs will have little role except in institutional relief. A U.S. image of aggressive preoccupation with short-term relief will be counter-productive and destroy whatever chances we still have of influencing the relief program.</p>
                        <p>Our goals for relief must take this into account and our tactics generally must be low-key and indirect:</p>
                        <p>1. We will continue to work with the Federal Ministry of Economic Development and Reconstruction, to the extent that it retains control and influence over future East-Central State relief policies.</p>
                        <p>2. We will attempt to develop a useful role with the East-Central State Government through our AID personnel and possibly through USPHS doctors stationed in the area.</p>
                        <p>3. We will try to convince the East-Central State Government to accept minimal nutritional requirements and to persuade it to order additional shipments of food. We will try to get it to retain as much of the existing apparatus -- expatriate relief teams, transport and logistics system -- as possible. Whatever arrangements are worked out will set the pattern for relief operations in the other war-affected areas.</p>
                        <p>4. In all the above efforts we are attempting to enlist others to play a similar role (e.g., the British, UNICEF, LICROSS and other voluntary agencies).</p>
                        <p>5. We will continue through <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> to monitor the use of our relief material to the extent political realities will permit. We will try to schedule the GAOʼs visit to Nigeria after the Red Cross effort phases out.</p>
                        <p>6. We have made arrangements to divert food to Nigeria in order to keep the pipeline full and hope that the Nigerians will accept shipments when they arrive.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d195-06" facs="d195-06"/>
                        <p>Beyond these limited activities, we should now raise our sights from relief to reconstruction which, by restoring normal life, is the only real long-term solution. Such a development would contribute to our longer range relations with Nigeria, which have suffered considerably in recent years. Given the Nigerian shift in priorities from relief to rehabilitation, we should show our readiness to talk to them about how we can assist in the immediate and urgent task of reconstruction and in longer range development. By participating in reconstruction, which holds more promise than relief, we will be contributing to a return to normal.</p>

                        <p rend="center">APPENDIX<lb/>Status Report: Nigerian Relief</p>
                        <p>About 2.3-3 million people are getting full or partial feeding in the Nigerian Red Cross (NRC) program conducted in the field by teams headed by expatriate doctors and relief workers. The program has distributed 3-4,000 tons of food per week, compared to its target of 4,100 tons a week (although a realistic minimum target based on the nutritional survey of early February in which U.S. Public Health doctors participated, is probably closer to 5,000 tons). The worst shortfall has occurred in the area of most severe need, around Owerri, where deliveries have averaged less than half the 1,600 ton weekly target. The attached chart contains detailed figures on weekly food distribution.</p>
                        <p>Our best estimate, based on the reports of USPHS doctors who have been conducting relief operations, is that the relief effort has been at least minimally adequate. Severe malnutrition has been substantially reduced; hospital and sickbay populations have declined. Medical facilities and care are improving. While progress has been slower than we would wish, the nutritional trend has until recently been upward. Malnutrition and suffering persist but there has been, according to the consensus of the USPHS doctors, no mass starvation or mass death.</p>
                        <p>The mass relief effort to date has operated on a precarious margin. Progress has been achieved, however, by selective feeding. Sickbay and hospital inmates and outpatients have gotten full feeding. With inadequate total supplies, however, the moderately malnourished and the plain hungry have received, in the mass feeding program, less than they need.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The President has reviewed your memorandum to him of May 1, 1970, which proposed a course of action for U.S. policy with respect to Nigerian assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President approves your recommendation that the United States devote increasing attention and effort to rehabilitation and long-term recovery. He also agrees that the six specific operational steps which you outlined with respect to relief should be pursued.</p>
                        <p>However, the President continues to believe that there is no inherent contradiction between good relations with the Nigerian Government and a significant continuing U S. contribution to relief. He believes that the obstacles confronting the relief program at the present time are indicative of the seriousness of current relief needs and should not be taken as a reason for reducing our relief effort.</p>
                        <p>The President therefore directs that vigorous efforts be made to insure that the Government of Nigeria is aware of our perception of the seriousness of the need, of our willingness to be of help, and of the specific types of assistance that we are ready to provide. He wants to be certain that we do everything possible to maintain an undiminished flow of relief supplies to meet critical needs over the next several months.</p>

                        <p>The [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] took part in preparation of Reference B but would like to add a few comments for possible use by ONE. The points made below refer to the breakdown listed in Reference A paper.</p>
                        <p>I.A. Recent reporting indicates that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is going to go much slower than originally thought on demobilisation of the Army. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has indicated he will not consider large scale releases from the Army until the Nigerian Army Rehabilitation Scheme (NARS) is functioning and can absorb some of the veterans. Our current reading of NARS, however, is that it is going very slowly and it will be a long time before a meaningful rehabilitation scheme is operative. There has been little coup talk in recent months and the situation remains basically the same as during the fall of 1969; that is, key units of the Army, particularly the Federal Brigade of Guards and I Div, remain under control of Middle Belt officers completely loyal to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. Gowan is well aware of the problems of the Army in the domestic security field and is trying to build up the Police to take over law and order functions. However, as the time frame now mentioned for return to civilian rule is 18 months to two years, it is quite obvious the Army will be in a dominant position for at least that period.</p>
                        <p>I.B. Reintegration of the Ibos into the national life has gone much better than could have been expected. Large numbers have returned to Lagos and increasingly, Ibos are going back to the North. Civil Service jobs are being opened up to Ibos and the Police effort in absorbing something over 3,000 ex-”Biafran” Police is noteworthy.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d197-02" facs="d197-02"/>
                        <p>II.A. The problem of revenue allocation is going to be crucial. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] it is likely that an outside body will be asked to come up with the formula. However, this issue could cause major problems between the oil producing states and the North particularly.</p>
                        <p>III.A. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] reporting over the past six months has continued to underline the growth of stature and confidence in General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. His state visits within the country have been great personal successes and as he embarks on a round of foreign travel this fall, his inter-national prestige should also grow. His major strength is clearly his incorruptibility and dedication to his job. He lives an almost monastic life and appears to have no great need for recreation or release from his Dodan Barracks duties. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> still, however, is a basically naive and impressionable young man with all of the merits and defects of his military background. He does lose his temper from time to time and sometimes takes a shallow view of events. There is nobody else on the horizon, however, who could really challenge him and his popularity among his senior colleagues as well as the public has grown.</p>
                        <p>III.B. Corruption is of course an absolutely key issue in Nigeria and it is hard to see how it could be erased from the social fabric. However, it is probably too much to say that coruption has been institutionalized on a scale comparable with the pre-coup regime. In our opinion, the present payoffs are much smaller and going to a fewer number of people than previously. Whether or not the present scale of corruption is such that it will have a multiplier effect on the economy, or whether it will cause more disequilibrium remains to be seen. It is too early to judge what factions in the political spectrum have prospects for power, but it now seems doubtful that Awolowo will be among the postwar leaders. It is everyoneʼs assumption there will be an orderly turnover of power to the civilians somewhat in the manner as took place in Ghana.</p>
                        <p>III.C. The key to the Federal structure will be the amount of money which is passed on to the 12 States. Since the war the State structure has become even stronger and Gowan has said that he does not wish to remake State boundaries in the near future. Although there is the usual grumbling among tribes, the lesson of the “Biafran” rebellion was that it didnʼt pay to try to break away. In a negative sense, what holds Nigeria together is the understanding that all sections have to stay together.</p>
                        <p>IV.A. The most noteworthy aspect of postwar Nigeria is its xenophobia. The Nigerians are very cocksure of their strength at present. However, this does not appear to cause them to take a harsh line against their neighbors. The most likely new role for Nigeria will be to take an increasing interest in the anti white redoubt campaign particularly to assist anti-Portuguese refugee groups.</p>
                        <p>IV.B. It is at least arguable that the major Soviet interest in Nigeria is to attempt to make this the key country in their Black Africa policy. The Soviets continue to expand and push their interests vigorously. Their multi-faceted approach includes everything from support to high level politicans to promises of economic assistance. Basically the Soviets have come out of the war in a fair position and they should be able to maintain it.</p>
                        <p>IV.C. The major problem in U.S.-Nigerian relations is the memory of U.S. policy during and just after the war. The Military Government has indicated that future U.S.-Nigerian relations will largely depend upon U.S. provision of military training and military equipment. If the U.S. fails in both of these fields, relations could quickly worsen.</p>
                        <p>IV.D. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has indicated that it plans to make a major effort to return to good relations with France. Nigeria was impressed by <pb n="3" xml:id="d197-03" facs="d197-03"/>the ability of the French to make problems for them and they have decided not to cross the French in the future.</p>
                        <p>IV.E. The British continue to have the major influence in Nigeria and will undoubtedly continue to keep their position in both the economic and the political fields. However, their position is open to attack as the Scott report and the arms to South Africa issues have indicated. Locally the British are working closely with the Nigerians and should be able to maintain their influence in the country. The British will remain, however, a vulnerable target for nationalist and left wing campaigns just because they, are so visible and heavily engaged. The recent growing resentment against the Lebanese business community gives some indication of the kinds of problems the British may face in the future.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> called Monday, August 17 to report on his recent trip to Lagos, where he was summoned back on July 24 for consultations and to attend a conference of senior chiefs of mission. He returned to Washington last Thursday, August 14. In a wide-ranging discussion, a number of subjects were covered as follows:</p>
                        <p>INTERNAL NIGERIA</p>
                        <p>On the home front, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said that things are “really moving.” The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> leadership is earnestly grappling with the major question of how to proceed now for an eventual return to civilian rule. The intention is to move promptly but firmly to establish definite guidelines for an orderly turnover. Some of the problems which have to be resolved before the country is handed back to the civilian politicos are the relative powers within the Federal-state structure, the pattern of the economy, particularly with respect to revenue allocation and public debt, and the Four-Year Development Plan. The latter has been before the Executive Council and this week is to come up for approval by the Supreme Military Council.</p>
                        <p>On the assumption that the plan will be acted upon by the Council before the end of this month, the Ambassador confirmed Mr. Kontosʼ understanding that an economic team led by A.A. Ayida, Permanent <pb n="2" xml:id="d198-02" facs="d198-02"/>Secretary for the Ministry of Economic Development and Reconstruction, will come to Washington the third week in September for deliberations with the World Bank. While here, the team will also meet with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials in connection with the review of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>ʼs future assistance and development policies for Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>U.S.-NIGERIAN RELATIONS</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Improved Feeling Toward United States</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> found among top Government officials and advisers a positive and marked upswing of a cordial attitude toward the United States. The proposed <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> reconstruction loan has been enthusiastically received with the expectation of considerably simplified procedures particularly appreciated. The Ambassador claimed that even officials who had been cool toward the United States were characterizing the loan and its procedures as a realistic and positive step in response to Nigerian requirements. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> therefore hoped the implementation would not bog down and conclusion of the loan negotiations would be rapid. The Ambassador remarked that there was a noticeable appreciation in many Government quarters over the “falling off” of a U.S. tendency to insist on winning every point in talks and negotiations with Nigerian officials. In general the United States Embassy in Lagos was handling well its relationships with the Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Activities of Relief Foundations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A discordant note in relations with the United States according to the Ambassador is the strong feeling in Lagos that the authorities in Washington are not doing as much as they could regarding the residual activities in the United States of pro-Biafran elements. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> thinks that laws could have been enforced more stringently to stop the fund-raising efforts of organizations such as the Biafran International Foundation and the Nigerian War Victims Relief Foundation. In Nigerian eyes, the money is being raised for the personal gain of individuals who are committing fraud in claiming contributions are for relief purposes and tax exempt.</p>
                        <p>On this subject, Mr. Kontos responded by emphasizing that the U.S. Government is mindful of the necessity to review the activities of these organizations. He pointed out that the Internal Revenue Service at the instigation of the Department is currently reviewing the bona fides of both organizations. A report on this review is expected shortly from the IRS.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d198-03" facs="d198-03"/>
                        <p>TENTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS</p>
                        <p>In reply to an inquiry by Mr. Kontos, the Ambassador told of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs present plans for the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of Nigeriaʼs independence. All African heads of state are to be invited except those from the four countries -- Ivory Coast, Gabon, Tanzania, and Zambia -- with whom the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> does not have relations. No decision has yet been taken on representation from non-African countries. If invitations are extended, it will be at a level lower than head of state. However, it may be decided to have states outside of Africa simply represented by their Ambassadors in Lagos. Plans for the celebrations are expected to become final by the end of this week and he would let us know the decision right away. If high-ranking delegations from non-African states are not to be a part of the anniversary format, the Ambassador said he had pro-posed specifically for the United States that some time after the October 1 celebrations five or six distinguished U.S. personalities who are special friends of Nigeria be invited to visit in a group as guests of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. They would be given the opportunity to meet with top officials and to make an extensive tour of Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>U.S. VISITORS TO NIGERIA</p>
                        <p>According to the Ambassador, he made special arrangements to have General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> receive Carl Rowan during the latterʼs visit in Lagos August 16-19. Appointments for meetings with a number of other high officials and with business and university people have also been set up for him. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> indicated that the visit to Nigeria by Governor Brimmer of the Federal Reserve had gone very well and that he had made a favorable impression on all who saw him including General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. The visits of the various study groups have also been profitable and have not caused problems. The Ambassador was pleased that there had been so many Black Americans included in the groups.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion on visitors, Mr. Kontos took the occasion to bring up the problem of the prolonged delay in obtaining Nigerian visas for two contract personnel involved in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-financed projects whose applications have been pending since last May. Although the Department has had indirect word from Lagos that the Nigerian immigration service had cabled the Embassy here authorizing the issuance of these visas, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> denied this was true. He agreed however to look into the case and let Mr. Kontos know the status of the applications in the near future.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d198-04" facs="d198-04"/>
                        <p>DECREE TO RETIRE BIAFRAN SUPPORTERS</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> explained that the decree had been promulgated to enable the Federal and State Governments to retire with pension benefits a very small number of former public employees who were unqualified or whose places had been filled during the war and for whom alternative employment in Government service cannot be found. The decree would also be applied to an even smaller group known to have been actively identified with the planning and execution of the rebellion whom it would not be possible to employ in Government positions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> assured that the decree would in no way affect the thousands already reinstated in their jobs with the Federal and State Governments and that no intention prevails to dismiss all Government employees who happened to be on the rebel side during the war.</p>
                        <p>TREATMENT OF DIPLOMATS AT DULLES AIRPORT</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> concluded his call by complaining about the treatment he had received at Dulles Airport. Upon arrival on two occasions, his staff was not permitted to enter the restricted area to help him with immigration and customs formalities, he had to wait in line along with the other passengers, he was unable to get porter service to assist with his luggage, and in general the authorities would not accord the preferential treatment which the Ambassador thought his status deserved. The Ambassador plans to inform his Government of the difficulties he has had at Dulles, but before filing his report hopes to be able to indicate the steps which will be taken by the Department to remedy the situation. Mr. Kontos promised to raise the question immediately with the Deputy Chief of Protocol and hoped to have an answer for the Ambassador in a few days.</p>

                        <p>2. International relief ($40 million from us, $45 million from everybody else) has succeeded in averting mass starvation.</p>
                        <p>3. Our relief help continues for the time being, but Nigerian dependence on outside help is diminishing rapidly.</p>
                        <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has followed a generous policy of reconciliation with the Ibos.</p>
                        <p>5. The future economic prospects for Nigeria are promising.</p>
                        <p>6. Our relations with Nigeria have pretty much recovered, although there is still lingering resentment over our role during the civil war.</p>

                            <item>Nigeria Seven Months After the War The Crisis Receding</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Seven months have gone by since the end of the Nigerian civil war. It has been a period of considerable recovery and return to peaceful pursuits. The war-affected areas are becoming economically more productive as the postwar reconstruction effort takes effect. The relief provided since the war (approximately $40 million from the United States and $45 million estimated from other nations) has headed off starvation. In the last three months the mass feeding program has ended; food is still being provided to those of greatest need in sickbays and hospitals. We continue to support the relief program with food shipments, but we expect that Nigerian dependence on outside help for feeding will diminish rapidly.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has been able to maintain a policy of generous reconciliation toward the Ibos. Reintegration at the federal level is underway, particularly in the police force, the postal and telegraph services, and the federal army, which has absorbed 1,500 prodigal enlisted men despite the problem of demobilizing a wartime force of over 200,000. Strains remain; states contiguous to the former enclave have been loathe to permit the once dominant Ibosʼ return. In other areas of the country, however, Ibos are slowly regaining their former positions; property and rents held in escrow during the war are being handed back to Ibo owners.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Although Nigeria came out of the war with its basic potential for long run economic growth intact, there were inevitable internal strains: heavy domestic borrowing, <pb n="3" xml:id="d199-03" facs="d199-03"/>delayed foreign exchange, remissions, inflation, and large-scale unemployment. Some food products doubled in price towards the end of the war and rents since then have increased. Smuggling of export crops in exchange for banned luxury goods has been widespread.</p>
                        <p>Central and state governments plan increased outlays for social services. Their budgets reflect the end of war-time expenditures and the expectation of increased revenue from oil (estimated at $280 million this year). Nigeria is now the worldʼs tenth largest producer and seventh largest exporter of oil. Production reached 1 million barrels a day in April, is expected to average 1.3 million in 1971, and could exceed 4 million before 1980. Nigeria remains the worldʼs largest exporter of peanuts, the second largest exporter of cocoa, and a significant exporter of palm produce, rubber, timber products, and tin. Its economy--bolstered by the burgeoning petroleum industry -- could become the fastest growing and most powerful in Black Africa.</p>
                        <p>In the war-affected area in the east, economic activity is also resuming, although at a slower pace. Government services have resumed. Local industries and banks are re-opening. The outlook for the fall harvest seems promising. Government agricultural marketing boards and local traders are back in business. These activities, plus the Federal Governmentʼs payments of $56.00 to every depositor of Biafran currency, are gradually easing the economy of the eastern states away from barter and back to a market economy. The Federal Government has announced a plan to spend $28 million on a program in the East-Central State for reconstruction of war damage and to further the stateʼs economic recovery.</p>

                        <p>Our relations with Nigeria are more cordial now than during and just after the war. Although there is lingering resentment over our neutrality during the secession and our aggressive role in dealing with the relief problem, the legacy of the past is diminishing as our ties with Nigeriaʼs new leadership are enhanced. In addition to our ongoing <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program, we have begun negotiations on a $15 million reconstruction loan which will underline our support during the, present transitional period. We hope that Congressional action will permit us to respond to a Nigerian request for military training and mount a modest military assistance program. The Nigerians place great importance on this prospect.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">CONCLUSIONS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. The Nigerian Civil War ended with surprisingly little rancor. The defeated Ibos are accepted as fellow citizens in many parts of Nigeria, but not in some areas of former Biafra where they were once dominant. Iboland is an overpopulated, economically depressed area, where massive unemployment is likely to prevail for some years.</p>
                        <p>B. Nigeria is still very much a tribal society, in which clan, tribal and regional jealousies, hostilities and interests count for more than national attachment. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, Head of the Federal Military Government (<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>), is the accepted national leader and his popularity has grown since the end of the war. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is neither very efficient nor dynamic, but the recent announcement that it intends to retain power for six more years has generated little opposition so far. The Nigerian Army, vastly expanded during the war, is both the main support of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, and the chief threat to it. The troops are poorly trained and disciplined and some of the officers are turning to conspiracies and plotting. We think <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> will have great difficulty in staying in office through the period which he has said is necessary before the turnover of power to civilians. His sudden removal would dim the prospects for Nigerian stability.</p>
                        <p>C. Nigeriaʼs economy came through the war in better shape than expected. But there is considerable inflation, a heavy internal debt, and a huge military budget. Popular demands for schools, clinics, and other services are growing, and will place new burdens on the budget. The petroleum industry is expanding faster than expected, and oil revenues will help defray military and social service expenditures. Economic development as envisaged in the 1970-1974 plan will depend heavily on external loans and grants.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d201-05" facs="d201-05"/>
                        <p>D. Nigeria emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national pride mixed with antiforeign sentiment, and an intention to play a larger role in African and world affairs. British influence is still strong in cultural and economic matters, but in the political sphere it is declining and likely to do so further. The Soviet Union benefits from Nigerian appreciation of its wartime military support, but is not making a major effort to exert influence. Nigerian relations with the US, although cool at the end of the war, are improving. Many in the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> appear to see France as the key to future Nigerian efforts to develop closer economic ties with francophone neighbors, and thus important to the expansion of Nigerian influence.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">DISCUSSION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">I. INTRODUCTION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Nigeriaʼs fundamental problem has been its inability to devise a political arrangement which would provide both national unity and safeguards for the separate interests of its more than 250 tribal groups. In colonial days the British lumped these peoples together for administrative convenience and called the area Nigeria. At independence, tribal allegiances were still far stronger than national feelings. Under the original federal system each of the major tribes (Ibo, Yoruba, and Hausa-Fulani) dominated a region which embraced its own homeland as well as those of lesser tribes. The central government featured a parliament in which the conservative Northern Moslems held the deciding vote. This arrangement was devised by the British as a means of inducing the reluctant northerners to accept the federation. Southern Nigerians, more modern and generally Christian or animist, found themselves either junior partners in the federation or in opposition. The system soon ran into serious trouble when the major tribes were unable to agree even on census results or to conduct fair parliamentary elections.</p>
                        <p>2. The military coups of 1966 put an end to the first Nigerian federation but in the process exacerbated tribal and regional antagonisms. Massacres of Ibos from the Eastern Region who were living in the North and mounting Ibo fears of domination by Northerners led to the secession of the East to form the Republic of Biafra. The Federal Military Government (FMG), based in Lagos and headed by Major-General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, took up arms against Biafra in the cause of “one Nigeria”. The war dragged on for two and a half years until the superiority of Federal weapons and manpower wore down the stubborn Biafran defense effort.</p>
                        <p>3. The immediate effect of the Federal victory in the Civil War has been to discredit the concept of secession. It has provided an opportunity for those who are seeking a more durable framework of Nigerian institutions. It will be a long time before Nigeria becomes a homogeneous nation. The question now is <pb n="6" xml:id="d201-06" facs="d201-06"/>whether or not the diverse peoples of Nigeria can take advantage of this respite to move toward mutual accommodations. Tribal animosities have not been eradicated by the war, but in the aftermath there have been few issues contentious enough to test the cohesion of the Nigerian polity. Nigeria, if it holds together, has probably the best prospects for development of any black African state. In terms of population it is by far the largest. It has the potential to become the spokesman for black African interests in world assemblages. But it must be kept in mind that many Nigerian institutions are weak or untested, and divisive currents are strong. We cannot make precise calculations of Nigeriaʼs chances of success or failure in meeting the many problems before it. This Estimate is, therefore, more concerned with laying out those problems than it is with predictions.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">II. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CIVIL WAR</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. The sudden end to the fighting in January 1970 presented the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> with an array of new problems in addition to those left unresolved by the war. Relief for the defeated Ibos and their allies in the East was required immediately. Beyond that was the question of how to reintegrate the rebels into Nigerian society. There was also the question of what to do with the Federal Army, swollen during the war to perhaps 250,000 men. And always in the background, was the sticky issue of devising institutions which would ensure some measure of national unity and provide protection to the various mutually-suspicious tribes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">A. The Ibo Problem</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Though the Civil War was fought with considerable bitterness and prolonged by Ibo fears of genocide, it ended with surprisingly little rancor. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs policy of reconciliation has set the tone for relations between victor and vanquished. The mass of the Ibos and others who supported the Biafran cause are officially considered as “misled”. The top ranks of Biafran leaders, the “misleaders” as they are now called, are mostly in exile and a few are in detention. Gowon has no intention of staging war crimes trials. Others in the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and in the army would prefer a harsher policy than he has followed so far. To some extent <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs options are limited by these hard-liners. Were he to show special favor to ex-Biafrans, he would encounter stiff opposition from many of his colleagues. Yet, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has assumed the obligation of feeding the Biafran populace and coordinating the medical relief effort. The early shortcomings of the program seem to have been attributable more to inefficiency than to vindictiveness. Gradual improvements in the relief effort have dramatically lessened malnutrition and associated diseases in former Biafran territory.</p>
                        <p>6. The sudden military collapse of Biafra left an economic and political vacuum, with the inhabitants of the area in a state of shock and exhaustion and bereft of trusted leadership. Since then, an Ibo political administration, formed during the war by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> for the purpose of governing reconquered portions of Iboland, has expanded to become the government of the East-Central State. It furnishes <pb n="7" xml:id="d201-07" facs="d201-07"/>employment to some 30,000 Ibo civil servants, but this is only a part of the hordes of Ibos who had formerly served in the Federal and Eastern Regional Governments. The lack of employment of these Ibos as well as millions of others who before the war had filled a variety of skilled and unskilled jobs both in Iboland and throughout Nigeria constitutes a massive problem. Even before the war, Iboland was one of the most densely populated areas of black Africa. It has few resources and its poor soil was overworked during the war. In prewar days, remittances from Ibos in other parts of Nigeria helped sustain the community at home. This source of income is now virtually gone, and, even if the prewar industries and commercial enterprises of Iboland are rapidly restored, unemployment will be the major problem in that overcrowded rural ghetto for many years.</p>
                        <p>7. The only hope for many Ibos is to migrate, although this is what brought the trouble before. Small numbers of Ibos have already begun to move out of their tribal homeland, and, where they have found jobs in the North or West, they are accepted as fellow citizens. Almost all former Ibo policemen have been absorbed into the Nigerian Police, and some former soldiers are being accepted in the Federal Army. The integration of Ibo officers poses a more touchy problem. The main obstacle to the Ibos is the fact that there simply are not many job opportunities for them elsewhere in Nigeria. The jobs left by the Ibo exodus on the eve of the war have been filled by Yorubas or other Nigerians. Moreover, few Ibo businessmen have the capital to open new enterprises or resume old ones. In some areas, especially Port Harcourt and other minority tribal lands of the East and Mid-West, where Ibos had once dominated economic life, they are not welcome nor are they likely to be for some years.</p>
                        <p>8. While the plight of the Ibos is unlikely to be eased for a long time, there is little chance of another attempt at secession. Few Ibos want to go through that again. They will certainly be frustrated, and perhaps resentful at the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, but there is little that they can do about it. There will probably be some increase in lawlessness and disorder in Iboland, and large numbers will head for the cities in the West even if no jobs are available there. By so doing they will merely add to the problem of urban unemployment in southern Nigeria, which was a troublesome enough issue before the war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">B. The Federal Army</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. The Nigerian Federal Army, which on the eve of the war numbered about 8,000, has grown to a force of perhaps 250,000 and may still be increasing. Its very size poses major problems for the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his advisors have decided against an early demobilization, fearing that the release of thousands without employable skills and accustomed to violence might have an unsettling effect upon a none too stable society. There is already a fairly high incidence of crime and violence—often committed by men in uniform—in all parts of Nigeria. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is concerned about this and is trying to retrieve firearms now in the hands of soldiers and ex-soldiers. Nigerian police (about 30,000 men) are fairly efficient but are too widely dispersed to stamp out the current crime <pb n="8" xml:id="d201-08" facs="d201-08"/>wave and are reluctant to arrest men in army uniform. Under these conditions, it is unlikely that there will be more than token reductions in the strength of the Nigerian Army over the next couple of years.</p>
                        <p>10. The army is far larger than necessary to provide defense against external aggression, maintain the unity of the federal system, and assist in the preservation of internal security. Keeping this huge force usefully employed and out of the way of civilians and police is a problem. Some training programs have been established, emphasizing retraining of NCOʼs and junior grade officers, and basic military drills. A crash program of barracks construction is also underway in various parts of Nigeria, where the military will be permanently stationed. Eventually a sizeable portion of the army will probably be enrolled in educational or training projects and some may be assigned to civic action programs. Their plans are still under consideration, however, and for a large part of the army there is still much idleness and time for mischief.</p>
                        <p>11. There are clear advantages as well as obvious dangers to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> in maintaining such a large army. Merely by its size and presence, the army is now, and may continue to be, a force for national cohesion. Discontented tribal groups, labor unions, or others are less likely to defy authority, so long as the government has a considerable armed force at its disposal. This is true only to the extent that the army maintains cohesion and discipline, and there are some circumstances that favor such stability. Most officers and men receive higher pay than they could hope to earn in civilian jobs. Most have at least a rudiinentary national consciousness, having fought for “One Nigeria”, and many officers are personally loyal to <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. Moreover, army units are tribally mixed and few officers would be able quickly to assemble and utilize for coup purposes a large contingent of fellow tribesmen.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d201-09" facs="d201-09"/>
                        <p>12. On the other hand, it can be argued that the army constitutes a major potential threat to security in Nigeria. It remains an ill-trained and ill-disciplined outfit, composed of large units led by junior officers who are also poorly trained. Within the officer corps there is some ill-feeling between the “dirties” (those who have enriched themselves during military rule) and the “cleans” (those who have not). Some officers, as well as some in the ranks, are bored by barracks life, and are seeking diversion, either by stirring up trouble in areas near the barracks or by discussing among themselves the political and military problems of Nigeria. Under the circumstances, we would expect a considerable amount of low-level turbulence involving soldiers and civilians, some intermittent factional feuding among officers, and a growing political awareness in the army. None of this would pose much of a threat to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, or to the cohesion of Nigeria. The dangers are that local squabbles can easily become riots, which might be difficult to put down, and that political discussions tend to be dominated by tribal interests, suspicions of corruption, and ties between officers and civilian politicians. There are already reports of plotting by junior officers against the regime. Heretofore these have come to naught, but the atmosphere is increasingly conducive to plots and conspiracies.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and his advisors are well aware of the potential threat to themselves from an idle or discontented army. Indeed, Gowon has been more concerned with army affairs than with internal political problems, economic development, or foreign relations. His plans for the army, though still only very general, appear to be centered around the provision of vast amounts of new equipment and training. Before this ambitious program can get underway, how-ever, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> will face serious challenges. Given the situation he confronts—centrifugal forces at work in the Nigerian Army, the divisive effect of corruption in the military, uncertain loyalties and allegiances, conflicting ambitions of key individuals, and the gradually rising pressures from civilian tribal and regional factions—we think Gowon will have great difficulty in staying in office over the six year period which he has said is necessary for the turnover of power to civilians. Much will depend on Gowonʼs success in bringing Nigeria together.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">III. PROSPECTS FOR INTERNAL COHESION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. By and large the basic decisions on the future of Nigeria have not yet been faced by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. The 12-state scheme, conceived by <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> shortly before the war as a substitute for the old semiautonomous regions, seems likely to last for some time, though perhaps with modifications. It has reduced the potential political power of the large tribes, advanced the interests of the minority tribes in the North and East, and provided a balance between North and South.</p>
                        <p>15. Individual states differ enormously in size, tribal unity, and efficiency. The Western and Mid-Western states are more or less the successors of the old regional arrangement, while some of the northern states are barely off the ground in terms of providing services and establishing bureaucracies. In some states bitter tribal and clan rivalries raise doubts about the permanence of the arrangement. Few of the states are reasonable administrative units; many lack competent civil servants of local origin and are handicapped by inept military or police governors. But, despite these deficiencies, for many of the lesser tribes, there is considerable satisfaction in sharing in a state government. Politically, the states are much weaker vis-a-vis the central government than were the old regions. One of the major issues between state and federal governments will revolve around the allocation of revenues to the states. A temporary formula for the allocation of the oil revenues was accepted early this year. When the matter comes up again, the non-oil producing states, particularly those in the North, will demand a larger share. If they do not get what they feel they are entitled to, there is likely to be trouble of some sort.</p>
                        <p>16. The particular problems of the backward northern states are likely to loom larger in the next few years. The political apparatus of the conservative northern aristocracy, which had ruled Nigeria before the military coups, is in disarray but is not beyond repair. If this aristocracy is able to regain its former cohesion and revive its political vehicle, it could disrupt the new and fragile state system in the North. This would be difficult because minority tribes in the <pb n="10" xml:id="d201-10" facs="d201-10"/>North enjoy running their own affairs and would resist any shift in favor of the large tribes. Hence, the chances are against an early resurrection of conservative northern political power. But, in any event, Northern pressures on Lagos for funds for education and development will be very strong and will present the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> with some thorny problems of allocation.</p>
                        <p>17. The central government is probably the most fragile part of the Nigerian system, because it depends largely on one man, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> possesses many of the qualities needed to lead Nigeriaʼs multitribal society. He is from a small tribe in the North. He has survived four years in office without taint of personal corruption, and with a reputation for patience, fairness and moderation. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> is widely esteemed as the architect of victory, and as he becomes better known to Nigerians he is acquiring a personal popularity. He is, however, not very dynamic and often tends to look for a consensus among his colleagues rather than make hard decisions himself. Since the warʼs end, <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> have provided Nigeria with very little sense of movement. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs recent anniversary speech identified national goals, but many of his listeners were discouraged by the prospect of six more years of military rule.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs position is not threatened at the moment, though there are discontented factions within the army, and impatient politicians are hankering for a return to civilian rule. Eventually he will have to make some unpopular decisions, e.g., on the disposition of ex-Biafran “misleaders”, on specific constitutional plans, and on allocation of federal funds. Opposition to Gowon is likely to take shape on one or another of these issues, and there is likely to be more plotting and eventually a challenge to his position. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs sudden removal would dim prospects for Nigerian stability. While there is a remote possibility that an unknown might appear who could take control, none of the present high ranking military figures in Nigeria appear likely to be able to command the respect and allegiance of the important elements in the country. The federal civil service could keep the machinery of government running in some fashion even without effective leadership, but a dispute among contestants for control of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> could quickly arouse tribal hostilities and again endanger the cohesion of the Nigerian state.</p>
                        <p>19. As time goes on, would-be political leaders among the civilians are certain to press harder for an early return to civilian control. Despite the current ban on overt political activity, shadow organizations based on the old parties are stirring, and new cliques are forming. For the most part these groups are still too amorphous to permit an estimate of their chances of coming to power. Their chances will remain poor so long as the army remains cohesive and in agreement on support for the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">IV. ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. Nigeria is basically a poor country. In terms of per capita income and living standards it is not much better off than its neighbors. Like many other African states, it suffers from a debilitating climate, tropical diseases, a cultural <pb n="11" xml:id="d201-11" facs="d201-11"/>tolerance of corruption, a severe shortage of skills and managerial expertise and a low level of technological development. Though Nigeria has a relatively large educated elite, their training has not always been in fields most useful to national development. A sizeable proportion of this elite are Ibos, who are not likely to find suitable employment in the national economy any time soon.</p>
                        <p>21. Nigeria does, however, possess some assets which give it considerable economic potential. Its substantial petroleum reserves are nearer to the major West European market than Persian Gulf oil and are of low sulphur content, a highly desired quality in a time of concern over pollution. Moreover, Nigeria is capable of supplying its own basic food requirements and exports in large quantities a variety of agricultural products: mainly peanuts, peanut oil, cocoa, rubber, cotton, and palm products. The very size of the population, perhaps 55 million, could eventually lead to the development of a market that would encourage investment.</p>
                        <p>22. The Nigerian economy came through the war better than might have been expected. Nonetheless, the strains of financing the war increased the internal debt enormously, depleted foreign exchange reserves, and created an inflation of consumer prices (over 10 percent per year in urban areas). There was extensive damage to roads, bridges, power plants, and industries in the war zone, as well as general deterioration of infrastructure elsewhere. Also at the warʼs end the military budget, which had amounted to about $35 million in FY 1967, had burgeoned to over $500 million in FY 1970.</p>
                        <p>23. The legacy of the war is likely to weigh heavily on the economy for some time to come. A good fall harvest and relaxation of the import quotas would reduce the rate of inflation, but the war damage will not be repaired for another year or two at least. Moreover shortage of foreign exchange is likely to persist for several years, and this is likely to have a depressing effect, particularly in the private sector.</p>
                        <p>24. More important are the demands which the military establishment and the state governments will almost certainly make of the central treasury. The military plans, as nearly as they can be determined, call for more personnel, construction of new installations, and purchases of a good deal of expensive new equipment. Hence, there is little likelihood that the military budget will drop much in the next few years. As for the states, many are just beginning to build bureaucracies and respond to popular demands for amenities. The demand for more education, in particular, is universal and strong, even in the North, which is generally poorer and behind the South in all forms of modernization and development. All states will depend upon allocations of federal funds to meet their budgets, and many will have sizeable deficits.</p>
                        <p>25. Fortunately for the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, the petroleum industry is expanding at a faster rate than expected. Oilʼs chief contribution to the Nigerian economy lies in the rents, royalties, and profits taxes paid to the government. They will total about $280 million this year (about a third of current revenue) and are expected to <pb n="12" xml:id="d201-12" facs="d201-12"/>double by 1973. But Nigeria is not another Libya; it has over 50 million people, and oil revenues, while very important, will not provide a financial panacea.</p>
                        <p>26. The current annual budget will be in deficit, even if projected new capital expenditures get off to a very slow start. And for the next few years, at least, we expect recurrent government expenditures, particularly on the military establishment, on reconstruction, and on social services, to absorb all or practically all the additional revenues from oil. Economic development, as envisaged in the 1970-1974 plan would require extensive external financing, and more internal borrowing which would add to inflationary pressures. Full implementation of this plan will cost about $4.5 billion. We doubt that Nigeria has the capacity to absorb this amount of investment. There is already some movement on the part of foreign lenders: the World Bank plans to furnish some $31 million in 1970 and additional funds in future years; the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the US, Canada, West Germany, Japan, and the USSR are likely to provide some grants or loans. Nigeria can also draw on the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Over the longer run, oil revenues could contribute to development projects, especially if more revenue becomes available through an increase in the rate of royalties. Government priorities, however, would determine how much actually went into development.</p>
                        <p>27. Oil revenues will be so important in terms of satisfying military and social service demands, that relations between the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and the foreign oil companies will be a key consideration over the next few years. The British control well over two-thirds of the productive capacity, and US companies are second with investments of some $500 million and larger commitments planned. Government relations with the companies generally follow the pattern established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), although Nigeria does not belong to OPEC. Any terms that oil companies agree to in other countries, particularly Libya and Algeria, are likely to be applied by Nigeria. Thus, Nigeria may earn far more from oil than is currently projected, and be able to finance more of the development plan from internal sources. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would like to set up a national oil producing company, but lacks qualified personnel, and will probably settle for a joint enterprise while still granting production rights on other sites to foreign firms. There is no evidence thus far of Nigerian intentions to nationalize foreign oil production interests, nor would they be likely to do so in the next few years unless a wave of nationalizations were to sweep over other oil producing countries.</p>
                        <p>28. Foreign investment in the oil industry is thus likely to rise over the next few years. Other investors, however, are often put off by the complexities of Nigerian Government regulations and the rudeness and corruption of many officials. Most foreign dealings with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> involve costly delays and many are colored by Nigerian distrust of foreigners. Over the next few years, at least, many would-be private foreign investors are likely to be inhibited by the high levels of taxation, restrictions on imports and capital repatriation, and by the rising pressure for greater Nigerianization of company personnel. Moreover, most of the attractive openings for import substitution were filled in the 1960s. Nigeria <pb n="13" xml:id="d201-13" facs="d201-13"/>already produces enough of a few classes of goods to meet local demand, but future investors will find some opportunities to manufacture consumer goods. Such sophisticated products as petrochemicals and fertilizer are likely to require a larger market than Nigeria can offer for some time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">V. NIGERIA AND THE WORLD</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>29. During and after the Civil War, Nigerians have been developing a sense of national and racial pride, a heightened sensitivity to slights by foreigners, and an awareness of their own status as Africaʼs most populous nation. Heretofore Nigeria has played a modest role in African affairs, even less on the world scene. There is still no indication that Nigeria is about to take bold new initiatives in foreign policy, but there is a more sharply nationalistic and xenophobic tone to Nigerian pronouncements, less pro-Western and more pro-African. As a consequence, Nigeria can be expected to try to minimize foreign influences in Nigeria itself.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">A. The United Kingdom</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>30. Nigerians have developed a kind of love-hate relationship with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. It is an ambivalence common to many former colonies in their dealings with the ex-metropole, but reinforced in the case of Nigeria by the experiences of the war. Official British policy was to furnish the Federal armed forces with ample supplies of small arms, but no aircraft or sophisticated weapons. But, throughout the war, British public opinion leaned strongly toward the Biafrans. Consequently, many Nigerians viewed the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as a half-hearted supporter of their effort to preserve national unity. By and large, British influence in cultural, economic, and even political matters is still greater than that of any other power. Britain is the single most important Nigerian trading partner, and the British stake in Nigerian petroleum, commercial, transport and other enterprises is sizeable.</p>
                        <p>31. Difficulties are likely to arise between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Nigeria on a number of issues. To the extent that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> presses ahead with Nigerianization of jobs, contracts, licenses, and shareholding, British commercial interests, which are the most conspicuous of foreign holdings, will suffer most. Lagosʼ reaction to the recent <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> suggestion of a more liberal arms policy toward South Africa was pretty mild. Other African responses were much sharper, and many in Nigeria demanded that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> take a harder line. Should the British go ahead with the arms deal, or reopen talks with Rhodesia, Nigeria will probably be much more vociferous and will seek some means of manifesting its displeasure, i.e., by demonstrations against the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence in Nigeria, or by joining other Africans in withdrawing from the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">B. France and Francophone Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>32. The <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> has far more reason to be irritated with the French than with the British. French funds and equipment helped Biafra prolong its resistance for <pb n="14" xml:id="d201-14" facs="d201-14"/>many months, and two French client states, Gabon and the Ivory Coast, actually extended recognition to Biafra. Yet the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> finds it convenient to overlook these activities, and would like to improve relations with Paris. Pragmatism is the dominant note in these relations. All of Nigeriaʼs near neighbors as well as most of those beyond these are ex-French colonies, in which French influences predominate. Most of these states depend upon French aid and their foreign policies are formulated with close attention to the aims of the French Government or even in conjunction with resident French advisors. Moreover, France still has troops in some of these states, and has defense agreements with most of them. Nigerians, like most black Africans, have both respect for French power and uneasiness over French intentions.</p>
                        <p>33. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> has been attempting to improve bilateral relations with his francophone neighbors. He is learning the French language and has met recently with the Presidents of all neighboring states. In the past official relations between Nigeria and the francophone states have not been close, but in many cases Nigerian tribal lands spread over political boundaries. Yorubas live in Dahomey as well as in western Nigeria; and Hausa-Fulani peoples in northern Nigeria and in Niger share linguistic and cultural interests. To the extent that Nigeria is not diverted by internal disruptions, it is likely to be in closer contact with its neighbors and by its size and power, will exert some influence over them. Some issues such as smuggling along the Nigeria-Dahomey frontier, and the confusion over boundary lines between Cameroon and Nigeria will probably be handled without reference to France. Any plans Nigeria might formulate for wider regional economic cooperation with its neighbors—a concept which Nigerians find attractive—would depend largely on the approval of the French.</p>

                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>34. The unwillingness of the Western Powers to furnish aircraft and other major military items to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> at the beginning of the Civil War left this field open to the Soviets. With considerable publicity, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proclaimed itself the true friend of Nigeria, and sold to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> a variety of hardware including Mig-17 planes. Although Soviet assistance was limited to sales of equipment and provision of technical assistance, all paid for in hard currency, the Soviets have been able to trade on Nigerian gratitude to enlarge their diplomatic and commercial missions in Lagos, and to expand contacts with Nigerian leftists. With the war over, the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> is much less dependent upon Soviet arms, but the Soviets are still well-regarded in Nigeria. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and other top military figures do not trust the Soviets, but are appreciative of Soviet assistance during the war.</p>
                        <p>35. The Soviets seem interested in maintaining their prestigious role in Nigeria so long as it does not cost much. There are about 280 Soviets in Nigeria now. A small Soviet military mission assists in the maintenance of aircraft, and about a dozen Nigerians are receiving military training in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviets have given the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> the impression that they are eager to aid in Nigerian reconstruction <pb n="15" xml:id="d201-15" facs="d201-15"/>but have stalled on economic commitments. They clearly are hesitant to plunge into such dubious ventures as an iron and steel plant, but are pushing hard for Nigerian acceptance of more Soviet arms and training in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They would like to become sole suppliers of military aid to Nigeria, and have persuaded some officials in the Nigerian Defense Ministry and some army officers of the wisdom of such a scheme. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> and the top leadership in the armed forces are cool to the idea. They have had some problems with Soviet equipment, do not relish the prospect of more Soviet military advisors, and do not wish to become too dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> seems determined, however, to provide the military with large amounts of materiel and training, and, if these needs cannot be met through traditional Western sources, he might reluctantly turn to communist sources.</p>
                        <p>36. Obviously, the Soviets enjoy their acceptance as a friend of black Africaʼs largest state, but they have not launched a major effort to exploit their position in Nigeria. The Soviets continue to fund leftist politicians, labor officials, and university leaders, as well as a number of front organizations. These clients are generally inept opportunists with little or no following or influence. The Soviet-Nigerian cultural societies seem unpromising as vehicles for expanding Soviet influence under present conditions. So long as <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, or someone with similar views, is in power there is little likelihood of a major increase in Soviet influence.</p>
                        <p>37. If conditions in Nigeria were to change radically, i.e., if <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> were replaced by a military or civilian figure willing to accept a larger Soviet presence, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably be in a better position to expand its influence. But even in these circumstances, the Soviets would realize that Nigeriaʼs petroleum wealth and close economic ties with the West limit the political leverage they could expect from a major aid effort. Furthermore, we think that the Soviets would be leery of overly close identification with a particular Nigerian leader or regime. The Soviets have responded cautiously to black African overtures, at least since the downfall of Russian-backed rulers in Ghana and Mali. So far as we can determine, West Africa does not rank very high in the Soviet scale of priorities.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>38. The US decision early in the Civil War to sell arms to neither side was regarded by Lagos as an indication of US lack of sympathy with the Federal effort to preserve the integrity of Nigeria. Subsequent US actions to alleviate starvation in Biafra seemed to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> a further confirmation of their suspicions that the US was not on their side. Relations became very cool during and immediately after the war, but have since shown signs of improvement. Even <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, who was more inclined to see the US in a favorable light than most in the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, seemed to believe that the US was not really much interested in Nigeria, except for the petroleum. He and others in the top military ranks would prefer to get arms and training from the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> rather than to rely upon the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They have taken the recent US affirmative response to their military training requests as an indication of US support for and interest in Nigeria.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="d201-16" facs="d201-16"/>
                        <p>39. The major US material interest in Nigeria is the large and growing private investment in the oil fields. The <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> maintains a monitoring station in Kaduna, and there are some 4,000 US private citizens, many of them missionaries and businessmen, living in Nigeria. In a broader sense, the state of US relations with Nigeria is important simply because Nigeria is so much more populous than any other black African state and because its prospects are somewhat better than most of the others, if it holds together. Nigerian officials are proud, hypersensitive, and prickly. Diplomatic and other dealings with them will present challenges, and Nigerians will be slow to accept the US as a friend, even if Washington is fairly forthcoming in matters of economic and military assistance.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>40. Nigeriaʼs size, geographic position, and relative development should favor an important leadership role for it among black African nations. There has been a surge of self-confidence and heightened nationalism in postwar Nigeria, and there is some evidence of more ambitious aims with respect to relations with other African states. Nigeria is likely to take a more active role in backing liberation movements in southern Africa. It is moving to increase funding, and eventual training of liberation troops cannot be ruled out. Lagos is also moving into closer regional economic relationships with its francophone neighbors. However, the present situation in Africa affords few opportunities for Nigeria to exert leadership. Older, more prestigious heads of state than <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> now dominate the Organization of African Unity and other African councils. Addis Ababa rather than Lagos is the spiritual and bureaucratic “capital of Africa”. Also, the traditional differences between francophone and anglophone states and rising nationalism and antiforeign sentiment are barriers to possible Nigerian aspirations to continental leadership.</p>
                        <p>41. If domestic conditions are sufficiently tranquil for Nigeria to devote more attention to international questions, it will probably become more active, and certainly more vocal, in efforts to alleviate the growing plight of the poorer countries. As a producer of primary goods, agricultural and mineral, for consumers in the rich countries, Nigeria will become more conscious of the widening economic gap between the two worlds. Given its low economic base, its fast growing population, and the looming problems of vast urban unemployment, Nigeria over the next decade will probably manifest considerable frustration and resentment of the rich world, and will join with other major countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa in efforts to bring pressure upon the rich.</p>

                        <p>In reporting on his recent consultations in Lagos during the period January 8-28, 1971, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said he was under instructions to make a strong demarche upon his return about the ease with which former top leaders of the Biafran regime are being permitted to enter the United States. According to the Ambassador, their presence here was causing increasing resentment among <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> officials and could become a serious irritant in our relations. He said the subject figured prominently when the Supreme Military Council met to consider President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>ʼs invitation to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> for a State visit in the United States. Some members of the Council wanted the invitation to be declined, questioning how General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> could come to a country which welcomed individuals who tried to destroy the Nigerian Republic. Others proposed linking acceptance of the invitation with a promise by the United States to reject further visa applications by colleagues of Ojukwu. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> claimed that General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> was being accused of softness toward the United States in not reactin firmly to our favorable treatment of ex-Biafran officials. The General was therefore becoming very upset over our freedom of entry policy and puzzled that the United States would allow a problem of this nature to be introduced to disturb the present good relation-ships between the United States and Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> speculated that the admission of former Biafran leaders could lead to a further complication in relations when requests were made by the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to extradite some of them for war crimes. He indicated the pressures were building up in Nigeria total to <pb n="2" xml:id="d202-02" facs="d202-02"/>account those responsible for the rebellion. Accordingly, he thought there was considerable likelihood that the U.S. Government would eventually be faced with warrants for arrests and extradition of top Biafrans in the United States who had helped lead the secession. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs point was that it would be easier to deny admission now than for the U.S. Government to become involved later in extradition proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The ex-Biafrans allowed to travel to the United States about whom the Ambassador seemed particularly concerned were <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">C.C. MOJEKWU</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DK2">Kenneth Dike</persName>, Augustine Okwu, and Peter Chigbo. He accused all of making anti-<gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> speeches at the universities and other forums. He said <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> had been especially poisonous in appearances at Amherst, Harvard and Princeton. In the case of <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> complained of the B-1 visa acquired by <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> in Lisbon during the war which had enabled him to visit the United States freely in recent months. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> seemed to be unaware of the new application that <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> has submitted to come here with his family on a non-immigrant visa to attend courses at Northwestern. I did not inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>ʼs present effort to enter the United States as a student.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> raised during the course of a luncheon the question of the admission to the U.S. of key members of the former Biafran regime. Referring to his recent consultation, he said that General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> made a special point of emphasizing to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> the problem posed by the continuing admission and activities in the U.S. of the former Biafrans. General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, according to the Ambassador, was being criticized by anti-American elements for his friendship with the U.S. and for the stance which the U.S. seemed to be taking on this issue. The Ambassador said also that Nigeria might wish to recall some of the figures of the Biafran regime for trial.</p>
                        <p>In response, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> expressed surprise that this matter had been raised since he had not been aware that it was still an issue. He had seen nothing in the American press about continuing efforts of former Biafrans. He knew that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> had been aware of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK2">Dike</persName>ʼs appointment to Harvard and there had been no objection.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> reiterated that there were a number of key figures in the U.S. and that they were continuing to make statements which got back to him and got back to Lagos. He mentioned particularly Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> and a long speech that the latter had made at Amherst.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said he knew of the <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> case and that the question of a visa for him was currently pending. The U.S. is limited in what it can do either in restricting the admission of otherwise qualified applicants or in extraditing people for political crimes. There is a particular sensitivity about the tradition of asylum <pb n="2" xml:id="d203-02" facs="d203-02"/>as the recent case of the Lithuanian seaman demonstrated. It is important that the Nigerian Government understand U.S. limitations so that there be no misunderstandings in the future. In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> asked what the British position was toward the residence of former regime figures. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said the British watched them more closely and had “special arrangements” with the Nigerians to keep them under control.</p>
                        <p>Pointing out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> was traveling on a Sierra Leone passport, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> asked why Nigeria did not raise the problem with its fellow African state. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> acknowledged that this might be done. He asked whether the Department could advise him confidentially of the nationality of passport carried by former Biafrans whom he might list. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> promised to look into this.</p>
                        <p>Stressing that it was in the interest of both parties to define the problem clearly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> suggested that Mr. FOLEY might prepare an informal paper for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> on our pertinent visa regulations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said this would be helpful.</p>

                            <item>Finding Under Section 3(a)(1) of the Foreign Military Sales Act</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The enclosed formal memorandum requests you make a finding that the furnishing of defense articles and defense services to Nigeria will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. Such a finding is required under Section 3(a)(1) of the Foreign Military Sales Act before any sales of defense articles and defense services can be made to Nigeria by the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the Nigerian civil war, Nigeria had been found eligible to purchase defense articles and defense services from the United States Government. During the civil war, a decision was made not to provide arms to either side in the Nigerian conflict. Consequently, Nigeria was not included on subsequent eligibility lists. During the thirteen months since the conclusion of the civil war, top Nigerian officials have shown renewed and persistent interest in sending military personnel to schools in the United States operated by the Department of Defense. We intend to limit our grant training program in FY 71 to courses related to civic action. However, the Nigerians have indicated their readiness to purchase other types of military training. The present determination is necessary to make Nigeria eligible to purchase such training under the Foreign Military Sales Act.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy in Lagos and the Departments of State and Defense strongly endorse this request believing that the training in question would do much to increase the professionalism of Africaʼs largest army. It would help in the long run in promoting stability in Nigeria, with a concomitant impact in West Africa and perhaps in Africa as a whole. The training would work toward promoting the continued pro-Western influence in this large and very important nation, one which may well <pb n="3" xml:id="d204-03" facs="d204-03"/>assume a leading position in the non-aligned world. In view of the importance of Nigeria to Africa and the non-aligned world and the extent of U.S. interests there, we believe the purchase of military training by Nigeria will strengthen the security of the U.S. and promote world peace. While some adverse Congressional reaction is anticipated, the finding recommended in this memorandum is not expected to cause widespread discussion.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you sign the attached finding, required by the Foreign Military Sales Act, to allow the sale of defense articles and defense services to Nigeria. The Department of Defense concurs in this recommendation. I also recommend that your finding be reported to the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

                            <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs Meeting with the Secretary on Admission to U.S. of <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">C.C. MOJEKWU</persName>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Secretary on April 6 received Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> who returned from Lagos with instructions from General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> to seek an appointment to protest our granting of a visa to <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">C.C. MOJEKWU</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador opened discussion by noting pleasure of General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> over present good relationships between U.S. and Nigeria. He expressed personal appreciation of General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> training in engineering and technical fields which the General considered would be a key factor in enhancing Nigerian Army usefulness in civil work projects for post-war development. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> was also most grateful for the $15 million <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> reconstruction loan, especially for the promptness of the offer which he believed had significantly influenced the World Bank to propose its $80 million program loan.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d205-02" facs="d205-02"/>
                        <p>3. In light this revived cordial atmosphere General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, according to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>, was bewildered by our willingness to admit <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>. He therefore asked the Ambassador to raise subject with the Secretary whom General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> felt had had a major hand in the rapid improvement in U.S./Nigerian relations over the last year. Message General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> wanted to get across was that our decision on <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> had placed him in a difficult position within <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. The General had put his name and prestige on the line in asking through previous representations that the visa not be approved. His position vis-a-vis anti-American elements within Nigeria had now been weakened and it would be harder for him to counsel moderation as he had in the past when future bilateral issues arise with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>4. In registering other concerns of General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> regarding <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>ʼs admission, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> reiterated points <pb n="3" xml:id="d205-03" facs="d205-03"/>he had made on earlier occasions to <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>. He maintained that <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>ʼs presence could become a major problem in our relations since the latter is a chronic troublemaker who likely both to incite Nigerian students in U.S. against <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> and to cooperate with residual elements of former Biafra lobby. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> asserted that <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> would serve as vehicle for collecting funds here and claimed to have evidence latter visited Ojukwu in February at which time <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> turned over $1 million for Ojukwuʼs continuing clandestine efforts against FMG.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary in response asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> to thank General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> for his expressions of appreciation and to inform him that the Secretary too was pleased with the progress in the improvement of relations between the two governments. The Secretary therefore hoped this one incident would not be allowed to loom large in the overall picture. He hoped the General would be able to understand <pb n="4" xml:id="d205-04" facs="d205-04"/>that the decision on <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> was a consular act that resulted from the application of our laws and had nothing to do with our policy toward Nigeria. The Secretary stressed the limitations of our system which do not allow discretion to keep people out when requirements of the law are fulfilled, even though politically the Executive Branch might want to exclude an individual.</p>
                        <p>6. As for possibility <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> might while here undertake actions inimical to <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>, the Secretary assured that the USG would take steps to deport him if he should engage in such activities. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> was requested to bring any information he received along these lines immediately to Departmentʼs attention. However the Secretary stressed we would need concrete evidence and documentation in order support a review of <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>ʼs case by the Attorney General and that legal proceedings could not be taken merely on the basis of gossip.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d205-05" facs="d205-05"/>
                        <p>7. The Secretary further indicated that we look forward to <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName>ʼs departure at end of the one year period for which his visa is valid. He also promised that any requests by <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">Mojekwu</persName> for extension or conversion of the visa at expiry would be very carefully reviewed by USG.<lb/>GP-3<lb/>END</p>

Legislative restrictions regarding the supply of defense articles to Africa, the current $40 million ceiling on USG provision approaching of arms to Africa (which we are already for FY 71), and general Congressional wariness on the matter of arms for Nigeria as aftermath of the civil war experience dictate that we move cautiously on any prospective military materiel sales program for Nigeria.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was held at the request of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> to discuss the sessions in Paris on May 3-4 of the Consultative Group for Nigeria and future U.S.-Nigerian aid relationships. The essential points covered were:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador reiterated the disappointment of Finance Permanent Secretary Ayida, Economic Development Permanent Secretary Ebong and himself over what they considered to have been our unresponsiveness in Paris. He described the debate that had taken place within the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> before Nigeria agreed to a Consultative Group meeting, noting the negative feeling of Nigerians on previous meetings before the civil war which they viewed as having been counterproductive in providing benefits for Nigeria and excessive in self-approbation by donor countries. On balance, however, it had been decided that the Paris meeting could be useful as a means of measuring current attitudes of the potential donors toward the Second Four-Year Development Plan. It was thought moreover that the meeting would furnish the opportunity to outline the urgent need of the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> for external, foreign exchange assistance in the period immediately ahead <pb n="2" xml:id="d208-02" facs="d208-02"/>to sustain Nigeriaʼs economic recovery pending the full resumption of its potential foreign exchange earnings.</p>
                        <p>This frame of reference had brought the Nigerians to Paris and they had expected that the United States would take the lead in helping to fill the substantial balance of payments deficit. Instead our delegation had given a negative and desultory performance that aggravated the Nigerians and, according to <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>, left Bank officials and other countriesʼ delegations puzzled. Contrary to the imagination and forthcomingness of the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> claimed that the United States presentation seemed to look backward rather than focusing on avenues for future assistance. In his view, our behavior at Paris certainly was not conducive to a speedy mobilization of external financial resources for Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>In particular he felt that it was the U.S. delegationʼs sanctimonious attitude that had caused the greatest disappointment -- the way in which we had repeated the pledge of a $15 million program loan when in fact it had been offered immediately at the end of the war for 1970 and in no sense related to future assistance. Moreover, the U.S. delegation had given the unhappy impression that this was not for immediate draw-down but would be disbursed over the next 18-24 months. According to Iyalla, if limitations on future aid were such that we could not make a commitment, the Nigerians believed that the United States representatives at Paris should have honestly admitted our problem and not have adopted a self- congratulatory position which conveyed the impression that the United States was contributing significantly to Nigeriaʼs present needs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">FUTURE U.S. AID RELATIONS IN NIGERIA</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> dwelt extensively on the need to improve <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>ʼs image in Nigeria. He said that it was difficult for Nigerians to understand the limitations on our providing large-scale assistance when the feeling is that the United States could help if it really wanted to. He argued that we, as a special friend of Nigeria, had failed his country once with our refusal to sell arms when Nigeria most needed our aid. The reasons for our posture during the war had finally begun to be appreciated by much of the populace. But now in peacetime we were again turning Nigeria aside when significant help was anticipated as a reflection of our increased political good will.</p>
                        <p>In light of the unfavorable attitude regarding the level of U.S. assistance, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> stressed that everything possible had to be done to tailor our aid actions in Nigeria to reflect the <pb n="3" xml:id="d208-03" facs="d208-03"/>constraints that now exist on future assistance programs. This he, felt might help develop an awareness of the legislative limitations in the United States which presently prevail on making future commitments. He suggested that USAID personnel in Nigeria should not get involved so much in discussions of new project proposals with state authorities which raise false hopes and unrealistic expectations. He thought now that our technical assistance funds were limited that they could be more judiciously employed and applied to more useful areas of endeavor. In his view many of our projects, though possibly altruistic, were useless and not of much impact in development of the country. In this connection, he singled out particularly the university programs which he maintained were bogus, suspect and self-perpetuating. Instead of setting up departments in academic institutions, he believed that the funds should be used for the training of more Nigerians abroad. He criticized exchange programs which brought intellectual specialists, basketball and tennis players, and other “exotic” experts to Nigeria. Finally, he condemned severely the waste of money which occurs on feasibility studies for projects which never get underway.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">U.S. POSITION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In responding to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>, Mr. Smith spoke of the usefulness of the Consultative Group meeting. If for no other reason, he indicated that it had been invaluable because it had led to a frank exchange of views that promised more candid communication between the United States and Nigeria in future relationships regarding aid. He suggested, however, that there was no point engaging in recriminations over past activities. Instead we should look to how best we could work together in the years ahead. Mr. Smith stressed that the time for multi-year aid commitments from the United States was gone and therefore our delegations could not usefully talk about major future assistance to Nigeria. On the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, he felt that the door remained open for additional program loan support. Much would depend on the expedition and sagacity with which the present $80 million loan was drawn down. If disbursement were handled responsibly, Mr. Smith believed there would be a sympathetic and positive interest by the United States for another World Bank loan. Mr. Smith hoped that the Nigerians understood that 40%
of the Bankʼs resources come from the United States. Thus indirectly we had contributed significantly to Nigeria by means of the $80 million loan.</p>
                        <p>As for bilateral assistance from the United States, Mr. Smith pointed out that it was hard to tell at this stage how much money would be available. If the present $15 million program loan were disbursed rapidly, he believed additional program aid might be <pb n="4" xml:id="d208-04" facs="d208-04"/>considered. However, Mr. Smith speculated that perhaps a sector loan or project loan would be a more feasible way of using limited available resources. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> was not enthusiastic about more project loans, citing past bad experiences; but he thought a sector approach might be useful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Smith stressed that we wanted to follow the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>ʼs lead regarding priorities for projects and technical assistance. It was up to the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> to make these priorities clear to us. Moreover, when problems developed and the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> considered that performance under a technical assistance contract was not turning out as anticipated, Mr. Smith asserted that we wished to be told and would in agreement with the Nigerian Government work ourselves out of it as quickly as possible. In reference to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs contempuous re-marks on the economic worthlessness of some of our projects, Mr. Smith noted that the Ambassador was apparently mixing up USAID assistance with our cultural programs. To set the record straight, Mr. Smith thought this confusion should be cleared up by our providing a list of various U.S. programs in Nigeria which carefully delineated between those financed by USAID,<gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>One final point which Mr. Smith emphasized concerning bilateral assistance was to draw Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs attention to the use-fulness of the EXIM Bank as a source of future financing in Nigeria, Mr. Smith stressed the vaster resources and flexibility which the EXIM Bank possesses in negotiating loans and guarantees. He suggested now Nigeria had become accustomed to working with the Bank and familiar with its procedures, and was soon coming to the point at which soft terms would be less critical, that the latter could become a valuable adjunct in Nigeriaʼs development effort.</p>

                        <p>The meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> closed with a discussion of the Presidentʼs plan to reorganize <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.

                        <p>Although candid, the discussion was conducted in a calm manner. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> and Mr. Smith both welcomed the opportunity to get these matters on the table.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Nigeriaʼs population of 60 million, its economic vitality and potential, and its military strength (250,000 men) make it one of the major centers of influence and power on the African continent.</p>
                        <p>2. U.S. investments in Nigerian oil (production and marketing) have increased to $600 million recently. The outlook is for further expansion. Nigeria also is a supplemental and back-up source of supply for petroleum, particularly for Europe.</p>
                        <p>3. There is a growing mutual awareness between the black community in the United States and in Nigeria and a growing interest in each otherʼs problems.</p>
                        <p>4. As the worldʼs ninth most populous country, Nigeria holds promise as a market for U.S. exports.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. To put our bilateral relations with Nigerian leadership, both civilian and military, on a firmer basis and permitting a more effective dialogue.</p>
                        <p>2. To encourage Nigerian leadership to continue their moderate outlook.</p>
                        <p>3. To encourage economic growth and the development of political structures which can promote stability and maintain unity within present boundaries.</p>
                        <p>4. To increase U.S. access to resources and markets.</p>
                        <p>5. To bring Nigeriaʼs economic potential to bear on African regional development efforts.</p>

                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Concentrate resources available through the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program on Nigeriaʼs most critical reconstruction and development needs as expressed in the new Four Year Plan and continue to stress rapid implementation of prior commitments (See Annex D).</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Specifically:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) Provision of reconstruction assistance through program lending in FY 1971 and, assuming a continuing consideration of additional capital assistance, through either program or sector lending in FY 1972. Support to the police in FY 1971 or FY 1972 for construction of a new Police College.</p>
                        <p>(b) Continuation of technical assistance, emphasizing agriculture, education, and other productive sectors where our capabilities and interests coincide with the wishes of the <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(c) Timely execution of existing capital projects and early completion of relief and rehabilitation activities.</p>
                        <p>(d) Development, preferably on a multi-lateral basis, of regional assistance programs which promote closer economic ties between Nigeria and its neighbors, such as the Lake Chad Basin Commission.</p>
                        <p>2. Maintain cultural and educational exchanges, both official and private, including contacts between distinguished Nigerians in all official and private fields with their American counterparts.</p>
                        <p>3. Provide civic action-oriented military training under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. Supplement <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> with sales of conventional military training courses and, if requested, of equipment.</p>
                        <p>4. Maintain police training programs. 5. Encourage contacts between U.S. and Nigerian trade unions.</p>
                        <p>6. Keep before Nigerian leaders, policymakers, and men of influence a clear picture of U.S. progress, improvements, <pb n="5" xml:id="d209-05" facs="d209-05"/>and policy in the field of race relations. With regard to southern Africa problems, make clear the distinctions that exist between U.S. interests and policy toward southern Africa and those of some of our allies.</p>
                        <p>7. Encourage Nigeria to maintain a favorable climate for foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>8. Continue to bring trade and investment opportunities to the attention of American businessmen, assure that America business is not discriminated against, and acquaint Nigerians with American products. The Export-Import Bank should maintain the flexibility necessary to enable U.S. firms to meet a high degree of competition.</p>
                        <p>9. Continue stressing to Nigerians the benefits of generalized tariff preferences. If Nigeria renews overtures to associate with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, try to assure that the agreement does not set up reverse preferences or further complicate the emergence of a system of generalized preferences.</p>
                        <p>10. Discourage the activities of residual pro-Biafran groups in the United States.</p>

                        <p>His Excellency<lb/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>
                            <lb/>President of the United States of America,<lb/>The White House,<lb/>WASHINGTON, D.C.</p>
                        <p>My dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>I wrote to you earlier in the year to accept with profound gratitude your very kind invitation to me to visit the United States of America. While our officials were trying to suggest mutually convenient dates for the visit, I continued my programme of State Visits to a number of African countries particularly to thank their Governments and peoples for the unwavering support they gave to me during the civil war in my country as well as to promote vital interests common to our peoples. At the same time, I was, and continue to be, intensely preoccupied with the formulation and implementation of my countryʼs current Development Plan. In the midst of the foregoing commitments, I have had to accept a number of urgently necessary assignments under the aegis of the Organisation or African Unity affecting the peace and progress of Africa. In the firm belief that my visit to your great country would cement further the cordial and friendly relations which so happily exist between our two countries, I still hoped to be able to visit your country this year. Hence the delay in indicating my preferences for the dates in October suggested by your officials.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d210-02" facs="d210-02"/>
                        <p>I am afraid I am still not free of my immediate preoccupations at home and in Africa. With the coming fall and winter, and having regard to the arrangements which you will have to make in so short a time to receive me in the midst of your other many pressing engagements, I hesitate to suggest that the visit be postponed till later in the year. Consequently, I want to take the liberty of our friendship to express the hope that your invitation to me to visit you remains still valid and open. I shall therefore be highly delighted if another mutually acceptable date for my visit can be fixed through our diplomatic channels, preferably not within this year.</p>
                        <p>I deeply regret my inability to visit your country this year. The decision has been forced on me by circumstances beyond my control. As a man with an abiding interest in my country and Africa, I trust that you will understand my position.</p>
                        <p>Accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your kind letter of September 18 explaining the urgent concerns in Nigeria and Africa which rule out for the present your undertaking a journey to the United States. I have looked forward to our meeting and genuinely regret its postponement. At the same time, however, I am encouraged by the ongoing success of your Governmentʼs policies at home and the broadening scope of your personal involvement in decisions affecting peace and prosperity in Africa. In these endeavors, you have my continuin support and my warmest wishes for success. I want to assure you that my invitation remains open, and I hope that, as our respective commitments for next year become clearer, it will be possible to find a mutually convenient time for our meeting.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> had asked rather urgently on Friday November 5 whether it would be possible to have one of our periodic across the board conversations about matters affecting USG and <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. Such meetings have usually been more exploratory, informal and supplemental than the regular meetings between the Ambassador and Country Director, FOLEY.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> had two concerns, one was that the US Embassy in Nigeria had been reclassified from class I to class II.</p>
                        <p>I gather that this information came to him from Lagos sources and he admitted that they had been probably circulated and underscored by “outsiders who wished to make mischief between us.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said the first information was that the embassy had been reclassified but subsequently he learned that the reclassification covered the Aid Mission and was based on reduced aid expenditures. He asked if I could clarify the situation.</p>
                        <p>I was really taken aback at both the information having been learned so quickly by the Nigerians and by the <pb n="2" xml:id="d212-02" facs="d212-02"/>directness in raising the subject. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said that his governmentʼs concern was compounded by the additional story again attributed to “outsiders” that the downgrading in class and the assignment of a Black Ambassador went hand in hand with the US in placing his country on the “back burner”. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said that the subject had first been discussed between his External Affairs Commissioner Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> and himself in New York at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> just prior to <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName>ʼs meeting with the Secretary. Joe said that the Secretaryʼs effussive comments about Reinhardt went a long way in correcting this ill-conceived story and that <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> himself reminded <persName corresp="#p_AO1">Arikpo</persName> of the Secretaryʼs continued interest in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>I concurred in <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs statement and elaborated on the Secretaryʼs respect and enthusiasm for Ambassador Reinhardt and the Secretaryʼs knowledge of and interest in Nigerian Affairs.</p>
                        <p>I explained to <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> that I was not aware of any specific decision which had been taken with regards to our Embassy in Nigeria, that I have been away from my desk on a special assignment, but, I was aware that the Department was looking at a number of embassies around the world. I added that this was a periodic exercise that occurs between the time of a departing ambassador and the arrival of a new one.</p>
                        <p>I said I knew that Ghana was another country in Africa which was also being re-examined and that this effort had nothing to do with the importance we attached to a country, but rather was an in-house matter concerning administrative costs and size of the official American presence in a country. I said Nigeria still receives the greatest attention of all <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> countries, not only in the African Bureau but in the Department and in other branches of the Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> said another reason Lagos would look with discomfort and displeasure at being reclassified was that it occurs at a time when his country was moving forward in terms of its own development and in its leadership in Africa. I indicated that I would check the status of the situation and would be back in touch on this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d212-03" facs="d212-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs second concern related to an earlier informal discussion when we discussed the possibility of a visit to Nigeria by Vice President <persName corresp="#p_AST1">Agnew</persName>. The Ambassador placed the highest importance on such a visit and said the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> would most welcome the Vice President. He hoped that such a visit might be possible in the near future if the President himself would not be traveling in Africa. Iyalla said that the Nigerians would not be offended by Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in by-passing Nigeria in view of their belief that sheʼll probably only be going to Liberia and Ghana.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> mentioned with pleasure President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>ʼs warm letter to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> regarding the proposed State visit. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> asked where things stood in reference to a visit next year. I said again I had no information but that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>ʼs letter seemed to speak for itself. I asked Iyalla if he had ideas about when the General would like to come and suggested the ball was now in Nigeriaʼs court. I said my private view was that the Nigerians might better propose certain periods of time and then we could explore their acceptability. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> agreed that this might be a better approach and said he hoped to return to Lagos for consultation in December. He would initiate action from that end.</p>
                        <p>I finally asked <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> if he could give me any further insight into the Nigerian proposal to expel South Africa from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said he was not aware of the background on this move but that Ogbu was probably being pushed by certain of his African colleagues and that Nigeria had to indulge in a certain amount of rhetoric to maintain its credentials with <gloss target="#t_OAU1">O.A.U.</gloss> He said that the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> can better counsel reason and moderation on some matters when it identifies with selected radical positions from time to time. He promised to obtain a reading on this for me.</p>

                            <item>SUMMARY: IN A LONG MEETING OCTOBER 17, MEA PERMANENT SECRETARY JOE IYALLA DETAILED A LONG LIST OF ALLEGEDLY CALCULATED AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO DOWNGRADE NIGERIA HE COVERED THE WATERFRONT, FROM THE MOJEKWU CASE TO THE JULY MURDER OF A NIGERIAN IN LOS ANGELES IT ALL ADDS UP TO A PATTERN OF AMERICAN INDIFFERENCE AND PENCHANT TO TAKE NIGERIA FOR GRANTED MEETING NOT UNPLEASANT AND SERVED USEFUL PURPOSE OF PERMITTING HIM TO UNLOAD. WE NEED EXPLANATIONS BUT SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO TURN THE TIDE VERY QUICKLY. MOJEKWU LIKELY TO BE GENUINE IRRITANT AS LONG AS HE REMAINS IN THE UNITED STATES. IYALLA QUITE CAPABLE OF TRANSFERRING HIS PASSIONATELY HELD CONVICTIONS TO OTHERS.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>YESTERDAY I CONFERRED IN THE MEA WITH PERMANENT SECRETARY IYALLA FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE HOURS AT HIS REQUEST. HE STATED THAT HE WANTED TO REVIEW THE BIDDING AND PROCEEDED TO REVRAL THAT, BY HIS RECKONING, HE HAD DEALT HIMSELF EVERY TRUMP IN THE DECK BUT HOPED THAT WE COULD HAVE A FRIENDLY GAME. INDEED, HIS THEME AND MANNER WERE MARKED BY FRIENDSHIP FOR “FRIENDS MUST REMOVE ISOLATED IRRITANTS BEFORE THEY GROW INTO ‘MALIGNANCY’” HE DID NOT WISH TO DWELL ON SEMANTICS, BUT REALLY “IRRITANT” WAS USED ONLY BECAUSE HE, A NATIVE IJAW SPEAKER, DID NOT HAVE THE ENGLISH NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE <pb n="2" xml:id="d213-02" facs="d213-02"/>“THE SEEMINGLY DELIBERATE AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO TAKE NIGERIA FOR GRANTED AND TO CREATE ANTI-NIGERIAN FEELING IN THE UNITED STATES.” I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS RELIEVED THAT HE ADDED “IN THE UNITED STATES” FOR I COULD CERTAINLY THINK OF NO “IRRITANTS” IN NIGERIA THAT WOULD FIT HIS PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION. HE ASSURED ME THAT BEFORE HE FINISHED HE WOULD POINT OUT A FEW IN NIGERIA TOO, BUT THAT HIS MAIN CONCERN WAS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH NIGERIA WAS BEING IGNORED IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS SEEMED STRANGE TO ME IN THE LIGHT OF THE RECENT AMICABLE MEETING BETWEEN SECRETARY ROGERS AND COMMISSIONER ARIKPO. HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THIS MEETING AT A HIGH LEVEL BUT WANTED TO DESCEND TO A LOWER LEVEL “WHERE THE MUNDANE MATTERS THAT REALLY CONCERN NATIONS ARE IMPORTANT.” I REPLIED THAT I NEVER LIKE TO DESCEND BUT THAT HIS INITIAL SPARRING WAS LIKE THE PENULTIMATE CHAPTER IN A BOOK OFIFICTION AND THAT I COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THE DENOUEMENT. HE SMILED AND PROMISED “TO MOVE TO REALITY,” INTO WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>FIRST, THERE IS THE MOJEKWU MATTER. THIS IS AN OLD STORY, HE KNEW, BUT IT IS RESURFACING, “EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” BECAUSE THE FMG NOW HAS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE THAT MOJEKWU IS INFLUENCING INDIVIDUAL IBOS IN THE US, AT A TIME WHEN THE FMG THOUGHT THAT THESE EX-REBELS HAD BECOME RECONCILED. MOJEKWU OUTSMARTS US AUTHORITIES BY NOT AGITATING PUBLICLY, BUT THE DAMAGE IS JUST AS GREAT. OUR “UNNECESSARY DECISION” TO ADMIT HIM WAS BAD ENOUGH, ESPECIALLY SINCE BY DOING SO WE HAD REJECTED A SPECIAL REQUEST FROM THE HEAD OF STATE, BUT UNLESS HE HAS LEFT WITHIN “THE LAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE COMPOUNDED OUR “ORIGINAL SIN” BY OUTRIGHT RENEGING ON A PROMISE TO EXPEL: HIM ONE YEAR FROM FEBRUARY, 1971, WHEN THE VISA WAS GRANTED. HE REALIZED THAT WE CITED JUNE, 1971, AT THE DATE OF ENTRY, BUT THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF GRANTING THE VISA WAS FEBRUARY. STILL, EVEN IF HE ACCEPTS OUR DATE, WE HAVE FAILED TO EXPEL HIM. WHY? THIS WAN WAS LIVING IN COMFORT IN PORTUGAL, OUR ENEMY, BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT HE IS PERMITTED TO DWELL AMONG ASSUMED FRIENDS IN THE US. HE ASSURED ME THAT “THIS TRAVESTY OF AMERICAN CONCERN FOR AN INNOCENT VISA APPLICANT” WAS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE ISLAND CLUB BY ORDINARY NIGERIANS BUT ALSO IN DODAN BARRACKS.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>HE PLEADED THAT I NOT RESPOND TO HIS INDIVIDUAL EXAMPLES BUT THAT I SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON "THE WHOLE PATTERN OF <pb n="3" xml:id="d213-03" facs="d1-03"/>AMERICAN INDIFFERENCE." THUS, HE APOLOGIZED FOR MOVING ON TO POINT TWO, "WHICH IS THE MATTER OF  COMMISSIONER DIKKO’S SHABBY TREATMFNT AT DULLES AIRPORT, THE SCENE OF INNUMERABLE INDIGNITIES TO HIGH LEVEL NIGERIAN VISITORS. TO MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.” NOW, COMMISSIONER DTKKN IS a SAINTLY, GENTLE MAN WHO HAS A REPUTATION FOR NEVER COMPLAINING, BUT EVEN HE “THOUGHT THIS” DOWNRIGHT SHABBY TREATMENT, MUST TELL YOU TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.” I APOLOGIZED FOR BREAKING HIS GROUND RULE, BUT OBSERVED ThAT I HAD TALKED WITH THE COMMISIONER: AT LEAST TWICE IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN FROM WASHINGTON AND HAD RECEIVED NOTHING RUT EXPRESSION OF UNLIMITED PRAISE. “OH, YOU MUST REALIZE THAT THE COMMISSIONER IS SO KIND. WE WOULD NEVER TELL YOU, BUT HE CERTAINLY TOLD US INCLUDING GENERAL GOWON WHO WAS DISMAYED AND WAS VERGING ON ORDERING SIMILAR TREATMENT FOR AMERICAN AT IKEJA UNTIL I INTERVENED.” I PERSISTED THAT OBVIOUSLY RETALIATION WITHOUT OFFERING ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR CORRECTING ALLEGED WRONGS WOULD HAVE BEEN, “TO USE YOUR FAVORITE WORD, A NIGERIAN TRAVESTY.” FURTHER, DIKKO TRAVELED IN MAY, AND YOU HAVE WAITED SIX MONTHS BEFORE MENTIONING THE PROBLEM AND EVEN NOW GENER-. ALIZE ABOUT “SHABBY TREATMENT,” WHICH IS UNCORRECTABLE BECAUSE UNDEFINaBLE. HE COULD BE SPECIFIC: POOR, OLD MAN MADE To CARRY HIS OWN BAGS BECAUSE NIGERIAN EMBASSY PERSONNEL COULD NOT REACH HIM “BEYOND YOUR BARRIERS,” AND REPEATEDLY “MADE TO QUEUE UP LIKE ALL ORDINARY PASSENGERS.”</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>THEN THERE IS THE CASE OF NAZIF MOHAMMED, A DULY ACCREDITED MEMBER OF THE NIGERIAN EMBASSY STAFF-IN WASHINGTON. A RECOGNIZED DIPLOMAT, WHO IN JULY, 1972, WAS “MANHANDLED BY THE WASHINGTON <pb n="4" xml:id="d213-04" facs="d213-04"/>POLICE." HE REALISES THAT INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS CAN GET OUT OF HAND, "ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE LIKE WASHINGTON." WHAT PUZZLES HIM “AND OTHER AT THE HLGEST LEVEL” IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE WILL NOT EVEN ANSWER OUR FORMAL PROTESTS, MADE ORALLY AND SUBMITTED IN WRITING ON AUGUST 2, 1972. “TODAY IS OCTOBER 17, AND WE STILL AWAIT AN ANSWER.” HE GAVE ME A COPY OF HIS EMBASSY’S NOTE WITH "REFERENCE NO. DXI/L," WHICH DOES DETAIL A STIFF PROTEST.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>STILL WORSE, IN IYALLA’S OPINION BUT “NOT IF THAT OF SOME OF MY HIGH LEVEL COLLEAGUES, WHO WILL NEVER GET OVER THE MOJEKWU MATTER,” IS THE CASE OF MRS. LILY SMITH, AN AMERICAN LADY WHO PICKETED OUR  EMBASSY “FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS,” SPLASHED OUR WALL WITH RED PAINT, AND PAINTED “SURRILOUS, ANTI-NIGERIAN REMARKS -ON OUR OWN PROPERTY.” MRS. SMITH SEEMED TO THE EMBASSY STAFF TO BE DEMENTED AND SHOULD BE PITIED AND FORGIVEN. WHAT HE CAN NOT FORGIVE IS THE “TOTAL FAILURE OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE, THE EXECUTIVE PROTECTIVE AGENCY, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE TO ANSWER OUR DESPERATE PLEAS FOR PERIOD OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE WOULD ANSWER YOUR PLEAS AT YOUR EMBASSY HERE, FOR WE RECOGNIZE IT AS OUR DUTY TO PROTECT FOREIGN ESTABLISHMENTS.”</item>
                            <pb n="5" xml:id="d213-05" facs="d1-05"/>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>THE PATTERN OF INDIFFERENCE CONTINUES TO UNFOLD, HE OBSERVED, FOR ALSO IN JULY, 1972, ONE DR. ADIGUN, A DECENT, UPSTANDING NIGERIAN CITIZEN, WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD AND IN VERY SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IN LOS ANGELES. FOR A LONG PERIOD THE NIGERIAN EMBASSY WAS NOT EVEN NOTIFIED, USING ITS OWN MEANS, THE EMRASSY FINALLY LEARNED OF THIS DESPICABLE ACT, PROTESTED TO THE DEPARTMENT, AND WAS ROUTINELY PROMISED AN INVESTIGATION BY THE FRI. TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT, “WHICH IS NOT THE WAY ONE TREATS FRIENDS.” DR. ADIGUN IS WELL CONNECTED IN NIGERIA, AND HIS FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE “PROTESTED TO THE HIGEST LEVEL... I MUST TELL YOU THESE THINGS ARE DISCUSSED AT THE ISLAND CLUB AND (UNDERLINE AND) AT DODAN BARRAKS.”</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>HE ROULD REPEAT “NUMEROUS OTHER EXAMPLES THAT FORM A PATTERN, A PATTERN OF SOMETHING CLOSE TO CONTEMPT FOR NIGERIAN,” BUT HE WANTED TO RUSH ON TO A FEW PROBLEMS HERE IN NIGERIA, FOREMOST THE “MOST SERIOUS” IS THE JURA CASE (REPORTED IN SEPTEL ).</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>THE PERMANENT SECRETARY IS ALSO DISTURBED ABOUT “FREEDOM OF THE PRESS SEMINARS CONDUCTED BY YOUR PEOPLE HERE.” HE DOURTED THAT THERE IS ANY PROBLEM BUT HAD RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS FROM “PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED.” ALL HE WANTED NOW WAS FOR “YOUR PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER WITH MY PEOPLE. LET US UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DO, AND WE WILL EXPLAIN THE TOLERABLE LIMITS OF SUCH SEMINARS.”</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>THEN, THERE IS THE CASE OF A RECENT VISIT BY A HIGH-LEVEL EVEN DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN POIITICO-BUS I NESS GROUP, WHO CAME HERE AND IN “TYPICAL AMERICAN FASHION” WANTED TO RUSH IN AND TALK WITH THE HEAD OF STATE AND SEAL A DEAL ON THE SPOT. “I THINK WE GOT THEM STRAIGHT, AND THEY NOW REALIZE THAT NIGERIA IS NOT ONE OF YOUR BANNANA REPUBLICS.” I ASKED WHETHER HE THOUGHT THE USG WAS REPONSIBLE FOR THE GAFFES OF EVERY VISITOR. NO, HE DID NOT, AND ONLY CITED THIS VISIT AS AN EXAMPLE OF “HOW AMERICANS TAKE NIGERIA FOR GRANTED AND DOWGPAOE US WHENEVER THEY CAN.” (CF. MY LETTER TO FOLEY DATE SEPTEMBER 17.)</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>FINALLY, HE REALIZED THAT THE PROPER PLACE FOR DICUSSING <pb n="6" xml:id="d213-06" facs="d213-06"/>MOST OF THES PROBLEMS IS WASHINGTON, WHICH HIS EMBASSY HAD DONE TO NO AVAIL. HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THESE “AFFRONTS” IN ISOLATION, WHAT HE WANTED ME TO UNDERSTAND IS “THE PATTERN, THE CALCULATED TREND OF DOWNGRADING NIGERIA.” I SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT “THIS PATTERN, THIS TREND” IS NOT NEW: HE HAD WATCHED IT DEVELOP AND BECOME WELL ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT HIS TOUR IN WASHINGTON. THE BIG DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT OTHER FMG OFFICIALS, "EVEN POOR DR. DIKKO," ARE BECOMING CONVINCED OF “A PATTERN, A TREND,” WHICH IYALLA NEVER DOUBTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. A FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES, THE PERMANENT SECRETARY WISHED “TO ARREST THE GROWTH OF THIS MALIGNANCY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE FOR BOTH OF OUR COUNTRIES.”</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>IN MY RESPONSE, I BEGAN BY EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR HIS FINALLY BRINGING TO MY ATTENTION MATTERS THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN DISTURBING HIM FOR A LONG PERIOD. INDEED, I WONDERED WHY HE HAD WAITED SO LONG, ESPECIALLY SINE I HAD TALKED WITH HIM MANY TIMES SINCE HCP RETURN IN MAY. HE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY REORGANIZING THE MINISTRY, HE SAID, BUT MORE IMPORTANT HE WANTED TO “COLLECT THE ELEMENTS OF LIE PATTERN.” I TOLD HIM THAT IN MY JUDGMENT IT WAS LITTLE SHORT OF “NONSENSE” TO TALK <pb n="7" xml:id="d213-07" facs="d213-07"/>ABOUT “YOUR PATTERNS AND TRENDS.” I WAS WILLING TO RELIEVE THAT CONSIDERABLE MISUNDERSTANDING HAD ARISEN FOR REASONS THAT I WOULD NOT EXPLAIN BUT THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT HIS EXTENDFD STAY IN THE UNITED STATES HAD NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE NO CULTURAL GROUNDS FOR “YOUR PATTERNS”: WE ARE MUCH TOO DIRECT TO RUILD THE KIND OF PATTERNS THAT YOUR ARE SEEING. “FRANKLY,” I SAID, “ YOUR CASE WOULD BE FAR MORE CONVINCING IF YOU WERE CHARGING IMPETUOUS ACTIONS RATHER THAN STUDIED, DELIBERATE, PARANOIA-LADEN LITTLE INSULTS.” TO ASSIGN PLAUSIBILITY TO HIS ARGUMENT, ONE WOULD NEED TO “SEE LITTLE MEN IN DARK CORNERS STUDYING WAYS TO INSULT NIGERIA” ANY AMBASSADOR WHO HAD STAYED IN WASHINGTON AS LONG AS HE SHOULD KNOW THAT TO MOVE FROM DIKKO TO LILY SMITH TO A LNS ANGELES MURDER IN A PATTERN CALLED FOR INGENUITY FOR BETTER EMPLOYED IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLICY AND MILITARY PROBLEMS GREATER THAN ANY NIGERIA HAD PRESENTED DURING THE PERIOD HE HAD DISCUSSED. I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BEFORE THIS MEETING I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE DIKKO CASE, OF LILY SMITH, AND NAZIF MOHAMMED. WHILE HIS BEST CHANNEL FOR QUICK CORRECTION OF OBVINUS MISUNDERSTANDING IS HIS EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON, I WOULD REPORT HIS VIEWS AND SEEK A RESPONSE. I, OF COURSE, KNEW OF THE MOJEKWU PROBLEM BUT WAS UNWILLING TO SPECULATE BEYOND THE INFORMATION COVEYED BY <pb n="8" xml:id="d213-08" facs="d213-08"/>MR. FOLEY IN MAY, 1972. I REGRETTED THE TRAGIC DEATH OF DR. ADIGUN AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH: HIS EMBASSY REQUEST FOR AN INVESTIGATION, THE RESULTS OF WHICH I WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD SOON HAVE. I HE THOUGHT THAT “SOON” WOULD NOT COVER THE FLAPSE OF TIME SINCE JULY, AND HE MAY BE USING ONE OF HIS TRUMPS QUITE WELL WITH THIS RETORT.) AS FOR THE USIS SEMINARS, HIS REPORTS ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF MINE, FOR WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO CONDUCT FAR MORE THAN WE CAN ARRANGE. I AGREED THAT SOME VISITING AMERICANS EXHIBIT TACTLESSNESS BUT ARGUEDTHAT THEIR RFGRETTABLF CLUMISNESS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH HIS “PATTERNS.”</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>COMMENT: SUCH ARE THE PEREGRINATIONS OF A FRIEND DETERMINED, AS HE PUT IT. TO HELP AMERICA HELP HERSELF. HOWEVER, IYALLA TODAY WAS NEITHER AN IRASCIBLE B. A. CLARK NOT AN UNINFORMED LARRY FEBUNMI. PRESENT IN HIS MANNER WAS THE USUALFEIGNED REGRET TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS AND THE EQUALLY FEIGNED DESIRE TO BE REASONALBE IN PURSUIT OF A MUTUAL GOA. HOWEVER, HE WAS NOT DISAGREEABLE. HE SEEMED GENUINELY CERTAIN THAT HE WAS PRESENTING CAREFULLY SELECTED EXAMPLES THAT CAN NOT BE SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED. THUS, HE HAS HEARD OUR MOJEKWU EXPLANATIONS BUT REJECTS THEM BEFORE WE SPEAK, THOUGH THIS TIME HF ADDS “EVIDENCE” THE THE FORMER BIAFRAN IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT IYALLA SAID WOULD HAPPEN AND THE WE ASSURED HIM WOULD NEVER BE TOLERATED. I AM CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING WENT WRONG DURING THE DIKKO STORY. DIKKO IS FAR FROM THE SAINT THE IYALLA PORTRAYS, BUT HE IS A MILD MAN WHO APPARENTLY HAS CREATED QUITE A RUMPUS HERE. IYALLA MULTIPLIES DIKKO«S EXPERIENCE SEVERAL FOLD, ASSURING THAT IT ESCALATES BEYOND THE IRRITANT LEVEL.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>I CAN GIVE NO ASSESSMENT OF THE OTHER WASHINGTON PROBLEMS, BUT EITHER HIS EMBASSY REPORTING HAS BROKEN DOWN, OR WE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN RATHER SLOW IN RESPONDING TO PROTESTS. HE FLATLY ASSERTS AND REPEATS THAT HE SIMPLY CAN NOT GET ANSWERS.</item>
                            <label>15.</label>
                            <item>THE REFERENCE TO THE SEMINARS IS PRETTY CLEAR. WHILE TALKS REFORE THE PRESS HAVE NOT EMPHASIZED PRESS FREEDOM, HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE CAN BE NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT. YET HE CHOSE NOT TO MAKE HIS POINT TODAY AND BELIEVES THAT BY INDIRECTIONS HE CAN HAVE <pb n="9" xml:id="d213-09" facs="d213-09"/>OTHER ACHIEVE THIS END.</item>
                            <label>16.</label>
                            <item>SINCE IYALLA’S RETURN IN MAY, I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED THAT SOMETHING WAS IN HIS CRAW. THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT TODAY’S REGURGITATION LEAVES HIM EMPTY, BUT IT’S GOOD: TO HAVE WHAT I OBTAINED. CLEARLY WE WILL NEED SOME ANSWERS TO WHAT I GOT TODAY THE ONE THAT WILL HELP MOST IS RESPONSIVENESS TO THE MOJEKWU CASE. I KNOW ALL OF THE DIFFICULTIES PREVIOUSLY CITED, BUT WE ARE WASTING OUR TIME REPEATING THEM TO THE NIGERIANS. AS LONG AS MOJEKWU STAYS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL HAVE A GENUINE “IRRITANT” ON OUR HANDS.</item>

                            <item>IN LEAVING IYALLA, I URGED THAT HE NOT WALT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BEFORE UNLOADING, HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NOT. I VAINLY TRIED TO SUMMZRIZE THE MEETING BY OBSERVING THAT IN TENNESSEE WE WOULD CHARACTERIZE HIS COMPLAINTS, AT BEST, AS "MISUNDERSTANDING" OR "ARERRATION." HE WOULD HAVE NONE OF THAT, NOTHING THAT IJAW IS NOT NEARLY AS RICH AS TENNESSEE ENGLISH BUT THAT IN HIS LANGUAGE THEY HAVE A WORD THAT CAN BE ROUGLY TRANSLATED AS "SHAFTING." SHINING THROUGH HIS WIT IS FAIRLY ACCURATE SUMMARY OF THIS WHOLE DEMARCHE: HE SINCERELY BELIEVES HIS "SHAFTING" AND "PATTERNS" THESIS, AND UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVINCING OTHERS, "AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL," AS HE FONDLY REITERATES.</item>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has recommended that the Nigerian Ambassador pay a farewell call on the President (Tab II). Such a call would be a useful gesture to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, who has become one of Black Africaʼs most important, most respected leaders. He has been sharply disillusioned by US imports of Rhodesian chrome and recently told our Ambassador that we seem to place more importance on White rather than Black African interests. A call on the President would demonstrate that we value his friendship and that we are seriously interested in and are sympathetic to African aspirations. The President is familiar with the Byrd Amendment and with the help of a talker should not be placed in an uncomfortable position should the question of chrome imports arise. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> is an intelligent, outgoing individual.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
                        <p>That you initial the schedule proposal for the President at Tab I.</p>

                        <p>I recommend that you receive Ambassador Joe Iyalla of Nigeria for a farewell call sometime during the last two weeks in April.</p>
                        <p>With his close connections to General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, and singleminded dedication to the national interests of Nigeria, <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> has been one of the most effective African diplomats over the four years he has served here. Apart from <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> himself, no Nigerian has done more to restore good relations in the post war period.</p>
                        <p>In May <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> returns to Lagos to become Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, the top career official in the Nigerian foreign policy structure. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs new position will broaden his influence and bring it to bear on almost every foreign policy decision of the Federal Military Government. The possibility of Gowonʼs making a State Visit here next year, our access to leaders in Lagos, and the increasing scale of US private investment in Nigeria are all matters on which Iyalla will be giving key advice. Your receiving Iyalla for a farewell call would be a gesture of respect toward <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>, would underline the importance of Nigeria in our African policy, and would further cordial relations with the Federal Military Government in the future.</p>

                        <p>Stateʼs memo at Tab A flags for you the fact that weʼre having difficulties these days with sub-Saharan Africaʼs largest country, Nigeria. Obstacles have been thrown up to our desires to establish a Regional Trade Center, to open another consulate, and to revive an investment guarantee program. The tone various Nigerian officials are taking with our people is also troublesome.</p>
                        <p>Two things have happened-- First, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> is personally unhappy that the U.S. has resumed imports of Rhodesian chrome in violation of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> sanctions, an unhappiness apparently shared by other key officials. Second, former Ambassador to the U.S. Joe Iyalla has become number two man in the Foreign Ministry. Always a prickly customer with us, <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName>ʼs feelings were hurt because President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would not receive him for a farewell call last April (our Schedule Proposal was turned down).</p>
                        <p>We are not the only ones with headaches in Nigeria. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is under fire for failure to oust the white government in Rhodesia and France is still disliked because of the assistance it gave to Biafra. One probable result of <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs displeasure with the West is his decision to make his first state visit out of Africa to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. At this stage, thereʼs not much for us to do about this state of affairs, except watch it.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Although there is no crisis in our relations, you should know that the Nigerian attitude toward the US has become increasingly vexatious in recent weeks. We are beginning to encounter opposition over the Department of Commerceʼs plan to establish a Regional Trade Development Center in Lagos despite earlier indications that the center would be welcomed. Similar hostility is surfacing regarding our efforts to open a consulate in the oil center of Port Harcourt and to revive the OPIC investment guarantee program. While we continue to encounter a number of petty annoyances on such administrative matters as visas and our Embassy leases, at least some elements of Nigerian officialdom now seem intent on raising obstacles to our longer range commercial and investment goals as well. If nothing else, the abrasive tone that is creeping into their handling of our requests is a matter for concern.</p>
                        <p>Until recently at least the self assertive and nationalistic mood that has prevailed in Lagos since the end of the war has not had an anti-US thrust nor prevented useful exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs regime. The present hardening of the Nigeriansʼ attitude has been a definite setback in our improving relations. It seems to stem in some measure from bitterness over U.S. resumption of Rhodesian chrome imports. In a very emotional demarche last April, General <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName> complained of our non-compliance with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> sanctions and asserted that the U.S. does not share Nigeriaʼs urgent concerns on Southern African issues. His <pb n="3" xml:id="d215-03" facs="d215-03"/>displeasure on this subject has obviously affected the rapport that our Ambassador was developing with him. In addition we have had indications that <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">Gowon</persName>ʼs views are shared by other key <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> officials, including External Affairs Commissioner Arikpo. Annoyance over the Byrd amendment was a major reason the Nigerians took the lead on the recent <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> censure of the U.S. on Namibia and apartheid.</p>
                        <p>There is a personal element as well. The former Ambassador in Washington, Joe Iyalla, is now Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs. He still harbors resentments from the difficulties he experienced here during the critical days of the civil war. On top of this he was offended that he could not see the President for a farewell call prior to his departure last April. Assisted by a deputy long known for his antagonism to the U.S., <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">Iyalla</persName> is in close touch with members of the Supreme Military Council and probably has as much influence on policy as Commissioner Arikpo. He undoubtedly influences decisions regarding the U.S.</p>
                        <p>While the situation in Lagos bears watching, it does not seem to require any special action on our part for now. Ambassador Reinhardt will be voicing some of our concerns directly when he next sees Arikpo. We may be able to mute some of our problems by frank discussions with the new Nigerian Ambassador, John Garba, when he arrives later this month. Garba comes highly praised for his reasonableness and responsiveness by U.S. officials who have worked with him over the years. When Garba does come we should do all we can to expedite the presentation of credentials. It could be an important factor in using his presence as a point of departure for providing a better tone to our relations with Nigeria.</p>

                            <item>SUMMARY: IN A LONG MEETING OCTOBER 17, MEA PERMANENT SECRETARY JOE IYALLA DETAILED A LONG LIST OF ALLEGEDLY CALCULATED AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO DOWNGRADE NIGERIA. HE COVERED THE WATERFRONT, FROM THE <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">MOJEKWU</persName> CASE TO THE JULY MURDER OF A NIGERIAN IN LOS ANGELES. IT ALL ADDS UP TO A PATTERN OF AMERICAN INDIFFERENCE AND PENCHANT TO TAKE NIGERIA FOR GRANTED. MEETING NOT UNPLEASANT AND SERVED USEFUL PURPOSE OF PERMITTING HIM TO UNLOAD. WE NEED EXPLANATIONS BUT SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO TURN THE TIDE VERY QUICKLY. MOJEKWU LIKELY TO BE GENUINE IRRITANT AS LONG AS HE REMAINS IN THE UNITED STATES. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">IYALLA</persName> QUITE CAPABLE OF TRANSFERRING HIS PASSIONATELY HELD CONVICTIONS TO OTHERS.</item>

                            <item>YESTERDAY I CONFERRED IN THE MEA WITH PERMANENT SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">IYALLA</persName> FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE HOURS AT HIS REQUEST. HE STATED THAT HE WANTED TO REVIEW THE BIDDING AND PROCEEDED TO REVEAL THAT, BY HIS RECKONING, HE HAD DEALT HIMSELF EVERY TRUMP IN THE DECK BUT HOPED THAT WE COULD HAVE A FRIENDLY GAME. INDEED, HIS THEME AND MANNER WERE MARKED BY FRIENDSHIP FOR “FRIENDS MUST REMOVE ISOLATED IRRITANTS BEFORE THEY GROW INTO ʼMALIGNANCY.ʼ”3 HE DID NOT WISH TO DWELL ON SEMANTICS, BUT REALLY “IRRITANT” WAS USED ONLY BECAUSE HE, A NATIVE IJAW SPEAKER, DID NOT HAVE THE ENGLISH NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE” <pb n="2" xml:id="d216-02" facs="d216-02"/>THE SEEMINGLY DELIBERATE AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO TAKE NLGERIA FOR GRANTED AND TO CREATE ANTI-NIGERIAN FEELING IN THE UNITED STATES.” I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS RELIEVED THAT HE ADDED “IN THE UNITED STATES” FOR I COULD CERTAINLY THINK OF NO “IRRITANTS” IN NIGERIA THAT WOULD FIT HIS PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION. HE ASSURED ME THAT BEFORE HE FINISHED HE WOULD POINT OUT A FEW IN NIGERIA, TOO, BUT THAT HIS MAIN CONCERN WAS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH NIGERIA WAS BEING IGNORED IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS SEEMED STRANGE TO ME IN THE LIGHT OF THE RECENT AMICABLE MEETING BETWEEN SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">ROGERS</persName> AND COMMISSIONER ARIKPO. HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THIS MEETING AT A HIGH LEVEL BUT WANTED TO DESCEND TO A LOWER LEVEL “WHERE THE MUNDANE MATTERS THAT REALLY CONCERN NATIONS ARE IMPORTANT.” I REPLIED THAT I NEVER LIKE TO DESCEND BUT THAT HIS INITIAL SPARRING WAS LIKE THE PENULTIMATE CHAPTER IN A BOOK OF FICTION AND THAT I COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THE DENOUEMENT. HE SMILED AND PROMISED “TO MOVE TO REALITY,” INTO WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED.</item>

                            <item>FIRST, THERE IS THE MOJEKWU MATTER. THIS IS AN OLD STORY, HE KNEW, BUT IT IS RESURFACING, “EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” BECAUSE THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> NOW HAS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE THAT <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">MOJEKWU</persName> IS INFLUENCING INDIVIDUAL IBOS IN THE US, AT A TIME WHEN THE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> THOUGHT THAT THESE EX-REBELS HAD BECOME RECONCILED. <persName corresp="#p_MCC1">MOJEKWU</persName> OUTSMARTS US AUTHORITIES BY NOT AGITATING PUBLICLY, BUT THE DAMAGE IS JUST AS GREAT. OUR “UNNECESSARY DECISION” TO ADMIT HIM WAS BAD ENOUGH, ESPECIALLY SINCE BY DOING SO WE HAD REJECTED A SPECIAL REQUEST FROM THE HEAD OF STATE, BUT UNLESS HE HAS LEFT WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE COMPOUNDED OUR “ORIGINAL SIN” BY OUTRIGHT RENEGING ON A PROMISE TO EXPEL HIM ONE YEAR FROM FEBRUARY, 1971, WHEN THE VISA WAS GRANTED. HE REALIZED THAT WE CITED JUNE, 1971, AT THE DATE OF ENTRY, BUT THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF GRANTING THE VISA WAS FEBRUARY. STILL EVEN IF HE ACCEPTS OUR DATE WE HAVE FAILED TO EXPEL HIM. WHY? THIS MAN WAS LIVING IN COMFORT IN PORTUGAL, OUR ENEMY, BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT HE IS PERMITTED TO DWELL AMONG ASSUMED FRIENDS IN THE US. HE ASSURED ME THAT “THIS TRAVESTY OF AMERICAN CONCERN FOR AN INNOCENT VISA APPLICANT” WAS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE ISLAND CLUB BY ORDINARY NIGERIANS BUT ALSO IN DODAN BARRACKS.</item>

                            <item>HE PLEADED THAT I NOT RESPOND TO HIS INDIVIDUAL EXAMPLES BUT THAT I SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON “THE WHOLE PATTERN OF <pb n="3" xml:id="d216-03" facs="d216-03"/>AMERICAN INDIFFERENCE.” THUS, HE APOLOGIZED FOR MOVING ON TO POINT TWO, “WHICH IS THE MATTER OF COMMISSIONER DIKKOʼS SHABBY TREATMENT AT DULLES AIRPORT, THE SCENE OF INNUMERABLE INDIGNITIES TO HIGH LEVEL NIGERIAN VISITORS, TO MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.” NOW, COMMISSIONER DIKKO IS A SAINTLY, GENTLE MAN WHO HAS A REPUTATION FOR NEVER COMPLAINING, BUT EVEN HE “THOUGHT THIS” DOWNRIGHT SHABBY TREATMENT, I MUST TELL YOU TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.” I APOLOGIZED FOR BREAKING HIS GROUND RULE, BUT OBSERVED THAT I HAD TALKED WITH THE COMMISIONER AT LEAST TWICE IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN FROM WASHINGTON AND HAD RECEIVED NOTHING BUT EXPRESSION OF UNLIMITED PRAISE. “OH, YOU MUST REALIZE THAT THE COMMISSIONER IS SO KIND. HE WOULD NEVER TELL YOU, BUT HE CERTAINLY TOLD US, INCLUDING GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_GGYJ1">GOWON</persName>, WHO WAS DISMAYED AND WAS VERGING ON ORDERING SIMILAR TREATMENT FOR AMERICAN AT IKEJA UNTIL I INTERVENED.” I PERSISTED THAT OBVIOUSLY RETALIATION WITHOUT OFFERING ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR CORRECTING ALLEGED WRONGS WOULD HAVE BEEN, “TO USE YOUR FAVORITE WORD, A NIGERIAN TRAVESTY.” FURTHER, DIKKO TRAVELED IN MAY, AND YOU HAVE WAITED SIX MONTHS BEFORE MENTIONING THE PROBLEM AND EVEN NOW GENERALIZE ABOUT “ SHABBY TREATMENT,” WHICH IS UNCORRECTABLE BECAUSE UNDEFINABLE. HE COULD BE SPECIFIC: POOR, OLD MAN MADE TO CARRY HIS OWN BAGS BECAUSE NIGERIAN EMBASSY PERSONNEL COULD NOT REACH HIM “BEYOND YOUR BARRIERS,” AND REPEATEDLY “MADE TO QUEUE UP LIKE ALL ORDINARY PASSENGERS.”</item>

                            <item>THEN THERE IS THE CASE OF NAZIF MOHAMMED, A DULY ACCREDITED MEMBER OF THE NIGERIAN EMBASSY STAFF IN WASHINGTON, A RECOGNIZED DIPLOMAT, WHO IN JULY, 1972, WAS “MANHANDLED BY THE WASHINGTON <pb n="4" xml:id="d216-04" facs="d216-04"/>POLICE.” HE REALIZES THAT INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS CAN GET OUT OF HAND, “ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE LIKE WASHINGTON.” WHAT PUZZLES HIM “AND OTHER AT THE HIGEST LEVEL” IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE WILL NOT EVEN ANSWER OUR FORMAL PROTESTS, MADE ORALLY AND SUBMITTED IN WRITING ON AUGUST 2, 1972. “TODAY IS OCTOBER 17, AND WE STILL AWAIT AN ANSWER.” HE GAVE ME A COPY OF HIS EMBASSYʼS NOTE WITH “REFERENCE NO. DXI/1,” WHICH DOES DETAIL A STIFF PROTEST.</item>

                            <item>STILL WORSE, IN <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">IYALLA</persName>ʼS OPINION BUT “NOT IF THAT OF SOME OF MY HIGH-LEVEL COLLEAGUES, WHO WILL NEVER GET OVER THE MOJEKWU MATTER,” IS THE CASE OF MRS. LILY SMITH, AN AMERICAN LADY WHO PICKETED OUR EMBASSY “FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS,” SPLASHED OUR WALL WITH RED PAINT, AND PAINTED “SCURRILOUS, ANTI-NIGERIAN REMARKS ON OUR OWN PROPERTY.” MRS. SMITH SEEMED TO THE EMBASSY STAFF TO BE DEMENTED AND SHOULD BE PITIED AND FORGIVEN. WHAT HE CAN NOT FORGIVE IS THE “TOTAL FAILURE OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE, THE EXECUTIVE PROTECTIVE AGENCY, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE TO ANSWER OUR DESPERATE PLEAS FOR PERIOD OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE WOULD ANSWER YOUR PLEAS AT YOUR EMBASSY HERE, FOR WE RECOGNIZE IT AS OUR DUTY TO PROTECT FOREIGN ESTABLISHMENTS.”</item>

                            <item>THE PATTERN OF INDIFFERENCE CONTINUES TO UNFOLD, HE OBSERVED, FOR ALSO IN JULY, 1972, ONE DR. ADIGUN, A DECENT, UPSTANDING NIGERIAN CITIZEN, WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD AND IN VERY SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IN LOS ANGELES. FOR A LONG PERIOD THE NIGERIAN EMBASSY WAS NOT EVEN NOTIFIED. USING ITS OWN MEANS, THE EMBASSY FINALLY LEARNED OF THIS DESPICABLE ACT, PROTESTED TO THE DEPARTMENT, AND WAS ROUTINELY PROMISED AN INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT, “WHICH IS NOT THE WAY ONE TREATS FRIENDS.” DR. ADIGUN IS WELL CONNECTED IN NIGERIA, AND HIS FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE “PROTESTED TO THE HIGEST LEVEL... I MUST TELL YOU THESE THINGS ARE DISCUSSED AT THE ISLAND CLUB AND (UNDERLINE AND) AT DODAN BARRAKS.”</item>

                            <item>HE COULD REPEAT “NUMEROUS OTHER EXAMPLES THAT FORM A PATTERN, A PATTERN OF SOMETHING CLOSE TO CONTEMPT FOR NIGERIAN.” BUT HE WANTED TO RUSH ON TO A FEW PROBLEMS HERE IN NIGERIA. FOREMOST THE “MOST SERIOUS IS THE JURA CASE (REPORTED IN SEPTEL).</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>THE PERMANENT SECRETARY IS ALSO DISTURBED ABOUT “FREEDOM OF THE PRESS SEMINARS CONDUCTED BY YOUR UISIS PEOPLE HERE.” HE DOUBTED THAT THERE IS ANY PROBLEM BUT HAD RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS FROM “PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED.” ALL HE WANTED NOW WAS FOR “YOUR PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER WITH MY PEOPLE. LET US UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DO, AND WE WILL EXPLAIN THE TOLERABLE LIMITS OF SUCH SEMINARS.”</item>

                            <item>THEN, THERE IS THE CASE OF A RECENT VISIT BY A HIGH-LEVEL EVEN DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN POLITICO-BUSINESS GROUP, WHO CAME HERE AND IN “TYPICAL AMERICAN FASHION” WANTED TO RUSH IN AND TALK WITH THE HEAD OF STATE AND SEAL A DEAL ON THE SPOT. “I THINK WE GOT THEM STRAIGHT, AND THEY NOW REALIZE THAT NIGERIA IS NOT ONE OF YOUR BANANA REPUBLICS.” I ASKED WHETHER HE THOUGHT THE USG WAS REPONSIBLE FOR THE GAFFES OF EVERY VISITOR. NO, HE DID NOT, AND ONLY CITED THIS VISIT AS AN EXAMPLE OF “HOW AMERICANS TAKE NIGERIA FOR GRANTED AND DOWGRADE US WHENEVER THEY CAN.” (CF/ MY LETTER TO FOLEY DATE SEPTEMBER 17.)</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>FINALLY, HE REALIZED THAT THE PROPER PLACE FOR DICUSSING <pb n="6" xml:id="d216-06" facs="d216-06"/>MOST OF THES PROBLEMS IS WASHINGTON, WHICH HIS EMBASSY HAD DONE TO NO AVAIL. HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THESE “AFFRONTS” IN ISOLATION, WHAT HE WANTED ME TO UNDERSTAND IS “THE PATTERN, THE CALCULATED TREND OF DOWNGRADING NIGERIA.” I SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT “THIS PATTERN, THIS TREND” IS NOT NEW: HE HAD WATCHED IT DEVELOP AND BECOME WELL ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT HIS TOUR IN WASHINGTON. THE BIG DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT OTHER <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> OFFICIALS, “EVEN POOR DR. DIKKO,” ARE BECOMING CONVINCED OF “A PATTERN, A TREND,” WHICH IYALLA NEVER DOUBTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. A FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES, THE PERMANENT SECRETARY WISHED “TO ARREST THE GROWTH OF THIS MALIGNANCY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE FOR BOTH OF OUR COUNTRIES.”</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>IN MY RESPONSE, I BEGAN BY EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR HIS FINALLY BRINGING TO MY ATTENTION MATTERS THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN DISTURBING HIM FOR A LONG PERIOD. INDEED, I WONDERED WHY HE HAD WAITED SO LONG, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAD TALKED WITH HIM MANY TIMES SINCE HCP RETURN IN MAY. HE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY REORGANIZING THE MINISTRY, HE SAID, BUT MORE IMPORTANT HE WANTED TO “COLLECT THE ELEMENTS OF LIE PATTERN.” I TOLD HIM THAT IN MY JUDGMENT IT WAS LITTLE SHORT OF “NONSENSE” TO TALK <pb n="7" xml:id="d216-07" facs="d216-07"/>ABOUT “YOUR PATTERNS AND TRENDS.” I WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT CONSIDERABLE MISUNDERSTANDING HAD ARISEN FOR REASONS THAT I WOULD NOT EXPLAIN BUT THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT HIS EXTENDED STAY IN THE UNITED STATES HAD NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE NO CULTURAL GROUNDS FOR “YOUR PATTERNS”: WE ARE MUCH TOO DIRECT TO BUILD THE KIND OF PATTERNS THAT YOUR ARE SEEING. “FRANKLY,” I SAID, “YOUR CASE WOULD BE FAR MORE CONVINCING IF YOU WERE CHARGING IMPETUOUS ACTIONS RATHER THAN STUDIED, DELIBERATE, PARANOIA-LADEN LITTLE INSULTS.” TO ASSIGN PLAUSIBILITY TO HIS ARGUMENT, ONE WOULD NEED TO “SEE LITTLE MEN IN DARK CORNERS STUDYING WAYS TO INSULT NIGERIA” ANY AMBASSADOR WHO HAD STAYED IN WASHINGTON AS LONG AS HE SHOULD KNOW THAT TO MOVE FROM DIKKO TO LILY SMITH TO A LOS ANGELES MURDER IN A PATTERN CALLED FOR INGENUITY FAR BETTER EMPLOYED IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLICY AND MILITARY PROBLEMS GREATER THAN ANY NIGERIA HAD PRESENTED DURING THE PERIOD HE HAD DISCUSSED. I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BEFORE THIS MEETING I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE DIKKO CASE, OF LILY SMITH, AND NAZIF MOHAMMED. WHILE HIS BEST CHANNEL FOR QUICK CORRECTION OF OBVIOUS MISUNDERSTANDING IS HIS EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON, I WOULD REPORT HIS VIEWS AND SEEK A RESPONSE. I, OF COURSE, KNEW OF THE MOJEKWU PROBLEM BUT WAS UNWILLING TO SPECULATE BEYOND THE INFORMATION CONVEYED BY <pb n="8" xml:id="d216-08" facs="d216-08"/>MR. FOLEY IN MAY, 1972. I REGRETTED THE TRAGIC DEATH OF DR. ADIGUN AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH HIS EMBASSY REQUEST FOR AN INVESTIGATION, THE RESULTS OF WHICH I WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD SOON HAVE. (HE THOUGHT THAT “SOON” WOULD NOT COVER THE ELAPSE OF TIME SINCE JULY, AND HE MAY BE USING ONE OF HIS TRUMPS QUITE WELL WITH THIS RETORT.) AS FOR THE USIS SEMINARS, HIS REPORTS ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF MINE, FOR WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO CONDUCT FAR MORE THAN WE CAN ARRANGE. I AGREED THAT SOME VISITING AMERICANS EXHIBIT TACTLESSNESS BUT ARGUED THAT THEIR REGRETTABLE CLUMSINESS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH HIS “PATTERNS.”</item>

                            <item>COMMENT: SUCH ARE THE PEREGRINATIONS OF A FRIEND DETERMINED, AS HE PUT IT, TO HELP AMERICA HELP HERSELF. HOWEVER, <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">IYALLA</persName> TODAY WAS NEITHER AN IRASCIBLE B.A. CLARK NOR AN UNINFORMED LARRY FEBUNMI. PRESENT IN HIS MANNER WAS THE USUAL FEIGNED REGRET TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS AND THE EQUALLY FEIGNED DESIRE TO BE REASONABLE IN PURSUIT OF A MUTUAL GOAL. HOWEVER, HE WAS NOT DISAGREEABLE. HE SEEMED GENUINELY CERTAIN THAT HE WAS PRESENTING CAREFULLY SELECTED EXAMPLES THAT CAN NOT BE SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED. THUS, HE HAS HEARD OUR MOJEKWU EXPLANATIONS BUT REJECTS THEM BEFORE WE SPEAK, THOUGH THIS TIME HE ADDS “EVIDENCE” THE THE FORMER BIAFRAN IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT IYALLA SAID WOULD HAPPEN AND WE ASSURED HIM WOULD NEVER BE TOLERATED. I AM CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING WENT WRONG DURING THE DIKKO STORY. DIKKO IS FAR FROM THE SAINT THAT <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">IYALLA</persName> PORTRAYS, BUT HE IS A MILD MAN WHO APPARENTLY HAS CREATED QUITE A RUMPUS HERE. <persName corresp="#p_IJTF1">IYALLA</persName> MULTIPLIES DIKKOʼS EXPERIENCE SEVERAL FOLD, ASSURING THAT IT ESCALATES BEYOND THE IRRITANT LEVEL.</item>

                            <item>THE REFERENCE TO THE SEMINARS IS PRETTY CLEAR. WHILE TALKS BEFORE THE PRESS HAVE NOT EMPHASIZED PRESS FREEDOM, HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE CAN BE NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT. YET HE CHOSE NOT TO MAKE HIS POINT TODAY AND BELIEVES THAT BY INDIRECTIONS HE CAN HAVE OTHER ACHIEVE THIS END.</item>

THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT TODAYʼS REGURGITATION LEAVES HIM EMPTY, BUT ITʼS GOOD TO HAVE WHAT I OBTAINED. CLEARLY WE WILL NEED SOME ANSWERS TO WHAT I GOT TODAY. THE ONE THAT WILL HELP MOST IS RESPONSIVENESS TO THE MOJEKWU CASE. I KNOW ALL OF THE DIFFICULTIES PREVIOUSLY CITED, BUT WE ARE WASTING OUR TIME REPEATING THEM TO THE NIGERIANS. AS LONG AS MOJEKWU STAYS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL HAVE A GENUINE “IRRITANT” ON OUR HANDS.</item>

                            <item>IN LEAVING IYALLA, I URGED THAT HE NOT WAIT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BEFORE UNLOADING; HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NOT. I VAINLY TRIED TO SUMMARIZE THE MEETING BY ORSERVING THAT IN TENNESSEE WE WOULD CHARACTERIZE HIS COMPLAINTS, AT BEST, AS “MISUNDERSTANDINGS” OR “ABERRATIONS.” HE WOULD HAVE NONE OF THAT, NOTING THAT IJAW IS NOT NEARLY AS RICH AS TENNESSEE ENGLISH BUT THAT IN HIS LANGUAGE THEY HAVE A WORD THAT CAN BE ROUGHLY TRANSLATED AS “SHAFTING.” SHINING THROUGH HIS WIT IS FAIRLY ACCURATE SUMMARY OF THIS WHOLE DEMARCHE: HE SINCERELY BELIEVES HIS “SHAFTING” AND “PATTERNS” THESIS, AND UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVINCING OTHERS, “AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” AS HE FONDLY REITERATES.<lb/>GDS</item>

                        <p>1. FIVE DAY VISIT NIGERIA, INCLUDING THREE STATES IN EAST, REINFORCES IMPRESSION OF FIERCELY INDEPENDENT, SENSITIVE BLACK NATION THAT WILL CONTINUE ATTRACT, FRUSTRATE, AND MAKE USE OF THOSE FROM BOTH EAST AND WEST KNOCKING AT ITS DOOR. US REMAINS POPULAR BUT SUFFERS AT HIGHEST LEVELS <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> FROM OUR CIVIL WAR POLICY, OUR STANDS ON SOUTHERN AFRICA AND NIGERIAN FEELING WE ARE UNWILLING RESPOND THEIR PRIORITIES ON <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTEDLY NEARLY ALL CONVERSATIONS I HAVE HAD WITH OPFICIAL NIGERIANS IN LAGOS AND PARTICULARLY IN THREE EASTERN STATES HAVE CONCERNED US ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. WHILE NO ACTION WE TAKE NOR ANY OTHER NATION TAKES IN ASSISTANCE FIELD LIKELY YIELD ANY PRONOUNCED POLITICAL OR POLICY BENEFITS, THERE SEEMS LITTLE DOUBT OUR ASSISTANCE ROLE WILL CONTINUE BE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN NIGERIAN ATTITUDE TOWARD US.</p>
                        <p>3. PROBLEM IS DIFFICULT ONE FOR US. IN COMPARISON RESOURCES MANY OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, NIGERIA IS RICH, YET IT IS <pb n="2" xml:id="d217-02" facs="d217-02"/>OBVIOUS TO TRAVELER ITS NEEDS ARE GREAT AND NEW OIL REVENUES WILL NOT FOR LONG TIME MATCH NEEDS. COTERIE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONERS WANT “MASSIVE” CAPITAL PROJECT ASSISTANCE PROM US. THEY HAVE LITTLE TIME, PATIENCE OR STAFF FOR MODEST PROPOSALS AND HAVE TOTALLY UNREALISTIC IDEA US CAPACITY TO PROVIDE. THEY SO FAR HAVE TURNED LARGELY DEAF EAR TO US SECTOR LOAN AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS, ALTHOUGH ONE FINDS INTEREST AND DESIRE SUCH ASSISTANCE AMONG SOME FEDERAL COMMISSIONERS IN FUNCTIONAL FIELD SUCH AS AGRICULTURE AND CERTAINLY AMONG STATE GOVERNMENTS. WE FOUND IN ALL THREE STATES EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR PAST AND PRESENT AID BUT ACCOMPANIED BY IMPRESSION, APPARENTLY EMANATING FROM LAGOS, THAT US NO LONGER WILLING HELP NIGERIA BECAUSE “NIGERIA RICH.” IN LAGOS, HOWEVER, CENTRAL PROBLEM IS THAT LOAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS AT HEART NEW AID STRATEGY IS VERY ELEMENT KEY COMMISSIONERS MOST STRONGLY OPPOSE. THEY FEEL THEY WOULD IN EFFECT BE PAYING HIGH COST US TECHNICIANS WHEN CHEAPER ONES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. EMBASSYʼS A-262 IS EXCELLENT REVIEW CURRENT PROBLEM.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> HAS MADE GENUINE AND IMAGINATIVE EFFORT THROUGH PROPOSALS MADE LAST DECEMBER FOR BLOCK GRANT, PROJECT DEVELOPMENT LOAN AND SECTOR LOAN. NIGERIANS WILL, WITHOUT MUCH GRACE, ACCEPT BLOCK GRANT AS THEY WILL PROBABLY ACCEPT ANY GRANT OFFER.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> CLEARLY PREPARED MAKE SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT. FIVE <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> TEAMS WERE REPORTEDLY TO BE IN NIGERIA LAST WEEDK. YET IT IS DIFFICULT GET HARD INFORMATION ON BANKʼS INTENTIONS. BOTH BANK TEAMS AND NIGERIANS RELUCTANT EXCHANGE SPECIFICS. WE SHOULD SEEK GREATER EXCHANGE IN WASHINGTON. FOR EXAMPLE, IBRD PLANNING CONSTRUCT 15 COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THREE EASTERN STATES, YET IN CONTACTS AND CONSULTATIONS THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE DETAILED EXCHANGE WITH AID PERSONNEL WHO HAVE FOR PAST THREE YEARS BEEN ORGANIZING SUCH SCHOOL IN PORT HARCOURT.</p>
                        <p>6. IN ABSENCE ANY NIGERIAN ACCEPTANCE RE US <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,WE WILL, WITHIN NEXT FEW YEARS NO LONGER BE SIGNIFICANT DONOR. WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE US CITIZENS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS TWA CONTRACT, BUT USG WILL RECEIVE LITTLE CREDIT. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN FINAL PHASES IMPLEMENTATION 1971 RECONSTRUCTION LOAN AND <pb n="3" xml:id="d217-03" facs="d217-03"/>1971 PROGRAM LOAN. TWO PROJECTS REMAIN TO BE STARTED FROM EARLIER LOANS CURRENT GRANT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECTS IN AGRICULTURE NOT LIKELY BE FUNDED BEYOND FY 1973. ONLY CURRENT POSSIBILITIES FOR FUTURE REPRESENTED BY PROPOSALS FOR BLOCK GRANT, LOAN FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND SECTOR LOAN. NIGERIANS EXPECTED APPROVE BLOCK GRANT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT AT PRESENT THERE SEEMS LITTLE PROSPECT THEY WILL ACCEPT OTHERS. AID ENCOURAGED BY TALKS WITH PERMANENT SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE TO RELIEVE <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> MAY BE INTERESTED IN PILOT FOOD PRODUCTION PROJECT POSSIBLY LEADING TO MAJOR SECTOR LOAN. EMBASSY MORE SKEPTICAL ABOUT PERMSECʼS ABILITY TO SELL IDEA TO <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss>. I HEARD NOTHING FROM FEW <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> OFFICIALS I SAW IN LAGOS TO ENCOURAGE BELIEF THEY WILL ACCEPT SUCH PROPOSAL FROM US IN THEIR CURRENT MOOD. NEVERTHELESS STATE OFFICIALS WITH WHOM WE TALKED EXPRESSES INTEREST AND CONCEIVABLY MORE ENERGETIC ONES COULD PRESS IDEA WITH LAGOS. INDICATIVE OF PROBLEM WAS COMMENT TO ME BY SECRETARY TO <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> THAT US BY EMPHASIZING AGRICULTURE OVER CAPITALʼPROJFCTS SEEKʼIG TO “TURN CLOCK BACK” IN NIGERIA.</p>
                        <p>7. CONCLUSIONS: MY CONCLUSION FROM MOST INFORMATIVE TRIP ARE THAT:</p>
                        <p>A. WE SHOULD CONTINUE TRY TO PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN NIGERIAN DEVELOPMENT FOR NEXT FEW YEARS. THERE ARE COMPELLING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL REASONS FOR DOING SO.</p>
                        <p>B. WE SHOULD STAND BY OUR POSITION THAT WE CANNOT PROVIDE LARGE CAPITAL PROJECT AID. I DO NOT BELIEVE WE COULD JUSTIFY THIS WITH CONGRESS OR IN TERMS OUR OTHER REQUIREMENT IN AFRICA. WE SHOULD REMAIN PREPARED TO DISCUSS SMALLER PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE SPECIAL CAPABILITIES.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d217-04" facs="d217-04"/>
                        <p>C. WE SHOULD CONTINUE MAKE CLEAR OUR WILLINGNESS HELP THROUGH EFFORTS IN LAGOS AND IN PARTICULAR BY CONTINUING APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS. EVEN IF <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> DOES NOT ACCEPT PROPOSALS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE CLEAR OUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS.</p>
                        <p>D. WE SHOULD SEEK CLOSER TOUCH IN WASHINGTON WITH IBRD TO INSURE WE HAVE CONTINUING BENEFIT THEIR ORSERVATIONS AND PLANS.</p>
                        <p>E. WE SHOULD ARRANGE THOROUGHGOING REVIEW OUR NIGERIAN AID OPTIONS WITH AMBASSADOR REINHARDT WHO WILL BE IN WASHINGTON EARLY JANUARY.<lb/>GDS</p>

                        <p>4. Burundi Political Crisis - The Burundi Government has been under attack from insurgents supported by outside forces who may have entered the country from Tanzania or Zaire and joined with local tribesmen.</p>
                        <p>President Micombero remains in command of the Government and the army, but his forces have not been able to regain complete control of parts of the Bururi Province in southern Burundi where some fighting continues, hundreds of people reportedly have been killed and large areas devastated.</p>
                        <p>There are no reports of Americans or Europeans having been harmed in any of the violence. Our Embassy has advised the 125 Americans, mainly missionaries, residing in Burundi to exercise extreme prudence and remain close to their missions since there were rumors of American involvement stemming from missionary contacts with tribesmen.</p>
                        <p>In response to Micomberoʼs request for international assistance for the refugees, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Melady</persName> has offered foodstuffs from Catholic Relief Service supplies stored in Bujumbura and plans to make additional purchases utilizing disaster relief funds.</p>

                            <item>Burundi: <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> Criticizes Administration</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> has used the tragedy in Burundi to accuse the Administration of suppressing information on events there. In a statement reported in Sundayʼs New York Times, <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> claims that State said things were quiet in Burundi when they were not. State officials deny that they said any such thing. <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>ʼs aides have also given the Times leaked cables from our Embassy in Burundi which present some grisly details, but do not seem to provide ammunition for charges embarrassing to the Administration.</p>
                        <p>We have been in something of a dilemma over what to do about Burundi. On the one hand, the slaughter is systematic and extensive, probably involving upwards of 100,000 victims. There are strong humanitarian reasons for trying to halt it, as well as the prospect of increasing political criticism -- like <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>ʼs -- if we donʼt act. On the other hand, thereʼs not much we can do realistically. Our leverage in the country is miniscule. We could contemplate a public statement denouncing events, but this would have little or no positive effect in Burundi, except to subject our Embassy to official wrath -- perhaps including closure of the Mission -- and would result in African accusations that we are meddling in their affairs. For these reasons, a public statement would be contrary to our policy of avoiding quixotic moral posturing.</p>
                        <p>Within these narrow limits, however, we have not been indifferent to the situation, as the record shows. At the outset, our Ambassador to Burundi expressed our readiness to give humanitarian assistance. We were, in fact, the first to do so and have, so far, disbursed $72,000 for food, medicine, blankets, clothing and ambulances. On the diplomatic front, our Ambassadors to Zaire, Ethiopia and Rwanda briefed those governments on events in Burundi in the hope that neighboring or influential <pb n="2" xml:id="d220-02" facs="d220-02"/>African countries would take the lead. We also raised the issue with the Organization of African Unity, which, however, has shown itself steadfastly uninterested, in keeping with the consistent <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> position that tribal problems are strictly the internal affair of the country where they occur. In addition, on May 30, we supported a diplomatic initiative in Burundi led by the Papal Nuncio, with which the Belgians, West Germans, Swiss, British, Dutch and Zairians also associated themselves. None of the foregoing has helped visibly. More international expressions of concern with the issue could result from a United Nations relief mission now touring Burundi.</p>
                        <p>I call these facts to your attention because the dimensions of this continuing atrocity may break more sharply into the public view than has thus far been the case.</p>

                            <item>Burundi - population 3.5 million</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As had happened often in the past, on April 29 a group of Hutus tried to precipitate a revolt against the ruling Tutsi tribe. The revolt failed but touched off a bloody reprisal that led to possibly over 100,000 Hutu deaths, and to nearly a half-million Hutu widows and orphans.</p>
                        <p>Tribalism was at the root of the Burundi warfare. The Hutus, who rep-resent 85% of the population, wanted to overthrow the tall Tutsi (Watusis) who make up 15% of the people. The Hutu rebels killed every Tutsi that they ran across during their initial rampage which triggered the Tutsi decision to exterminate all Hutus with any semblance of leadership, i. e., those who could read or write, or those who wore shoes. Sixty thousand Hutus fled the country.</p>
                        <p>The Burundi tragedy appears to have been a strictly internal, tribal matter. Except for Zaire, which at first assisted the Burundi Government because it believed the invading rebels were connected with former Congolese dissidents, there was no African intervention. In fact, no African leader spoke out publicly against the massacres nor sought to involve the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or the Organization of African Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The United States, for humanitarian reasons and due to some Congressional concern (Senators <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> and Tunney), tried to interest the Africans in taking the matter to the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. Only <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> contemplated such action. Leaders such as Selassie, Ahidjo and Nyerere did not want to intervene in Burundiʼs internal affairs. We also urged the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to establish a humanitarian presence hoping that this would lead to an end to the repression. Such a presence came too late.</p>
                        <p>Burundiʼs former colonial master, Belgium, publicly denounced the Burundi genocide, stopped military aid and slowed down their economic assistance. This had little effect on the Tutsi Government. Other Europeans, particularly the French, maintained a hands-off posture.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d222-02" facs="d222-02"/>
                        <p>There is no evidence that the PRC or <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have played any role in Burundi, or that they seek to profit from the situation.</p>
                        <p>The outlook for the future seems bleak. Reconciliation between the Hutus and Tutsis seems impossible, and it is hard to imagine a stable situation before the majority Hutus prevail, as they have in neighboring Rwanda.</p>
                        <p>Our own interests in Burundi are microscopic (we buy some coffee). We have 150 citizens there, mostly missionaries. There has never been any threat to the safety of Europeans, whose protection the Burundi Government assured to avoid outside intervention.</p>
                        <p>It is present US policy to give humanitarian assistance to Burundi if we can assure its distribution to all the population. Otherwise, we are assisting refugees outside the country.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d222-03" facs="d222-03"/>
                        <p>K-</p>
                        <p>This is one of the most cynical, callous reactions of a great government to a terrible human tragedy I have ever seen. When Paks try to put down a rebellion in East Pakistan, the world screams. When Indians kill a few thousand Paks, no one cares. Biafra stirs us because of Catholics; the Israeli Olympics because of Jews; the North Vietnam bombings because of Communist leanings in our establishment. But when 100,000 (one-third of all the people of a black country) are murdered, we say and do nothing because we must not make blacks look bad (except, of course, when Catholic blacks are killed).</p>
                        <p>I do not buy this double standard. Tell the weak sisters in the African Bureau of State to give a recommendation as to how we can at least show moral outrage. And letʼs begin by calling back our Ambassador immediately for consultation. Under no circumstances will I appoint a new Ambassador to present credentials to these butchers.</p>

                            <item>The U.S. Response to the Burundi Tragedy</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Between April 29 and the end of July, serious ethnic violence flared in Burundi. The United States during this period, both in Burundi and outside, made strong efforts to awaken African and international concern and to encourage relief to those affected.</p>
                        <p>What Actually Happened</p>
                        <p>Elements of the majority Hutu ethnic group plotted to overthrow the minority Tutsi regime. The Hutus struck in various localities on April 29, killing several thousand Tutsis. The Tutsi army with superior firepower quickly mastered the Hutu dissidents. A wave of reprisals followed, resulting in the deaths of more than 100,000 Hutus, and approximately 60,000 Hutu refugees in neighboring Rwanda, Zaire and Tanzania. (Burundi has a population of 3.6 million.)</p>
                        <p>Some of the killing was spontaneous with Tutsis attacking their Hutu neighbors. A great deal of the killing, however, was done by the government in a calculated manner designed to eliminate present and future Hutu leadership. The Tutsis clearly gave vent to their deepest fears of being eliminated as an ethnic group. Tutsis in Burundi have long been afraid of the kind of Hutu revolt which destroyed the Tutsis of Rwanda in 1959.</p>
                        <p>One of our major concerns was the safety of 150 U.S. missionaries who chose to stay with their parishoners, most of whom were Hutus. Despite the <pb n="2" xml:id="d225-02" facs="d225-02"/>panic and the frenzy, the Tutsis were able to assure the safety of foreigners so as to minimize any basis for external involvement. In our approach to the crisis we were conscious of past Burundi suspicions against Americans. Two American Ambassadors have been asked to leave the country since independence. We were also conscious of Burundiʼs closeness to Zaire where we have major interests.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Diplomatic Response</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Through May and June, the U.S. together with other European nations and a few Africans sought means to stop the reprisals and allow relief agencies to operate without hindrance. A major obstacle to this was the attitude of the African states who, though obviously disturbed by these events, regarded them as an internal matter. They tended generally to support the position of President Micombero of Burundi who claimed the action was necessary in order to put down a Hutu revolt.</p>
                        <p>The first step was an appeal for national re-conciliation by the Western ambassadors in Burundi. The American Ambassador joined that appeal.</p>
                        <p>The next step was to persuade African leaders to exert pressure on Burundi, because Africans normally like to solve their own problems without outside interference. In the absence of African initiatives, we made special appeals to the heads of state of Zaire, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Mauritania, the latter as President of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> of Zaire and <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> of Tanzania subsequently met with President Micombero of Burundi to urge an end to the killings on the basis of humanitarian concerns, the threat to Africaʼs image, and the need to hold support on southern African questions. For the duration of this effort, we coordinated closely with the Vatican in view of the Popeʼs forthright public statements and close personal interest in the problem.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d225-03" facs="d225-03"/>
                        <p>We also discussed the problem at length with the Belgians who are the largest aid donors in Burundi. They did as much as possible to exert political and economic pressures. At our urging, they decided to stop shipping arms and ammunition which they traditionally supplied to Burundi, a former Belgian colony.</p>
                        <p>In the belief that the introduction of relief activities by international agencies would dampen human rights violations, we stimulated the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat to intervene directly. Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName> discussed the matter with the Burundi Foreign Minister at the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> summit conference in Rabat in June. We spoke directly with Bradford Morse who played a leading role in organizing a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mission to Burundi. Slowly and patiently, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> established a permanent humanitarian presence and was eventually allowed free access to all areas. The decrease in communal violence beginning in mid-July tended to follow the slow spread of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Humanitarian Response</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first week of combat generated heavy relief requirements. The Burundi Government requested international assistance, and received a great deal. The U.S. Government made $100,000 available. Other governments, notably Belgium, West Germany, Peking and Zaire, made important contributions.</p>
                        <p>As it became clear that a massive repression of Hutus was in process, international humanitarian concerns were extended to them. At this point the Burundi Government balked, insisting that all relief supplies be distributed only in Tutsi-occupied areas. Relief requirements and human rights questions thereby became intertwined.</p>
                        <p>The violence also generated refugees in neighboring countries. Working with voluntary agencies, we made $50,000 in resources available to this group. At our <pb n="4" xml:id="d225-04" facs="d225-04"/>urging, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commission for Refugees, the host governments, and other Western countries assured a rapid and good supply of relief to the Hutu exiles, a process which is still going on.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The U.S. Role</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In summation, the U.S. role was one of active quiet leadership of an international effort, handicapped by our history of difficulties with Burundi, African attitudes, and the reluctance of most European governments to get out in front.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Consultation</hi>

                        </list>
                        <p>You asked what the Belgian reaction was to the upheaveal in Burundi. As a result of our contacts with the Belgian Government on this matter, we find that:</p>
                        <p>-- Belgian public opinion and the Belgian Parliament have been critical of continued assistance to Burundi as a result of the mass killing, causing Foreign Minister Harmel to inform the Parliament that Belgium “will have to adjust its cooperation.”</p>
                        <p>-- Belgium, largely due to domestic pressure but also at U.S. and other foreign urging, stopped its flow of ammunition to Burundi. In July, the Government of Belgium told Burundi that formal bilateral teaching agreements would be required that would give Belgium the right to replace teachers and shift personnel as it requires and give the Belgian Ambassador the right to visit teachers throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>-- Without agreement on these issues, the Belgin teaching mission would have to be recalled. Burundi will not agree to these seemingly modest requirements, believing that agreement will involve a loss of face.</p>
                        <p>-- The Belgians also informed Burundi that the members of the Belgian military assistance team would have to be called back from their outlying posts and regrouped as a single unit which would have training as its sole purpose. This, too, has produced a negative reaction.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations are still going on. However, on September 22, Foreign Minister Harmel privately informed our Ambassador to Brussels that Belgium has decided to withdraw the military assistance team and that the teacher program might be terminated.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>My earlier memoranda for you on Burundi provided background on the tribal slaughter which took place there and Belgiumʼs reaction. On my September 29 memorandum, you asked what we have done (Tab 2).</p>
                        <p>State has now recalled Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YRL1">Robert Yost</persName> for consultations and will be reviewing our future policy with him.</p>
                        <p>State also outlined their response to the Burundi tragedy in the paper at Tab 1. In summary:</p>
                        <p>State notes that between April 29 and the end of July, the United States “made strong efforts to awaken African and international concern and to encourage relief to those affected.”</p>
                        <p>-- The US participated in an appeal to the President of Burundi by Western ambassadors [France abstained] for national reconciliation;</p>
                        <p>-- The US appealed to Zaire, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Rwanda, and the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> to urge the Burundians to end the killings. [Except for Zaire, the Africans were reluctant to get involved.];</p>
                        <p>-- At our urging, Belgium stopped the shipment of arms to Burundi, a former colony;</p>
                        <p>-- We stimulated the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to establish a presence in Burundi;</p>
                        <p>-- The first week of fighting we made $100,000 available for humanitarian relief to the Burundi Government;</p>
                        <p>-- We contributed $50,000 for the care of refugees in neighboring countries.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d227-02" facs="d227-02"/>
                        <p>“In summation, “ Stateʼs paper says, “The US role was one of active quiet leadership of an international effort, handicapped by our history of difficulties with Burundi [where two of our ambassadors had previously been expelled], African attitudes, and the reluctance of most European governments to get out in front.”</p>
                        <p>Future Policy</p>
                        <p>At this point, I would not propose altering our minimal relationship with Burundi. However, I think that we should inform State and our Ambassador to Burundi that so long as the present Burundi Government remains in power, we wish our relationship to remain minimal; i.e., no bilateral aid, no self-help funds, no cultural exchange programs. This would not preclude our giving humanitarian assistance, assuming it could reach all segments of Burundiʼs population.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
                        <p>That I be authorized to inform the Department of State and Ambassador Yost that as long as the present Burundi Government remains in power, we expect our official relations with that state to be minimal. This would not preclude international humanitarian assistance providing it reaches all segments of the population but it would preclude bilateral aid, cultural exchange funds, self-help funds and similar programs.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you recommended in your memorandum at Tab 2, the President agreed that relations with Burundi should be minimal but he added: “K - also see the Burundi Ambassador.” The purpose of this memorandum is to get those instructions conveyed to State either orally, as we would suggest, or in written form as provided for in Tab 1.</p>
                        <p>In addition to informing State about our minimal relationship, the Department would be asked to call in the Burundi Ambassador and tell him that as a result of the systematic killings which took place in his country we cannot consider our relations to be normal. This line would anger the Burundi Government but probably not lead to a break in relations or to an ouster of our mission there. Such an ouster would not be in our interest because of our desire (State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> feel strongly about this) to monitor potential anti-Zairian activity in Burundi. (As African maps indicate, Burundi is the back door to the traditionally most restive part of Zaire (Congo). If the PRC or <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wanted to stir up trouble in Eastern Zaire, Burundi would be the ideal basing point for rebels.) Otherwise, our interests in Burundi are minimal.</p>
                        <p>Some further thoughts on our future Burundi policy are contained in the brief paper written by our Ambassador to Burundi at Tab 3. The Ambassador agrees that we should have a minimal presence in Burundi but wants to have the leeway to make small gestures to the Burundi Government in order to: (1) encourage reconciliation, (2) lessen the risk that Burundi will think the West is abandoning it -- as Belgium slowly reduces its presence --, and (3) maintain our ability to monitor PRC and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> activity, particularly if it is directed against Zaire.</p>

                        <p>We recommend that as outlined at Tab 1 the Presidentʼs instructions be conveyed orally to the Department of State, preferably by General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> to Ted Eliot, to avoid any possible leakage of the Presidentʼs feelings on this matter. If not, questions might be asked about why it took us so long to convey our outrage to Burundi. If you disagree, and want the record to show our reaction, a memorandum for your signature to the Secretary of State is at Tab 1.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>

                        <p>As a result of the mass murders which recently took place in Burundi, the President has directed that official relations with that state should be minimal.

                        </list>
                        <p>In view of the considerable current interest in the U.S. relationship with Burundi, I would like to make one or two comments for the record. They are made in the light of events since submission of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName>ʼs memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, dated September 24, 1972, and are of course purely personal.</p>
                        <p>1. Recent political developments in Burundi indicate a growth in the strength of the more moderate of the Tutsi factions comprising the cabinet. The Prime Minister can be said to head this faction, although it appears to have the general support if not guidance, of President Micombero. Such national reconciliation as may be possible in the coming months will, I believe, take place more easily under this group than under the leadership of the Simbananiye-Shibura-Rwuri faction. The latter is more radical both on foreign policy matters and on the question of how to deal with the Hutu majority.</p>
                        <p>2. We have indications that the Belgians are seriously considering terminating their military assistance to Burundi over the next year or two. While multilateral and bilateral economic assistance to Burundi may remain at roughly recent levels, the prospect of losing Belgian military support is likely to have a disproportionate effect on the insecure Tutsi regime. In this atmosphere, any U.S. move vis.a.vis Burundi would be examined closely for its implications for total Western intentions toward that country. The GRB is lonely and will certainly seek alternatives if it thinks the West is pulling out.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d228-06" facs="d228-06"/>
                        <p>3. Chinese interest in economic [text illegible] in Burundi continues. PRC willingness to help fill the potential military gap cannot be ruled out, though a minority elitist government is not the most comfortable bedfellow for the PRC or perhaps -- in the longer term -- the most useful one. In any event, both the PRC and President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> continue today to consider Burundi an important piece of real estate at the vulnerable eastern door to Zaire. If the Zaire rebels were given active support by a Burundi government, including the use of sanctuary and supply lines, the Zaire government would be faced with a substantially more serious dissident problem in the East. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>I therefore believe that it is in the interest of the U.S. to retain the greatest possible flexibility in Burundi, continuing our minimum presence during the current difficult period but leaving us free to make selected gestures toward the GRB if political and intertribal developments within Burundi make this useful and feasible.</p>

                        <p>Burundi Ambassador Terence was called to the Department October 18 and informed of our new policy toward his government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">David Newsom</persName> expressed our profound shock at the mass killing of Hutus. He said we have no choice but to maintain our relations with Burundi at a minimum level.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was defensive. He acknowledged that the governmentʼs response to the initial uprising was severe, but claimed that the threat to governmental authority was massive and potentially lethal. He denied any ethnic character to the reprisals, and argued that the situation has now returned to normal. He said he was sure his government could provide evidence of national reconciliation and of the equitable distribution of relief assistance.</p>
                        <p>Our new policy should not come as a surprise to Burundi. During my stay in New York, the Burundi Foreign Minister asked to see me. I refused even though I received every other foreign minister who requested an appointment. I also deplored the Burundi massacre in talks with ten of the African ministers, a number of whom expressed agreement. <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">George Bush</persName> also pointedly failed to attend the Burundi reception on October 12.</p>
                        <p>In Burundi itself, the killings have ended, but the atmosphere is still tense. This no indication that <pb n="2" xml:id="d229-02" facs="d229-02"/>the 50,000 refugees in neighboring countries feel it is safe to return.</p>
                        <p>On the positive side, the continuing power struggle among Tutsis has edged virtually all of the most extremist politicians from public office. The group now in the ascendancy has shown signs in the past of wanting to reach a political accommodation with the Hutu majority. Recent public statements by Prime Minister Nyamoya have stressed the theme of national reconciliation. With respect to relief for the victims, United Nations Under Secretary Brad Morse informs us he now has assurances from the Burundi Government that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> medical teams will be allowed to travel freely and dispense treatment without restriction. Whether or not the assurances are genuine remains to be seen within the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Until there is a much clearer indication of changed attitudes and policies from the Burundi Government, our activities will be confined to strictly humanitarian programs in support of voluntary and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies. For the present, therefore, we will suspend self-help, a rural health center project, population activities, cultural exchanges, and the admission of students to the International Police Academy.</p>
                        <p>Our current bilateral action should help persuade the present leadership that while the killings have stopped, the shockwave is still reverberating. To the extent that the Tutsi leadership cares about external opinion, our reaction may enhance the current barely perceptible trend toward moderation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yost has been recalled for consultation and is now in Washington.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I am planning to interpose no objection on political grounds to a forthcoming loan to Burundi by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. I believe that multilateral assistance of this type does not represent endorsement of the Micombero persecution of the Hutu population of his country.</p>
                        <p>The proposed loan of $4.5 million of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> funds is for improvement of an important north-south road link within Burundi. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> helped finance some improvement of this road between 1962 and 1965. In 1970, however, an <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> survey of Burundiʼs roads indicated serious deterioration of this artery to tourism, fishing, cotton and coffee production, in one of Africaʼs poorest countries. The area was further devastated by the rebel Hutu incursion in late April of this year. Thus, the project now resembles more a rehabilitation project than a development project.</p>
                        <p>It is unusual for the United States Executive Director to oppose a loan in the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> Executive Board, particularly on political grounds. I do not believe such opposition is warranted in this instance. Under the circumstances the loan is expected to be approved routinely in December without objection.</p>

                        <p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>Since the Congo achieved its sudden independence in mid-1960, U.S. policies toward this country have been based on the conviction that our long-term interests here and throughout central Africa were closely tied to a united, viable Congo. In the face of diverse centrifugal forces which threatened to break the Congo into a half-dozen feuding mini-states, paving the way for significant communist inroads and inviting a full scale Cold War struggle for control, we stressed territorial unity and political stability as the best means of ensuring our interests and avoiding chaos. And beyond the emergency of the Independence transition, we foresaw the possibility that a strong, prosperous Congo might eventually become an important force for either stability or change throughout black Africa, one whose friendship and cooperation might be counted upon to advance our own broader interests in the area.</p>
                        <p>Our estimate of the immediate dangers proved correct. During its earlier periods of almost constant turmoil, the Congo became a classic study in the tactics of subversion and the agonies of nation-building.</p>
                        <p>Tendencies toward chaos and fragmentation almost invariably favored outside interests opposed to our own and spilled over in insecurity outside the Congoʼs borders. Unfriendly forces appeared repeatedly on the verge of gaining a permanent foothold in one area or another by exploiting regional divisions or internal disorder.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d232-02" facs="d232-02"/>
                        <p>We responded with policies which implied an extraordinary degree of involvement in the Congoʼs internal affairs, both political and economic. In a campaign to hold the country together and put it on its feet, we have by now invested an estimated half-billion dollars in a wide variety of programs, partly under our own direct supervision and partly in support of United Nations activities designed with similar goals in mind. In addition, we have invested considerable amounts of national prestige and influence in efforts to secure the support of other governments and of the Congolese themselves for these same goals.</p>
                        <p>The emergency phase appears to have passed. Our goals of unity and stability for the Congo have been achieved to a remarkable degree. As fragile as its present state, the Congoʼs outlook for continuing viability and growth is today no more uncertain than that of many other third-world countries in whose internal affairs we would not now involve ourselves so deeply as we have in the Congoʼs. We no longer look at the Congo as the sick man of Africa, requiring our constant ministrations, but as a force capable in its own right of exerting a positive influence upon events beyond its borders.</p>
                        <p>II. OUR INTERESTS IN THE CONGO TODAY</p>
                        <p>“Classical” United States interests in the Congo are not inconsiderable, and they have grown during the past two years as prospects for continued tranquility have improved. Basically, these are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Continued availability to the West of the Congoʼs key primary products, on terms both advantageous to the Congo and commensurate with the requirements of world market stability;</p>
                        <p>2. Ready access to the growing Congolese industrial and consumer markets for American exporters, on at least an equal basis with suppliers from other countries;</p>
                        <p>3. Favorable treatment for private American investors interested in risking their capital in the Congoʼs development;</p>
                        <p>4. Protection under the law of the personal rights of American citizens at work in this country, including some 3000 missionaries;</p>
                        <p>5. Continued availability and easy access to Congolese airfields for US aircraft, particularly those engaged in surveillance of South Atlantic waters and those transiting Africa toward Indian Ocean destinations;</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d232-03" facs="d232-03"/>
                        <p>6. Diplomatic support for our positions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in other international forums, as well as continuing opposition to the admission of the Communist Chinese bloc members to these organizations; and</p>
                        <p>7. Maintenance by the Congo of friendly, cooperative relations with other countries of the West and Third World important to our interests.</p>
                        <p>Our current interests in the Congo by no means end there, however. Our investment in the countryʼs unity and stability has made it possible for us to think in considerably broader terms.</p>
                        <p>By virtue of its enormous size, strategic location, natural wealth, favorable demography, and ethnic mixture, a united Congo is potentially the most powerful and influential black state in sub-Saharan Africa. It has already amply demonstrated the degree to which events and turmoil here can have repercussions far beyond its borders. A united, stable, and developing Congo friendly to the United States will increasingly be in a position to exercise a positive influence in our favor upon developments throughout black Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Congoʼs geographic situation, strength, and outlook are particularly relevant to black Africaʼs confrontation with the white-ruled Southern tier. The Congo shares 1500 miles of common border with Portuguese-governed Angola, and it harbors some 300,000 to 500,000 Angolan refugees inside that border. For these reasons alone, it must involve itself in the entire confrontation problem and make appropriate pan-African noises from time to time. Yet the Congoʼs fervor is tempered considerably by its practical need to evacuate a large proportion of its all-important copper production across Angolan territory to the port of Lobito. Thus, the Congoʼs self-interest dictates for the short term a more moderate approach than that of some pan-African radicals, one which dovetails with our own hope of avoiding an all-out clash between white and black Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Congo is not only rich in natural resources: its borders encompass an unusually comfortable “mix” of primary materials and agricultural potential, well-developed though run-down economic and social infrastructures, a favorable pattern of population distribution, and a satisfactory pool of fundamental manpower skills to permit exceptional hope for sound, balanced development given stable political conditions. A relatively modest catalytic input of developmental <pb n="4" xml:id="d232-04" facs="d232-04"/>assistance here may be expected to pay greater dividends than in a fundamentally poorer country. And a successful Congolese model might also help to dramatize the value of regional economic cooperation among less-favored neighbors. Thus the Congo offers us a potentially valuable proving ground for development and eventually perhaps a useful model for its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>III. IMPACT OF UNITED STATES POLICIES TO DATE</p>
                        <p>A. The Congo has made great strides toward political stability and national unity during the past three years of <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs rule. Its governmental machinery runs somewhat better, its security forces are stronger, and its image abroad is more favorable now than at any time since Independence. Danger areas persist, however, particularly in economic and fiscal matters, and acceptance of the regime is grudging among many. Yet we see no convincing reason why the present trend is unlikely to continue at least through 1970.</p>
                        <p>B. While the Congoʼs policies and the measure of internal security which these have obtained, as well as the signal accomplishments of the monetary reform, have resulted in significantly improving the business climate generally and have paved the way for increased foreign investment, in certain vital areas economic progress is not keeping pace with achievements in the political sector. The regime sadly lacks clear developmental priorities and sound control over its spending. However, the <gloss target="#t_GDRC1">GDRC</gloss> has alleviated technical skills shortages through business contracts with the private sector for needed services, thus reducing the need for direct governmental assistance from abroad.</p>
                        <p>C. With its problems of unity and stability at home reduced to manageable proportions, the Congo is increasingly turning its attention to the larger African context. After toying with several postures and power experiments, the <gloss target="#t_GDRC1">GDRC</gloss> seems to be finding its place of moderate leadership, and other Africans are beginning to appreciate its growing strength and potential influence.</p>
                        <p>D. The United States may justly take a large part of the credit for the Congoʼs progress in recent years. Our psychological and diplomatic support for Kinshasa (and by implication for <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>) has materially impeded the fragmentation process while encouraging a sense of national identity, pride, and self-confidence. Our material help in riding out periods of economic dislocation, political disorder, <pb n="5" xml:id="d232-05" facs="d232-05"/>and subversion has literally held the country together. Our assistance contributed successfully to the establishment, of a sounder economic base through the monetary reform, but along with our aid we have probably fostered illusions which exaggerate both our influence and our interest here.</p>
                        <p>E. The Congo today is probably as able as many Third World countries to solve its own everyday problems and absorb setbacks. With the emergency phase over, we should now begin to focus our attention more upon the Congoʼs long-term prospects for developmental growth and political influence in Africa. In so doing, we should concentrate our energies and resources on advancing our broader interests and worry less about our responsiveness to politically inspired <gloss target="#t_GDRC1">GDRC</gloss> wishes and short-term objectives.</p>
                        <p>F. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is closely identified with us and we with him. An important key to his unquestionable strength lies in this relationship, and our hope for continued stability rests mainly upon him. Both we and he would probably like to see this dependent relationship loosened somewhat. But we both recognize that a sudden suggestion of withdrawal on our part could seriously undermine his position and hence prejudice our own investment in the Congoʼs stability. We must thus play an extremely careful and subtle game, confining our advice mainly to vital matters, yet continuing to assure him publicly and privately of the United Statesʼ continuing interest in a stable, united Congo.</p>
                        <p>IV. CONTINUING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p>In pursuit of our up-dated relationship with the Congo and its President, we propose the following guidelines:</p>
                        <p>A. International Affairs:</p>
                        <p>1. Quietly support <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs pragmatic position on Angola and the southern tier, encouraging consultation with fellow African moderates and active participation on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Committee of 24 and African Liberation Committee.</p>
                        <p>2. Encourage the Congo to continue its participation in <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OCAM1">OCAM</gloss> efforts to find a solution to the Nigerian conflict.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d232-06" facs="d232-06"/>
                        <p>3. If necessary, attempt to discourage the President from foolish political, military and financial adventures in Congo-Brazzaville and other neighboring countries which might undermine the areaʼs stability.</p>
                        <p>4. Invite <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to visit the United States officially next fall.</p>
                        <p>B. Congolese Internal Affairs:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs economic ineptitude in general, and his fiscal irresponsibility in particular, may yet bring the political edifice he has erected crashing down around his ears. This may not happen for some time, but it could happen fairly soon if the copper price breaks. This situation poses a sharp dilemma for U.S. policy. On the one hand, active intervention with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to change his ways may jeopardize our relations with him and the privileged status that we enjoy in the Congo. On the other hand, if the Congo reverts to political and economic chaos, our whole position in sub-Sahara Africa cannot fail to be compromised. It seems better to take the risks of discrete intervention since we may not have much to lose, anyway. We have made a beginning at this already, and the results have not been entirely discouraging.</p>
                        <p>2. Equally important is the critical question of optimum allocation of resources and establishment of developmental priorities. We should use all leverage at our disposal, through our prestige and influence in general and our aid program in particular, to help bring about much-needed improvements in this area. A small nucleus of the abler, more thoughtful officials in <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs government already are well aware of the potential value of engaging foreign consultants to assist in this complex task. We should offer all possible help and encouragement, if necessary with financial assistance, to bring in teams of planners and technical experts to prepare studies and recommend priorities, especially in infrastructure and agricultural development, but also in other sectors of the Congolese economy. In this endeavor we should try to coordinate our efforts closely with those of the World Bank, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the European Development Fund.</p>
                        <p>3. The Congo needs major inputs of new direct foreign investment, and the economy is now better able to absorb such capital. In addition to the program of U.S. development lending scheduled to begin in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ʼ70, we therefore should make every effort to encourage <pb n="7" xml:id="d232-07" facs="d232-07"/>and assist U.S. potential investors here, drawing on the services of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>ʼs private investment program and the Export-Import Bank. At the same time, we should urge the Congolese to support these efforts through better identification of investment opportunities, promulgation of the long-overdue investment law, and implementation of the projected Congolese development bank.</p>
                        <p>4. In tandem with our efforts to attract U.S. investment, we should strive to advance a more classical policy objective: the promotion of U.S.-Congolese trade and an absolute as well as relative increase of American exports to the Congo.</p>
                        <p>5. In order to remove one major obstacle to foreign investment (and a potentially troublesome blight on Belgo-Congolese relations) we should use our influence with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to move him toward settlement of the UMHK dispute, with or without World Bank mediation. Obviously this is an extremely delicate matter, calling for the utmost in diplomatic skill, tact and discretion. Nevertheless the objective is sufficiently important to warrant using propitious and appropriate occasions to tread on this dangerous ground.</p>
                        <p>6. Since the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> is the ultimate source of power in the Congo, we should maintain our close ties with the Congolese military by continuing our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, Defense Attache and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> language programs. The objectives of these programs should continue to be geared toward modernization and reduction in size of the military forces as well as maintaining friendly contacts with actual and potential leaders within the various officer grades.</p>
                        <p>7. Although we should avoid the temptation to give advice to Mobutu except on matters of direct importance to our efforts in the Congo (mainly in the economic and military fields), it is vital that the American Ambassador maintain direct and intimate contact with the President so as to assure him that when he needs and requests advice the USG will always be listening sympathetically.</p>

                        <p>NOTE</p>
                        <p>Congolese internal affairs appear on the surface at least to be tranquil, almost humdrum. This is remarkable, considering the prolonged turmoil and violence of the first half decade of Congolese independence. In those years, the US became deeply involved in preserving central authority against challenges from Communist-armed rebels, unruly mercenaries, Katangan secessionists, and other provincial and tribal factions. US assistance given directly to the Congo or through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping agencies has amounted to over a half billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>It is the purpose of this estimate to examine anew the political and economic bases of the Congolese state, and to determine how much confidence can be placed in its weak institutions over the next two to three years.</p>
                        <p>The principal conclusions are in the last three paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>THE ESTIMATE</p>
                        <p>I. TRANQUILITY ON THE SURFACE</p>
                        <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> seized power in Congo (Kinshasa) in November 1965, marking the end of the most chaotic phase of that countryʼs troubled history. Ever since independence from Belgium in 1960, a series of army mutinies, secessions, and violent xenophobic outbursts -- primarily directed at the Belgians -- had kept the Congo in a state of anarchy. Tens of thousands of Belgian functionaries fled the country, leaving the ill-prepared Congolese administration in utter disorder. Some outsiders, including the Soviets and Communist Chinese, provided support to some of the rebellious groups; others, behind the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, stepped in to provide a semblance of order. In the process, the Congo became an example to the world of everything that could go wrong in a newly independent country.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d233-06" facs="d233-06"/>
                        <p>2. Much of the credit for the Congoʼs recovery and relative stability in recent years is due to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. He has managed to concentrate authority in his own hands and remove from power everyone who could have posed a threat to his control. His main power base, the Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss>), is apparently loyal to him, and Mobutu has built a personal political party, the Mouvement Populaire de la Revolution (MPR), in an effort to create some semblance of popular support nation-wide. The MPR has failed to arouse much grass-roots enthusiasm for <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, but it does provide a mechanism for patronage and for managing the elections in the fall of 1970. It also helps to occupy otherwise unemployed or dissident politicians and provides some feedback for popular opinion.</p>
                        <p>3. Presidential land parliamentary elections are scheduled for November and December 1970, respectively. As the sole candidate for president, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is assured of election. All candidates for parliament are MPR members, and the reconvened parliament will be tightly controlled by the president, through the MPR. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> will continue to monopolize authority, and parliament will be confined to little more than rubber-stamping his decisions. Its election, how-ever, will represent a tentative step towards the development of national political institutions and the provision of an outlet for regional grievances and political, energies.</p>
                        <p>4. The improvement in public order over the last few years has permitted the economy to recover somewhat and encouraged the return of foreigners, mainly Belgians. These outsiders are needed to fill almost all the managerial posts in industry and commerce, advise the government, train the armed forces, and run the Congolese schools. The nationalized copper industry, buoyed by the high world price, is yielding greater revenues than expected. This has improved the Congoʼs foreign exchange position, added greatly to its fiscal revenues, and enabled the government to spend roughly $400 Million a year.</p>
                        <p>II. SOME PROBLEM AREAS</p>
                        <p>5. Beneath the surface, however, many serious problems remain. In the first place, the Congolese Government is basically a one man show. There are functional ministries, a civil service, and an expanding party apparatus. But none of these are efficient, and most are corrupt. In general, the political institutions have shallow roots and currently operate as little more than palace appendages. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs advisors, including the cabinet, are politically unimportant technocrats Who owe their position to the president and are not inclined to make waves. While all this accords with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs style and ensures a sole source of authority, it is a very vulnerable system in that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs sudden departure from the national scene would leave a serious political void.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> personally has a lot going for him—political know-how, a talent for balancing tribal interests, considerable practicality, and courage -- but he also has some significant weaknesses. He can only focus on one problem at a time, tends to immerse himself in minutiae, and wears himself out periodically. <pb n="7" xml:id="d233-07" facs="d233-07"/>His need to be in control coupled with his fear and suspicion of competitors makes him unable to delegate authority, especially under stress. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> has his share of vanity and is fond of spending money on prestige projects—such as costly monuments and palaces -- that drain away a good part of the Congoʼs copper revenue. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> personally disposes of perhaps $50 million a year of unaccountable government funds. Admittedly, as an important chief, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is expected to dole out large gifts if he is to command respect. Some of this money ends up supplementing military salaries, funding MPR activities, or backing worthwhile projects which would otherwise be buried in the bureaucratic morass. But altogether this spending is on a scale that contributes heavily to the growing inflation and could threaten the Congoʼs financial stability.</p>
                        <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> is both the main prop of the regime and the greatest threat to public order. It holds a virtual monopoly of coercive power in the Congo, but, though there has been some improvement in the past few years, it remains poorly trained, relatively, undisciplined, and militarily unreliable. Soldiers still occasionally beat and rob the populace; many of the officers line their pockets by organizing rackets. There has been at least one incident when soldiers, angry at delays in being paid, attacked local MPR representatives who seemed to be better cared for by the central government.</p>
                        <p>8. Despite its deficiencies, the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> manages to keep the provinces under a rough kind of control and does cope with occasional forays by rebel bands in the eastern Congo. Moreover, the army leadership appears reasonably loyal to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. The top positions in the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> are largely filled with his long-time associates, and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> has made some effort to maintain contact with many of the younger officers. There is considerable discontent among junior officers with their relatively uneducated superiors, but little evidence of conspiratorial organization. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is careful to make sure that military pay scales keep pace with rising prices and is willing to acquiesce in low-level graft. He also manages to provide the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> with modern equipment and has authorized its expansion from its present 44,000 to a total of 50,000 over the next few years. According to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, this buildup, which is focused on “elite” paracommando units, is necessary to guard against outside aggression and to discourage opponents of his regime. He probably also believes it will add to the Congoʼs prestige internationally.</p>
                        <p>9. While probably, helpful in keeping the military busy and contented, this expansion will amount to a further drain on the Congolese budget. The <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> is already the second largest army in black Africa and appears more than adequate in numbers to handle any likely internal and external threats. Instead, its very size may tempt <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> or his successor to indulge in moves against obstreperous neighbors. Current plans call for more centralized control and management, but increases in size would be likely to lead to more unwieldiness because of increased logistical problems, poor leadership, lack of expertise in technical and administrative staffs, and inadequate training. In the longer run, <pb n="8" xml:id="d233-08" facs="d233-08"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs plan to increase it to about 75,000 in 10 years will only add to difficulties and would heighten the chances of politically oriented cliques forming within the military.</p>
                        <p>10. The Pax Mobutu has provided at least a minimum of security throughout the Congo and some economic restoration in the capital, in Katanga, and in a few other places. In most of the country, however, particularly in the potentially productive areas of the north and northeast, the destruction and misuse of the economic infrastruture in the early 1960s has left a monumental problem. Throughout much of the Congo, roads are in serious disrepair, rivers are silted, bridges are out, and most river and rail transport has deteriorated through administrative disorder and inadequate or non-existent maintenance. All this has led to agricultural stagnation, high food prices in the larger cities, and a country-side largely out of touch with its regional government, to say nothing of Kinshasa. Yet the political consequences to the Congolese Government in the short-term are probably not great. Most of the rural populace are apathetic and wary of any repetition of the civil strife that plagued the Congo in the immediate post-independence years. There is no political nucleus around which grievances can be crystallized or active opposition to the regime stimulated.</p>
                        <p>11. A more, immediate political problem for the regime is the popular discontent in the cities. Most grievances stem from a generalized feeling that pre-independence expectations have not been achieved. The Congolese tend to accept, in part, stories that foreign machinations were responsible for the unfulfilled promises, but there is also a strong feeling that their own leaders have been indifferent, stupid, and venal. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is primarily concerned with popular attitudes in Kinshasa and tends to neglect the other cities. At the moment, Kinshasa is a boom town. Jobs in construction are plentiful and food is avail-able, though expensive. Several rounds of wage increases have softened the impact of steadily rising prices. Should economic conditions deteriorate seriously in the capital, however, the political impact on the regime could be damaging.</p>
                        <p>12. In any foreseeable urban crisis, chronically disaffected university students would probably take the lead. In mid-1969, a group of radical students tried to kindle a general uprising of workers in Kinshasa—but were thwarted by the apathy of the people and the force of the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss>. In the future, more sophisticated leftists might be able to mold urban and student discontent into a serious leftist movement. By themselves, however, radical students will probably not pose a major threat to the government.</p>
                        <p>13. The main threat to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs regime, apart from the possibility of assassination, is likely to come from within the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss>—especially as time goes on junior officers will almost certainly remain restless and may be further irritated, along with others, if the MPR gains in importance. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> will try to reduce the danger by continuing to give favored treatment to the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> and by maneuvering to prevent organized opposition within it. Should he be removed from office, the civil service would provide some continuity and might have a bigger role <pb n="9" xml:id="d233-09" facs="d233-09"/>in running the country. But the military would have the deciding voice in choosing the next president. There is no obvious choice to replace <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, and his removal would lead to considerable political confusion. If army officers were unable to agree on a successor, it might also lead to armed conflict.</p>
                        <p>14. For all its weaknesses, the Congo might weather the test of <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs sudden departure. Over the past decade, the Kinshasa Government has acquired its own style-reflecting Congolese rather than Western values—that would help sustain public order and possibly an on-going administration during periods of political uncertainty. These emerging stabilizing factors, however, will not in themselves ensure a successful transition to post-<persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> politics or freedom from internal upheavals.</p>
                        <p>III. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">MOBUTU</persName>ʼS FOREIGN POLICY</p>
                        <p>15. Despite the serious domestic problems that remain in the Congo, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is often diverted to involvement in the internal affairs of neighboring countries. His concern stems partly from his belief that Congo (Kinshasa ) as the dominant state in Central Africa should have a voice in what goes on in the whole area. More important, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> sees the Congo as virtually surrounded by radical nations, some under Chinese Communist influence. He tends to exaggerate this threat. Doubtless the Chinese and some of <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs neighbors would be happy to see <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> replaced by someone not so closely aligned with the West, but there is no evidence of serious outside plotting by Communist China or any other government to overthrow him.</p>
                        <p>13. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> —- acutely aware of Egyptian, Soviet and Communist Chinese support of dissident Congolese elements in the past -- has asked Uganda, Sudan, and Burundi to repatriate Congolese political refugees. He has had some success in this, as opposed to his inept attempts to unseat the Ngouabi regime in Congo (Brazzaville ). The cordiality of the recent “summit meeting” of Central African chiefs of state in Kinshasa is not indicative of a major shift in <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs policies. We think he will continue to build up his military and clandestine capability to try to influence his neighbors.</p>
                        <p>17. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> occasionally reveals aspirations to play the role of an African statesman. His prestige, however, derives mainly from being chief of Central Africaʼs largest and richest country. Somewhat paternally, he even gives aid to a few of the poorer central African countries: military training for the Chadian Army and budgetary supplements for Burundi. The earlier suspicions of some African leaders that Mobutu was too pro-Western and not sufficiently “African” in outlook have been somewhat allayed in recent years. But his own ambitions aid the Congoʼs power —- actual and potential -- are still alarming to some of 1 his neighbors.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> expects that the US will continue to provide some military vehicles, communications equipment, and transport aircraft for the Congolese <pb n="10" xml:id="d233-10" facs="d233-10"/>Armed Forces.(1) He assumes that the US will be responsive to his analysis of the “Communist threat,” even though US officials have played it down. He would, therefore, be surprised if the US were to turn down his military requests. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> has always looked upon us as his major foreign backer and often speaks of the special relationship between the US and the Congo. He would undoubtedly turn to alternate sources of supply, most probably France and Italy.</p>
                        <p>(1) Official US military assistance to the Congo amounted to $3.5 million In fiscal year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>) 1967. It dropped to $2.5 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 and $1.8 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970. It is projected at $0.3 million in 1971. No further military assistance is planned; it is to be replaced by a military sales program covering the same commodities.</p>
                        <p>19. Although <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is happy to accept French military equipment, adminis- trative and technical assistance, and guidance for his growing radio and television systems, he will probably I remain suspicious of French intentions. He is likely, however, to find ways to take advantage of Franceʼs interest in expanding its presence in the Congo. He hopes to diversify foreign investment in the Congo and would be receptive to French commercial overtures. He will probably encourage the French, therefore, despite lingering memory of French involvement in the Katanga secession and subsequent mercenary activities.</p>
                        <p>20. Relations with Belgium are particularly important for the Congo. Some 40,000 Belgians are now in the Congo as compared to around 90,000 in 1959; they remain indispensable for the continued functioning of key industries, utilities, and educational institutions. Many still have the “colonial mentality” that so frustrates the Congolese, but the Belgians and Congolese remain useful to each other. Most Belgian businessmen are interested primarily in short-term profits, and a number of Belgian middlemen have been caught in shady business practices that tend to confirm Congolese suspicions of foreign trickery in economic activities. Despite the heritage of bitterness and complaint, however, relations with Belgium are fairly good and may improve further.</p>
                        <p>21. We expect <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to continue to deal pragmatically with the white regimes of southern Africa despite the objections of Zambia and Tanzania. Commercial relations with South Africa are not deterred by Congolese distaste for apartheid, and the Congolese continue to import Rhodesian coal and food despite UN sanctions. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> opportunistically has developed a fairly close, relationship with the Portuguese in Angola. He believes that Angola poses less of a threat to Congolese interests than do his other neighbors and realizes that Katanga Province is dependent on the Benguela railroad for essential imports and an important part of copper exports. Recently the Congolese Government has quietly permitted three Portuguese diplomats to conduct consular activities in Kinshasa and has been less cooperative than it used to be with Holden Robertoʼs Angolan Revolutionary Government in Exile (<gloss target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs government has been reserved in its dealings with, the Soviets. Four low-level Soviet diplomats were recently expelled as a warning against further meddling in Congolese internal affairs. We believe <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> will continue to tolerate a limited Soviet presence in Kinshasa, largely because he wants <pb n="11" xml:id="d233-11" facs="d233-11"/>to establish non-aligned credentials. But he will react quickly to any new Russian mischief-making and is not likely to seek warmer relations unless the West is totally unresponsive to his requests.</p>
                        <p>IV. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</p>
                        <p>23. In some ways, the Congoʼs economic prospects look quite good. Monetary and fiscal reforms promulgated in 1967 established order in foreign trade and government finance. A considerable jump in the price of copper has led to record high levels of government receipts and foreign exchange holdings. Following the enactment of a liberal investment code and generous settlement of the dispute over nationalization of the Belgian-owned copper mines, foreign businessmen flocked to Kinshasa to look into the investment situation. Other than the Japanese, however, whose interest in copper predates the 1967 reforms, few, have stayed. Prospective investors from the US and Belgium, deterred by the small domestic markets in the Congo, usually express interest only in export-oriented activities. In addition, they are put off by the unpredictability of the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss>, the deterioration of the infrastructure, the venality of Congolese officials, bureaucratic roadblocks, the lack of skilled Congolese technicians, and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs erratic decision-making in the investment area.</p>
                        <p>24. The short term outlook for earnings from copper is uncertain. Prices have remained very high in the past few years, and world demand for copper should continue fairly strong over the longer run. The major copper-consuming industries in the developed countries are expected to be among the fastest growing in the 1970s, and new users for copper are likely to contribute to the demand. Consistently high copper prices would provide the Congo with a windfall of money and time—an opportunity to pay government salaries, to buttress the other sectors of the economy, and to strengthen incentives for renewed investment. Thus prospects for political stability, economic development, and, foreign investment would be far better if copper prices hold up than if they were to drop Substantially. But, even so, much depends on how Mobutu chooses to allocate the copper revenues.</p>
                        <p>25. Another important, factor in the Congoʼs future is the role of the 65,000 or so non-Africans in the country, a role complicated by xenophobia and the Congolese drive for economic independence. These factors and the actions of the Congolese Government affect different segments of this group in different ways. The Congolese Government is encouraging the Congolization of small scale commerce, and, in the fall of 1969, some Asian middlemen, especially in Kivu Province, were expelled. The important Greek, Portuguese, and Jewish commercial communities have so far been left alone. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> has a plan to prevent foreign businessmen from dealing with the Congolese through intermediaries -- mostly Belgians. If the scheme is rigorously carried out, many intermediaries would be tempted to close up shop. We do not, however, expect the Congolese Government to drive out major businesses. Small-scale merchants and traders are likely to continue to be subjected to sudden arbitrary decrees and expulsion.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d233-12" facs="d233-12"/>
                        <p>26. Most Belgians and Americans will probably be spared this kind of harassment, at least as long as the Congolese Government needs economic and military assistance from Brussels and Washington. The US now provides the (Congo around $30 million a year in overall aid and Belgium provides some $50 million.(2) In addition the World Bank, following settlement of the copper nationalization in 1969, seems ready to help rebuild the Congolese economic infra-structure. The Congolese Government has by now come to expect a substantial level of foreign aid and would be quite sensitive to any sizeable cutbacks over the next few years.</p>
                        <p>(2) This compares with US economic and military aid of $50 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1907, $112 million in 1963, and $144 million in 1961. In the early 1960s, Belgium supplied $75 million a year in aid and an additional $50 million for debts, pensions, and a military advisory group.</p>
                        <p>V. LONGER RANGE PROSPECTS</p>
                        <p>27. The strength of the Congo today is also its weakness. It is virtually dependent on one man, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, and one export commodity, copper. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> seems firmly in control at the moment. He has restored a degree of unity and order and given the Congo status in Africa. Under his rule, the Congo has made some progress towards economic recovery, and central institutions are developing which add a measure of stability. We cannot, however, rule out a coalescence of discontented elements against him (some junior officers, radical students, urban unemployed, and farmers unable to market their goods). Especially as the years go on, there will be a tendency to blame all ills on the ubiquitous president. Moreover, should Mobutu be overthrown or die in office, there may be serious difficulties in finding a successor acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> and to the country as a whole. The problem is complicated by <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs unwillingness to delegate authority and his dismissal of even close political allies when he suspects they may have independent ambitions. Still young enough at 39 to expect to be in office many more years, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> apparently makes no provision for succession.</p>
                        <p>28. High world copper prices have played a prominent role in the recovery of the Congoʼs economy. At present, copper provides 66 percent of the countryʼs foreign exchange. The price of copper is known for its fluctuation and unpredictability, however, and there is no assurance that it will remain near the level of $.60 per pound indefinitely. There is a danger that the government could be so seduced by the high world price that it would tend to forecast essential revenue on current prices. So far the Congolese have resisted this temptation. Were copper prices to fall substantially and remain down for some time, the economic repercussions would be severe. The government would be unable to meet its civilian payroll, and even the military would feel the, pinch. It is difficult to predict with certainty the level to which copper prices must fall before the government is in trouble, but the eventual political effects of a sustained significant drop would jeopardize the regime.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d233-13" facs="d233-13"/>
                        <p>29. Until such time as the Congo reconstructs its internal transportation network, the hinterland will remain largely cut off from Kinshasa and farmers will continue to have difficulty moving their crops. The Congolese Government, in conjunction with the World Bank and the US, is moving forward to implement plans for correcting this problem. The involvement of the World Bank is a hopeful factor, but the task of maintaining the rebuilt roads, bridges, and river routes would remain with the Congolese. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs natural preferences are to build up his armed forces, alleviate the capitalʼs pressing needs, and strengthen his political party rather than to focus on what he sees as politically less important projects in the rural areas. The government is generally, aware of the basic problem of priorities and indeed is likely to commit additional resources to the countryside. Given the magnitude of funds and effort needed for lasting improvement of the infrastructure, such an achievement is years away. In the meantime, the Congo will probably remain divided between a few enclaves of urban prosperity and a stagnating countryside.</p>

                            <item>Your Meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> of Congo (Kinshasa); (Phonetic: mo-BOO-too); 10:30 a.m., Tuesday, August 4.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>You last saw Mobuto on your visit to Kinshasa in June 1967.</p>
                        <p>Your substantive meeting takes place immediately following the 10:30 a m. arrival ceremony. You are hosting a State Dinner for him that evening. The Vice President will do the farewell honors on your behalf.</p>
                        <p>In Washington, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> will also meet with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>, Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, Administrator <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hannah</persName>, World Bank President McNamara and Congressional leaders. His official visit will be followed by a hard-working 5-day stay in New York devoted to promoting private U.S. investment in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Setting for the Visit</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Congo is one of our policy successes in Africa. In the Eisenhower Administration, we firmly committed ourselves to Congolese unity. After years of civil war <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> came to power in 1965, and has made a reality of Congolese unity. The Congolese -- and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> personally -- are acutely aware that the U.S. was the only non-African power to support Congolese territorial integrity despite all the attempts at dismemberment. In addition, our economic and military assistance (about $600 million since 1960) is recognized by the Congolese as an invaluable contribution to their stability and unity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is deeply concerned about the political instability and communist influence in Africa. He also feels that the Congoʼs size and wealth should give it a prime role in Central Africa. These concerns lead him, in meetings with foreign dignitaries, to focus on the Congoʼs strategic political <pb n="2" xml:id="d234-02" facs="d234-02"/>role. We, on the other hand, tend to the view that economic development should receive top priority. This difference of perspective can lead to vigorous discussion, as Secretary Rogers discovered in his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> last February.</p>
                        <p>Since coming to power, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> has extended government control to every corner of the country, and reduced insurgency to isolated banditry. He has ruled by decree, but on taking power promised a return to normal political activity within five years. Accordingly, he has scheduled Presidential and Parliamentary elections for November and December. The new Parliament will be largely a rubber stamp. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> will be the only Presidential candidate on the ballot. His re-election is certain, but will not much diminish the fact that his rule is based on Army support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Man</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is 39 years old, Catholic educated, strongly pro-Western and firmly anti-communist. He is thoroughly comfortable with both the substance and trappings of power after five years experience with it. He is courageous, politically astute, conservative in his approach to government, and relatively honest in a country where governmental corruption is a way of life. He recognizes in his bones that foreign private investment is essential to Congolese development. Not by nature a charismatic leader, he has nonetheless adopted a personal style redolent of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName>. He sees himself as the “politician-soldier”, who embodies the Congolese nation. He is a rational nationalist, sensitive to undue Belgian economic influence in his country but determined at the same time to nourish the reconciliation with Belgium and to maximize the practical advantages which this brings to the Congo. His domestic authority derives from the fact that he is the one person who can command a consensus within the Army. In addition, he has manipulated political forces in the Congo so that every potential rival for power, civilian or military, has been excluded from public office.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is seriously worried with what he considers the dangerous penetration of neighboring countries by the Chinese Communists, particularly in Congo (Brazzaville). He is concerned that the Chinese are to build the railroad between Tanzania and Zambia, and are helping train southern Africa guerrilla Forces. He believes the Chinese are also training and financing Congolese rebels in Tanzania. He is also disturbed by the pro-Nasser regime in the Sudan both because of his strong personal support for Israel and because the Sudanese permit the presence of a substantial number of Congolese rebels. <pb n="3" xml:id="d234-03" facs="d234-03"/>In short, he sees a danger of “communist encirclement” and thus wants to expand his military forces. (An incentive of equal force is probably his need to keep his officer corps happy.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">What He Wants</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Our recognition that Communist penetration of Central Africa requires special attention.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Suggested Response:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>-- We do not minimize this threat. We will continue to work closely with him in identifying Communist activities in Central Africa.</p>
                        <p>-- Ask <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> for his suggestions on how best to deal with the threat as he sees it.</p>
                        <p>--Express sympathy with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs concerns and confirm that you will make every effort to facilitate steps which the U.S. can realistically undertake to assist him.</p>
                        <p>2. Military equipment, on the grounds that the Congo wants to be able to bear the primary burden of its own defense, in accordance with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. He wants transport aircraft (C-130s) to improve the mobility of his army.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Suggested Response:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>-- In view of the Congoʼs size and recent history we appreciate his concern for adequate and mobile military forces.</p>
                        <p>-- Confirm that you will facilitate the purchase of C-130s and other necessary equipment. Caution that increasing Congressional opposition in the U.S. has made the prospects for grant military aid dim, thus it will be necessary to seek other means to facilitate the improvement of the Congoʼs defense capabilities.</p>
                        <p>-- Ask <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> for his assessment of the Congoʼs outlook for economic development in the light of its continuing need for military preparedness.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d234-04" facs="d234-04"/>
                        <p>3. Our help in encouraging American private investment in the Congo. He may also want U.S. aid to complete the railroad from the Katanga copper belt to the Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Suggested Response:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>--He is absolutely right in the importance he attaches to private investment -- and we wish him great success in New York. We will do what we can to help.</p>
                        <p>-- We admire his success in restoring economic stability and creating a better investment climate.</p>
                        <p>--- The World Bank can doubtless be of great help to him in creating the conditions necessary to attract private investment. He may wish to raise this in his meeting with McNamara.</p>
                        <p>-- We agree that a good transportation system is a high priority need. For that reason we are offering the $10 million loan to help rehabilitate the river transport system.</p>
                        <p>4. Civil aviation agreement. Pan Am has been flying to the Congo since the mid-1950ʼs. Since 1968 Mobutu has been trying to get reciprocal rights for Air Congo to fly to New York. We tried to discourage him because we do not think Air Congo is ready, but he has persisted and has made the grant to Pan Am of a second weekly frequency contingent upon our agreement. We are now prepared to agree.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Suggested Response:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>--You are aware of his desires and the U.S. is ready to agree to a weekly Air Congo flight to New York.</p>
                        <p>--You suggest that he discuss the details of this matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. Naval forces. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> wants to establish a naval force of about 50 patrol craft to operate on the Atlantic Coast, the Congo River and his extensive eastern lakes. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs plan is extremely ambitious and beyond U.S. capabilities to support, especially since we <pb n="5" xml:id="d234-05" facs="d234-05"/>will no longer provide grant military aid to the Congo in view of their own increasing economic viability. On the other hand, we are prepared to assist with this project by the provision of $1.5 million in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> money over a five-year period. This will result in the provision of approximately 10 patrol boats and 3 light patrol aircraft. The details of this assistance will be worked out by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hannah</persName> in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> this week.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Suggested Response:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>--We recognize the need for the improvement in the Congoʼs capability to patrol and secure its extensive waterways and we anticipate that we will be able, through <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, to assist with the provisionʼ of a few surface patrol craft and some light patrol aircraft.</p>
                        <p>--<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Administrator <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hannah</persName> is prepared to to discuss this matter in further detail with him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">What We Want</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From our point of view the visit is mainly protocolary. Therefore, our main purpose is to enable <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to air his concerns which will probably reflect his tendency to dramatize the external threat to Congolese security: to listen sympathetically to these concerns which are real from his perspective, and to confirm to him that the United States and you personally are conscious of his problems and oriented towards facilitating solutions. The responses suggested to you above should serve these purposes. In addition, you may wish to:</p>
                        <p>1. Express satisfaction at being able to return the hospitality he extended to you at Kinshasa in June, 1967.</p>
                        <p>2. Sympathize with the pressure he is under in an election year, and express your pleasure that he has nonetheless taken time for this visit.</p>
                        <p>3. State your appreciation of the hard work he is putting himself to in New York in order to promote American private investment in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Attached is background and biographic material.</p>
                        <p>There will be a brief photo opportunity at the beginning of your private meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>
                            </item>
                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (part of the time)</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The President renewed his welcome and spoke of the significance of President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> being the first leader of one of the newer African countries to visit with him. The President also said he was very pleased that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> was able to make the trip at this time. Although he had met some Prime Ministers and Chiefs of State of African countries informally, on their private visits to this country, he felt that it was important to have a State visit from the Chief of a major African country in order to emphasize and highlight the U.S. interest in helping the Congo and the newly independent countries. The Congo is certainly a very fine example of what the independent countries can achieve.</p>
                        <p>The President was pleased that President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> was going to New York to talk to the business leaders there. Since 1967 President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has often told business leaders that the Congo is a very good investment. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> knows that it is a country with a strong leader which welcomed private investment, where the people work hard and he wished <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> every success not only in the government program but in encouraging private investment in his country. The President emphasized that he likes his private discussions with visiting chiefs of state to be conducted in an atmosphere of complete frankness and of complete confidence that the discussion is kept private. He would like President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to tell him what are the dangers and needs of his country, and also of Africa. He wanted President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to speak of some of the countries whose leaders he would not be meeting.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> expressed his thanks, he felt completely at ease with the President and would speak with an open heart. The U.S. must know that in the Congo it has a firm, and strong ally. The problems of the Congo are of three types; political instability, security, and economic development. In the five years that he has been head of state, progress has been made in all three areas, but more needs to be done. The Congo today is stable, calm and peaceful but it is surrounded by the Congo (B) Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and the Sudan. All of which have strong Chinese Communist penetration. In the <gloss target="#t_CAR1">CAR</gloss>, Bokassa is unstable. So the Congo is stable, but surrounded by subversion that can endanger its stability.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked for the relative sizes of the armed forces of the Congo and its neighbors and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> answered that his armed forces are stronger than any of the surrounding countries, but his country is not sufficiently mature to be able to contain the threats of subversion. He had had a long talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> on the Chinese Communist dangers and the fact that the Congo is rich, non-communist, stable and the target for infiltration.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked what forms the subversion takes and what form of opposition President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> faces domestically? President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> responded that he has no opposition in the Congo having squashed it when he came to power, but there are 6 to 8 thousand Congolese refugees in Tanzania all of whom are trained and equipped by the Chicoms. There are smaller dissident groups in the Sudan, Congo (B) and Uganda.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked what was the answer to this. Obviously, a stronger Congo for one thing, but what could be done to stop the Communist operations from Zambia and Tanzania. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> pointed out the ease with which Lake Tanganyika can be crossed at night and ammunition and supplies landed in the bush and the interior. Land forces were adequate but the Lake and the river could not be adequately controlled and the budget was too heavily burdened as it was, hence the need for patrol river craft.</p>
                        <p>(This, and possible avenues for solving it, had already been discussed briefly with General Westmoreland. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to come in at this time.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> thought that some of the riverine craft now used in Vietnam might be gotten to President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> referred to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>ʼ latest message through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> concerning the C-130s. He emphasized that his 7, 000 paratroopers only had DC-3 available for transportation and referred to the recently announced authorization of purchase.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> emphasized that there are divided views in the United States as to whether countries should emphasize military or economic development.</p>
                        <p>In his view both should be taken care of. There was no point in building up a country economically if it were left defenseless and at the mercy of another poor but militarily strong country. He understood the need and the interests of the Congo. He asked if President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> felt that Chinese influence had increased in central Africa, and whether Chinese or Soviet influence was dominant.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> stated that the Chinese were the more dominant and dangerous of the two. The Soviets have shifted their tactics. They focus on students and cultural exchanges and scholarship programs. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> had just put an end to this through his Foreign Ministry. Scholarships will only be accepted for medicine, agriculture and mining studies in countries of the eastern bloc. They will no longer be permitted for the study of sociology, philosophy and law. The Soviets know they cannot overthrow the government and are working for the future, preparing cadres of young men trained in communist countries.</p>
                        <p>Chicom tactics are more dangerous. They are trying to precipitate bloody uprisings which will force the governments to use their armed forces, thus making themselves unpopular. Congolese refugees in the Sudan have admitted that they have been sent back to the Congo to start trouble. Now when Congolese refugees return from Sudan, Uganda etc. they are not allowed to return to their native provinces but are relocated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if African students have enough opportunity to study in non-communist countries or are communist countries offering to them more opportunities for studies. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> said that when the students come back from eastern bloc countries, they see the difference. Only the embittered and stubborn remain pro-communist. His experience was that some students who have studied in the U.S. or Belgian or French Universities come back with Communist ideas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that this bears out his understanding that African students in Moscow are unhappy there because of the strong racial feelings of the Soviets and of the hard regimentation which is alien to the African mind. But, on the other hand, when they come to western universities the radicals single them out for indoctrination. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> stressed that the remedy lies in economic development.</p>
                        <p>The President said that speaking very frankly we face a problem in Congress, which is well intentioned but believes that the answer is in economic development alone and opposes military assistance. Many in Congress feel that the danger of Soviet and communist subversion is a myth. Given this attitude, we have a problem in getting money and sale authorizations from Congress for such things as the C-130s President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> wants. The President did not want to make any promises he could not keep but he understood the importance of military as well as economic assistance. He would examine the question of river craft and would see that emphasis was put on it. Many in Congress and the government would say that the Congo needed to emphasize economic development, build schools etc., but President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> understood that there was no sense in cultivating something that could be snatched from you.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> emphasized that this view was very sound. To give military aid and to neglect economic development would kill Africa. But the Congo was a special case. It was a country which after independence had suffered trouble, secession, anarchy and chaos. Thanks to U.S. financial aid, this had been ended and the Congo had become strong. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> emphasized the importance of helping preserve what had been built, likening it to placing a lightning rod on a house. It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> would come to talk to President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> about the specific requirements for river patrol craft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> felt that some, if not all, 50 boats could be procured from surplus or re-programming. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> emphasized that military assistance had not been placed on his schedule, which focuses on economic development, but he could not fail to stress this threat against his country. He felt that three C-130 and some river craft would assure the security of his country and that this was not asking for military aid but for a contribution to the security of his country. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> left the meeting.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stressed the importance of emphasizing stability when talking to businessmen and Mr. McNamara. They all knew that the Congo is rich, and the greatest incentive to investment is its stability and the confidence that there will be no expropriation and no revolution.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> referred to the explosive situation of the Near East and the growing Soviet presence in the Mediterranean and northern Africa. Did President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> feel that this posed a threat to Central Africa for the future? President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> responded that the threat was very real, the line goes from the Mediterranean to Algiers, Tripoli, Cairo, Khartoum and now the <gloss target="#t_CAR1">CAR</gloss> which is the Congoʼs neighbor. He was for peace and the Rogers Plan, but it would be very sad if Israel were placed in a weakened posture. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stressed that the balance of forces must not be disrupted. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> stressed the assistance his country had received from Israel. He stood firmly behind Israel at all international gatherings. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> could convince some of the other <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> leaders of the existence of the danger. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> replied that he was distressed by the fact that some U.S. diplomats and U.S. special agencies representatives said that there was no communist danger in Africa today. The President could look at the number of countries which used to vote against Chicom admission in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and who had now fallen into its orbit. Because of its standing the Congoʼs voice was not neglected. After its recovery it tried to help other countries but its means were limited. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> knew how costly it was to be leader of the free world. The Congo was trying to do the same for the free African countries.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> wanted to know how the efforts of U.S. diplomacy throughout the world and of Congo diplomacy in Africa could be harmonized so that we could save what could still be saved. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> felt that the most important thing was to work together and see that a country like the Congo was able to defend itself. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> remarked that he was impressed by the fact that President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> was not asking for spectacular and showy weapons but for what he needed for defense; some river craft and C-130s. He felt it was important also for his voice to be heard for some of the new leaders in Africa might feel there was no danger. In his trip here President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> would have a chance to talk about this, although not over-stating it, and show that Africa wants to develop without communist domination, and without capitalist domination, following its own path. A modest defense force was essential. This was President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs philosophy and we could subscribe to it.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wanted his visitor to know that in the President of the U.S. he had a man who understood the problems of his country and who was his personal friend. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> thanked the President and said he hoped the President would help influence American investors to invest in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stressed that a direct channel of communication to him personally was available to President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. He said that it was important that he had been the first U.S. President to visit Africa before taking office, and that he planned to be the first President to visit Africa while in office. President Mobutu said that he would have to come to the Congo.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> also raised the question of supporting the GRAI because if the other Angolese movement took over it would be very dangerous for the Congo. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said that he understood the importance of the situation and would be talking to the Portuguese possibly within the next six months and would take the matter up with them. President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> felt that the GRAI ought to be encouraged by the Portuguese and perhaps the Portuguese ought to make a start and open negotiations with them.</p>

                        <p>The Department of Defense will have to me by 9:00 tomorrow morning a letter of authorization on the sale of three C-130ʼs. It has got to be a cash deal, but <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> said five times “Je suis prepare acheter.” I have put the arm on Defense for two things which can serve to illustrate the warmth of our Presidentʼs regard. First, waiver of the 2% charge on quality control. It amounts to $300 thousand, most of which is not actually out of pocket. The second is waiver of the R&amp;D cost, in this case $48 thousand, none of which is out of pocket. I have got Defense moving in this direction but you will probably get a call tomorrow morning from Dick Ware or <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Warren Nutter</persName> to confirm that this is what the President wants. Please tell them yes.</p>
                        <p>There is no problem about Presidential determination under Conte-Long. If <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is really prepared to pay for these aircraft, we will have everything done before he leaves town tomorrow, including expediting delivery.</p>

                        <p>Mobuto Visit. In line with your instructions I met with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> privately to discuss his security needs. He stressed the need for quick action on two things: his desire to buy 3 C-130s, and his need for maritime patrol craft on Lake Tanganyika. In <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs presence, I charged <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">MARSHALL WRIGHT</persName> of my staff with the task of working out both problems prior to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs departure from the <lb/>United States on the 15th.</p>

                            <item>Zaire President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> Warming Up To Soviets</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>President Mobutu Sese Seku of Zaire has decided to have friendlier and closer relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Eastern European socialist states. He recently received Ceausescu of Romania on a state visit, and in an unprecedented gesture of warmth, invited the Soviet Ambassador to lunch. Other steps, such as exchanges of high level visits between Kinshasa and Moscow, are expected soon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs flirtation with the “safer” socialist countries like Romania and Yugoslavia is nothing new. He has utilized his relationships with these countries in the past to help project a non-aligned image. You will recall that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> visited Bucharest and Belgrade immediately after his official visit to the US in August 1970. But what is new is <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs initiative toward the Soviet Union which can be attributed to the following underlying motives.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> ejected the Soviets twice since 1960 because of their political machinations against him. He is still distrustful, but believes he can handle them. He feels he is at the zenith of his personal power, and has sufficient confidence in his intelligence apparatus to consider himself virtually invulnerable to plotting. He calculates, therefore, that the potential benefits outweigh the potential dangers.</p>
                        <p>2. Zaireʼs financial and budgetary situations will remain precarious from the present through 1975 when new mines begin producing. Copper prices are weak, import requirements are high, and political patronage costs are constantly inflating. The <pb n="2" xml:id="d238-02" facs="d238-02"/>Government is borrowing heavily from US and European commercial banks. Supplier credits are being requested for all major purchasers. The Soviets are now viewed as a major source of untapped assistance.</p>
                        <p>3. If <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> fears anyone these days, he fears the Peopleʼs Republic of China. Peking radio beamed to Africa lists <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> as running dog number one. His intelligence net in east Africa talks of expanding Chinese influence on his borders. While <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> under-stands the American opening toward Peking, it still makes him uneasy from the optic of his own security. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>ʼs fear of Peking, and Moscowʼs opposition to the expansion of Chinese influence in Africa fit in nicely with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs own concerns about security.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> has been meticulous about keeping us informed of his initiatives. He has reassured us that his actions are carefully calculated and that all safe-guards are in operation. He has reiterated previous assurances that Zaire has special relationships only with the US and Belgium. In short, these are the only two governments he considers trustworthy.</p>
                        <p>From the point of view of US interests, we always feel a higher degree of safety on <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>ʼs behalf when the Soviets are kept safely behind Embassy walls in Kinshasa. But their emergence was inevitable in this day of hard economic and political realities. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is better prepared now than at any previous time to handle subversion. If the Soviets make any false moves in their search for instant gratification, we can be certain that Mobutu will clamp down hard.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Ugandaʼs President, A. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Milton Obote</persName>, on his way back from the Singapore Commonwealth Conference, appears to have been overthrown today by a military coup dʼetat. Fighting broke out in Kampala and Jinja in the early hours of January 25. Around 3:15 p.m. Radio Uganda broadcast a statement that a military coalition headed by Major General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName>, Chief of the Defense Staff, and backed by the Commander of the Police, had taken over the government.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear how solid <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs position is. Although the fighting subsided this afternoon, it has reportedly resumed tonight, presumably between <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs forces and those still loyal to the President. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> landed at Nairobi several hours ago and is said to be consulting with Kenyaʼs leaders.</p>
                        <p>There have been no reports of injuries involving Americans or other foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Statements by military spokesmen have attacked <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> for favoring his own Langi tribe and accused him and his followers of getting rich at the expense of the
”common man” while preaching socialism. While the southern Bantu, particularly the Baganda (who have long opposed <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>) do not seem to have been directly involved, they are for the moment at least probably sympathetic with the announced aims of the coup leaders despite an aversion to military rule. These goals include the release of political detainees and an early return to civilian government with free elections.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d240-02" facs="d240-02"/>
                        <p>The military government has called upon ministers and civil servants to return to work, but we do not at the moment know of the wherabouts of most members of <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs Government or whether all the ministers would be acceptable to the new regime. The statements of the new leaders suggest they would seek a government of national unity that might be more conservative than <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs both in national and international issues.</p>

                            <item>Uganda Coup</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. USG is seriously concerned about disruptive effect which coup in Uganda may have in what has been one of most stable areas in Africa, with resultant sharp decline in favorable attitudes which currently exist in this country and elsewhere towards East Africa. US and especially <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> have strong ties in area--cultural, educational, commercial, political--and number American tourists and businessmen traveling to area has steadily risen in recent years. Continued turmoil in East Africa will inevitably lead to sharp drop in tourism and growing reluctance of private firms to invest in <pb n="2" xml:id="d241-02" facs="d241-02"/>area. Obviously such developments could have highly unfavorable effect in economic development and progress of area.</p>
                        <p>2. In view above, Dept would like Embassy to explore with <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> whether any initiative might usefully be taken to avert further deterioration. Request Embassy seek appointment(s) with appropriate FCO officials per <persName corresp="#p_CWBJ1">Carter</persName>/Walker telecon <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss>. We have asked Amb. <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>, who currently in Geneva, to go to London to participate with Embassy representative in these discussions.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to obtaining general FCO reaction re developments in Uganda and neighboring East African countries to date, you should raise following specific points:</p>
                        <p>a) Utility of high-level person acceptable to both sides, preferably African leader (perhaps Kenyatta or other Kenyan) but possibly <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> national of stature of Malcolm MacDonald, mediating between <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d241-03" facs="d241-03"/>with aim of finding solution acceptable to both sides. Realize chances of success probably very slight but believe worth trying if suitable mediator can be found. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> have had close relationship in past and <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has publicly stated <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> is welcome to return to Uganda but not as President. Also said in first press conference <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> not a bad man but misled by people he trusted.</p>
                        <p>b) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assessment of effect of coup and <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs continued presence in Tanzania on future relations among three East African states, and particularly on East African Community.</p>
                        <p>c) In connection above point, desirability of British discussing entire problem with Kenyans to see what action they might be willing to take with both Tanzania and Uganda (<persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> and/or <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>) to assure continuation of effective East African Community and other regional institutions. We assume <gloss target="#t_GOK1">GOK</gloss> attaches <pb n="4" xml:id="d241-04" facs="d241-04"/>considerable importance to holding such institutions together.</p>
                        <p>d) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assessment of <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs support and ability to hold out.</p>
                        <p>e) Any additional thoughts or information re recognition question.</p>

                        <p>2. WHILE I REALIZE I HAVE BEEN OUT OF TOUCH WITH FAST MOVING SITUATION IN KAMPALA AND WASHINGTON I FEEL COMPELLED TO REPORT MY OWN STRONG NEGATIVE REACTION TO PARA. 3 (A) REFTEL FOR FOLLOWING REASONS STATED IN SUMMARY FORM:</p>
                        <p>A) MEDIATION BETWEEN <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> NOT US INTERETS IN UGANDA OR IN OUR INTERESTS REST OF BLACK AFRICA. US INTERESTS UGANDA WILL BE BETTER SERVED BY LESS ”PROGRESSIVE” <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> LIKELY EMERGE UNDER WHOEVER REAL POWER IS. MY GUESS IS ONAMA.</p>
                        <p>(B) OBOTE COULD NOT ACCEPT A <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> MEDIATOR AS WOULD COMPLETELY DESTROY HIS PROGRESSIVE AFRICAN IMAGE. MOREOVER, <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IS PATHOLOGICALLY ANTI-BRITISH, E.G. ON TWO OCCASIONS IT HAS BEEN STATED TO ME THAT HE BELIEVES <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> HAS BEEN OUT TO GET HIM FROM THE BEGINNING INCLUDING BEING BEHIND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. OTHER SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THIS IS SINCERELY HELD BELIEF.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d242-02" facs="d242-02"/>
                        <p>(c) NON <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> MEDIATOR SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE AFTER NIGERA-BIAFRA.</p>
                        <p>(D) THE LIKELIHOOD OF A KENYAN MEDIATOR I BELIEVE IS NIL. I DO NOT BELIEVE AFTER STRAINS OF LAST SIX MONTHS THERE IS SINGLE OFFICIAL KENYAN WHO REGRETS <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName>ʼS DEPARTURE OR WHO WOULD LIFT A FINGER TO AID HIS RETURN IN ANY CAPACITY. MOREOVER, KENYANʼS FUTURE INTERESTS MORE LIKELY SERVE BOTH IF <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> COMPLETELY OUT OF WAY AND WITH ANTI-<persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> GOV IN CHARGE.</p>
                        <p>(E) COMPROMISE WITH <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> IN PICTURE WILL UNDERCUT VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST SYMPATHETIC TO USG AND USG POSITIONS, I.E. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> AND ONAMA.

                        <p>(F) INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN UGANDA CANNOT HELP BUT BE IMPROVED WITH <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> OUT OF PICTURE. UNLIKE RECENT COUPS AFRICA AND SOME LAS, THIS COUP IS FROM RIGHT, NOT FROM
”PROGRESSIVE” LEFT.</p>
                        <p>(G) I BELIEVE COMPROMISE <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss>, GIVEN <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName>ʼS PAST PERFORMANCE IN 1962-66 COMPROMISE <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss>, WILL BE INHERENTLY MORE UNSTABLE AND DISRUPTIVE THAN THE POSSIBILITY UP-COMING WEAK <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> GOV.</p>
                        <p>(H) PROBLEM FUTURE EAC LIES NOT NOW IN UGANDA BUT IN TANZANIA AND THAT PROBLEM IS NYEREREʼS I.E. WHO TO RECOGNIZE. SINCE HE CANNOT DO BOTH, NYERERE IS NOW ONLY ONE IN WHOSE INTEREST IT WOULD BE TO BRING ABOUT A COMPROMISE. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE HE CAN PLAY ROLE DUE TO OBVIOUS PRO-<persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> IDENTIFICATION.</p>
                        <p>(I) FINALLY, BELIEVE THAT MAJOR FRIEND, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, INTERESTS CLEARLY BEST SERVED BY ANY <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> IN WHICH <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> HAS NOT PART.</p>
                        <p>3. I BELIEVE CRUCIAL PROBLEM AND REAL POSSIBILITY IS <pb n="3" xml:id="d242-03" facs="d242-03"/>COUNTER COUP OR INTRA-COUP FROM <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> FOLLOWERS OR OTHER RIVALS FOR POWER WHO HAVE CAPACITY TO GOVERN (WHICH <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> DECIDEDLY HAS NOT). <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>ʼS VERY LACK OF CAPACITY MAKES THIS EVENTUALITY ALMOST CERTAIN. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT AN <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_OAM1">OBOTE</persName> COMPROMISE WOULD IN ANY WAY LESSEN THIS PROBABILITY. INDEED BELIEVE REVERSE IS TRUE.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. While the dust is far from settled on the recent military seizure of power in Uganda, at least a few of its implications are already discernible. As the first coup in Black Africa in over a year, it has aroused more than the normal amount of attention and comment from Black African countries. Further, it marks the downfall of one of the areaʼs more radical heads of state who had just played a noisy role at the Commonwealth Conference in Singapore. But ex-President <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs strong stand against British plans to sell arms to South Africa had little or nothing to do with his loss of power.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d243-02" facs="d243-02"/>
                        <p>2. The coup itself appears to have been a hastily improvised defensive measure taken by Maj-Gen <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName> -- the new head of Uganda -- to counter President <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs effort to oust him. General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has since made the usual charges about tribal favoritism, corruption, economic difficulties and lack of democracy in the previous government --all of which are true -- to justify the takeover. He has also promised eventual return to civilian rule, pledged respect for international treaties, and professed his desire for good relations with practically everyone.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> is regarded as more moderate and pro-Western than <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> but his ability to organize and run an effective government is questionable. The General rose from the ranks and is popular with the troops and many junior officers, but factionalism within the army mirrors the divisions within the country and Uganda -- a congeries of hostile tribes --is difficult to govern under any circumstances.</p>
                        <p>4. It is too early to predict what domestic policy changes the new regime will make or how popular it is likely to be once the euphoria over <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs downfall wears off.
<pb n="3" xml:id="d243-03" facs="d243-03"/>The Baganda -- Ugandaʼs largest and most advanced tribe -- will hope for the power and benefits denied them during their long years in the wilderness under <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>. They will probably be difficult to control and placate. Moreover, the government is in financial trouble, thanks in part to <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs recent lavish spending. At the outset the <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> regime will have few funds with which to meet competing tribal demands. In general, whatever combination of tribal groupings gains ascendancy, internal politics are likely to be even less stable under <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> than under <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. The external ramifications of this coup are surprisingly extensive. Radical African leaders are sharply disappointed at the loss of one of their more vocal and rising stars. For them, this is the most traumatic coup since Nkrumahʼs downfall in 1966. President <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> of Tanzania has publicly denounced <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> as a rebel and asserted that <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> remains the lawful Ugandan president. <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> has given <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> asylum and assisted his campaign to deny recognition of the new regime. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> has visited Kenya and Ethiopia and may be seeking Sudanese military aid. He <pb n="4" xml:id="d243-04" facs="d243-04"/>probably is also looking for sympathy from the Somali and Zambian governments. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs charges of Israeli and other (read British) foreign instigation of <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs coup fall on receptive ears among radical African leaders and will increase their suspicions of the West. But the non-recognition campaign is almost certain to fail.</p>
                        <p>6. Ethiopia appears quietly delighted at this turn of events. It expects Uganda to sympathize with the rebels in southern Sudan and perhaps to aid them. Such pressure on Sudan could, in turn, divert Sudanese attention from Ethiopiaʼs own troubles with the dissidents in Eritrea. Since <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has had fairly close contact with the Israeli military technicians who are training the Ugandan army, the Sudan is probably worried that <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> might permit stepped up Israeli contacts with the rebels. In any event Sudanese-Ugandan relations are likely to be further strained over the next months, and the usual border clashes involving refugees and rebels may increase.</p>
                        <p>7. Perhaps the most serious repercussions of the coup lie in its effects on the fragile East African Community <pb n="5" xml:id="d243-05" facs="d243-05"/>(EAC) -- which provides a common market and common services to Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> usually sided with <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> in intra-EAC disputes and President <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName>ʼs patience was often taxed in the effort to hold the arrangement together. Now that <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> has publicly denounced <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> and harbours <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>, the whole structure is endangered, along with hopes of broadening the community to include neighboring countries. On the other hand, the service functions of the EAC -- transport and communications --could easily be maintained even if the heads of government refuse to speak to one another.</p>
                        <p>8. Kenya disapproves of military coups, partly because they can be contagious, yet it is pleased to see <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> re-placed by someone more to its liking. If <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs conciliatory attitude towards Tanzania continues and <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> accepts some face-saving excuse to resume relations with Uganda, the power balance in the EAC is still likely to be in Kenyaʼs favor. If <persName corresp="#p_NJK1">Nyerere</persName> remains adamant, Kenya and Uganda could maintain effective ties but the EAC would be in for some very rough <pb n="6" xml:id="d243-06" facs="d243-06"/>sledding. In any event, Tanzania and Zambia, the remaining radicals in the area, are likely to draw closer together.</p>
                        <p>9. The coup will probably have little affect on Ugandaʼs or East Africaʼs relations with countries abroad. <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs nationalization program is likely to be slowed or stopped -- but not reversed. Uganda may get along a bit better with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and with the US; a bit worse with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China. But the main impact of the coup will be confined to Eastern Africa, where the gulf is widening between moderates and radicals.</p>

USG encouraged by evidence that, with exception Tanzania, countries initially most active in backing <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> now appear to be moving more cautiously. We continue believe moderate African states, particularly Congo(K), Ethiopia and Kenya, can be most effective in fostering acceptance new <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> if latter not too <pb n="2" xml:id="d245-02" facs="d245-02"/>closely identified with non-African powers. USG therefore particularly desires avoid any formal actions on eve February 26 <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Ministerial Meetinq in Addis Ababa.</p>
                        <p>3. At same time, we agree with Embassy that we should make clear to new Ugandan Government that USG welcomes its gestures of friendship and looks forward to carrying on diplomatic relations in fullest sense at earliest appropriate moment. USG position this regard clear from press statement (ref B).</p>
                        <p>4. Subject your further views, suggest you seek appointment <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Kibedi to convey essence above and say you instructed to review orally with him and other appropriate <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> officials such outstanding matters as Lincoln School problem, National War College visit, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> participant trainees, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> project agreements and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> bilateral so that agreements <pb n="3" xml:id="d245-03" facs="d245-03"/>can be concluded following <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> meeting when we assume African attitudes towards <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> will have been satisfactorily resolved. (Presume Embassy has now received approved bilateral text forwarded AIDTO A-4, Jan. 21.)</p>
                        <p>5. Department also plans, prior <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> meeting, to seek appropriate occasion in Addis Ababa, Kinshasa and Nairobi to advise respective governments of USGʼs position on relations with <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>IN MANNER YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE REQUEST YOU DISCUSS WITH GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> OUR VIEWS HIS SEVERAL PROPOSALS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                        <p>1. SEVERAL REQUESTS REPORTED KAMPALA REFTELS FROM GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> PUT USG AT THIS TIME IN DIFFICULT POSITION. WE DESIRE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO OVERTURES OF FRIENDSHIP. AT SAME TIME WE AVOID DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN PRIMARILY AFRICAN ISSUES AND IN ACTIONS CONCERNING SECURITY OF AFRICAN STATES. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO AVOID INVOLVEMENT IN SECESSION PROBLEMS (NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR AND SOUTHERN SUDAN) WHICH PLAGUE AFRICAN STATES AND WE HAVE RESPECTED AFRICANSʼ OPPOSITION TO ANY POSSIBLE BREAK UP OF A FELLOW AFRICAN NATION. MOREOVER WE ARE RESTRAINED BY OUR OWN LAWS AND OUR LIMITED RESOURCES FROM INAUGURATION OF NEW MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OR EVEN, SINCE CONGRESSIONAL AMENDMENT LAST YEAR, FROM OFFERING MILITARY TRAINING IN U.S.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d246-02" facs="d246-02"/>
                        <p>2. GIVEN THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF OUR POLICY, WE CAN NOT RPT NOT GIVE ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SATISFY HIS WISHES FOR U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT UNDER <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> OR FMS. (SEPTEL FOLLOWS.)</p>
                        <p>3. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE HIS NEEDS AND WE APPRECIATE THE PROPOSED ORIENTATION OF HIS NEW GOVERNMENT. WE ARE PREPARED, THEREFORE, IF GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> UNDERSTANDS OUR VERY REAL LIMITATIONS TO INITIATE REQUESTED LIAISON AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD AS WILL BE EXPLAINED MORE FULLY IN SEPTEL. FURTHER, WE PREPARED TO APPROVE COMMERCIAL PURCHASE BY <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> OF TYPES OF DUAL-PURPOSE MILITARY EQUIPMENT EXPLAINED IN ADDITIONAL SEPTEL.</p>
                        <p>4. IN LIGHT SITUATION PARA 2 WE WOULD BE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDING IF <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> FELT IT IMPRUDENT TO MOVE AGAINST SOVIET ADVISORS AT THIS TIME OR TO CUT HIMSELF OFF FROM ACCESS TO SPARES FOR SOVIET ORIGIN MILITARY ITEMS. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> IN BETTER POSITION TO JUDGE THAN WE BUT WE SUGGEST THAT IF SOVIETS HAVE NOT CLEARLY DETERMINED THEIR POSITION TOWARDS HIS REGIME THERE MAY BE MERIT IN AVOIDING ACTION WHICH WOULD LEAD SOVIETS TO ENCOURAGE THOSE IN KHARTOUM OR DAR WHO MIGHT BE ATTRACTED BY EXTREME MOVES AGAINST HIS REGIME.</p>
                        <p>5. APPARENT THAT WHAT NEW UGANDAN GOVERNMENT DOES IS OWN BUSINESS, BUT WOULD SUGGEST THAT <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> REGIME ACCEPTANCE BY MODERATE AFRICAN STATES LIKELY BE CONSIDERABLY MORE DIFFICULT IF IT INITIATES ACTIONS AGAINST ITS NEIGHBORS.</p>
                        <p>6. FINALLY, WE HAVE STRONGEST RESERVATIONS TOWARD ANY EFFORT INVOLVE SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGIMES IN DISPUTES BETWEEN BLACK AFRICAN STATES. WE CANNOT SEE THIS AS BEING HELPFUL EITHER TO AFRICAN STATES INVOLVED OR TO LONGER RANGE EFFORTS REDUCE PROSPECTS VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE-DOMINATED AFRICA.</p>

                        <p>1. Now consider it desirable to continue forward movement toward normalization relations in low-key manner, avoiding public statements. Hope <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> will take similar view matter.</p>
                        <p>2. Suggest that Embassy/USAID now begin move pending ProAgs forward for signature by <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> at appropriate levels. Prefer you start with pending revisions of ProAgs already signed (Toronto Girls School, Agricultural Co-Ops and IPA), following these with new ProAgs. Believe <pb n="2" xml:id="d247-02" facs="d247-02"/>it preferable also to space ProAgs out somewhat; rather than presenting simultaneously. If <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> issues statement on revisions, we would reiterate that we regard revision existing ProAgs as part normal working contacts. At that time could reconsider whether proceed with new ProAgs.</p>
                        <p>3. Among new ProAgs <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/W particularly interested in signature those covering Agricultural Research Survey Team and Makerere Graduate Agriculture Faculty as contractors already contacted and recruitment underway. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Realize-Mission cannot issue Makerere PIO/T until it receives <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/Wʼs comments on proposed OPEX guidelines and final agreement on guidelines reached <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/W comments pouched March 4. In addition, Chief Agricultural Research Officer PIO/T will need revision to bring it in line with new guidelines. END <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. USAID should not include Livestock Production ProAg <pb n="3" xml:id="d247-03" facs="d247-03"/>among first priorities for signature because contract negotiations already underway for other projects and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-71 deobs involved in Livestock ProAg amount. No objection, however, if Mission prepares Livestock ProAg now for possible signature next month.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>DISCUSSION:</p>
                        <p>Since the January 25 military coup in Uganda, we have gradually expanded our working relationship with the new government of General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName> Dada but have made it clear we do not yet regard our relations fully normalized. It had been our intention to follow the African lead. We hoped the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Ministerial Meeting held in Addis Ababa at the end of February would clarify the African position, but the Meeting adjourned without seating the <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> delegation. The issue was instead referred to the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Summit scheduled in June.</p>
                        <p>A considerable time has now elapsed since the coup. The <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> Government is in full control and has promised to honor the international obligations of its predecessor. Moreover, since the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Ministerial Meeting, a growing number of African states, including Congo (K), Ethiopia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, have indicated through remarks or actions--although generally not through formal statements of recognition--that they intend to do business with the <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> Government.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d248-02" facs="d248-02"/>
                        <p>We have a number of matters to carry forward in Kampala. We believe that further delay in normalizing relations is not only unnecessary, but will be resented by the <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> Government. We therefore wish to instruct Ambassador Ferguson to move an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> bilateral and a Development Loan Agreement forward for signature, two actions that will effectively normalize our relations with the new government.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you sign the attached telegram to Kampala.</p>

                        <p>1. After some of ProAgs covered State ref have been finalized, agree that desirable next step will be to obtain <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> agreement on final draft bilateral. If, during your discussions with ForMin and Attorney General, question of signature arises, you can respond that, assuming <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> proposes no further changes US draft, you prepared sign bilateral. Would hope signing could be accomplished with little or no publicity. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: If bilateral is signed, we would be prepared to respond to any queries by saying we consider we have normal relations with <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss>. If <pb n="4" xml:id="d248-04" facs="d248-04"/>pressed if this means we recognize <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss>, we would respond in affirmative without identifying any act or time. END <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Moreover, believe we should also at same time move PTTC loan agreement forward, submitting it to <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> if you have not already done so and indicating USG readiness to sign, again without publicity. <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> should understand that execution loan agreement obligates USG provide only up to $3.2 million for project with <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> to finance remainder. Septel follows on question possible increased costs.</p>
                        <p>3. At appropriate point you should indicate to MinEd and other pertinent officials our hope that <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> will reciprocate USGʼs responsiveness by registering Lincoln School in order to permit its construction program to go forward as soon as possible.<lb/>END</p>

                        <p>1. THE MAJOR THRUST OF UNITED STATES POLICY AND PROGRAMS IN UGANDA IS DEVELOPMENTAL AND HUMANITARIAN. WE ARE THUS COMMITTED TO ASSISTING, IN SELECTED AREAS, UGANDAʼS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. TO THIS END WE HAVE ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR RESOURCES -- OUR AID PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS, OUR CULTURAL EXCHANGES, OUR PEACE CORPS EFFORTS, AND THE PROGRAMS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO RENDER SUCH PROTECTION AS WE CAN TO THE LIMITED AMERICAN BUSINESS INTERESTS IN UGANDA-- INTERESTS WHICH ARE THREATENED VITALLY BY A VOLATILE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND BY A DECIDEDLY DESPERATE ECONOMIC CRISIS.</p>
                        <p>2. THERE IS NOW A CLEAR AND PRESENT RISK THAT OUR POLICY OF ASSISTING IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL BE FRUSTRATED. THE RISK -- PARTICULARLY TO OUR AID PROGRAMS, ARISES NOT SO MUCH OUT OF MALCONCEIVED OR MALADMINISTERED PROJECTS, BUT RATHER ARISES OUT OF THE CHAOTIC STATE OF THE ECONOMY. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS ECONOMIC WEAKNESS IS THE APPARENT MALAPPORTIONMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPENDITURES AS BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL SECTORS. HENCE, OUR ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE COMMITMENTS MAY WELL BE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY LEGISLATIVE PROHIBITIONS (E.G., THE SYMINGTON AMENDMENT).</p>
                        <p>3. THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IS CLEAR. BEFORE MAKING FUTURE COMMITMENTS WE MUST BE SATISFIED BEYOND A <pb n="2" xml:id="d249-02" facs="d249-02"/>REASONABLE DOUBT THAT UGANDA WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DISCHARGE ITS UNDERTAKINGS IN CONNECTION WITH PARTICULAR PROJECTS. MOREOVER, WE MUST ALSO BE SATISFIED THAT PRIORITIES OF EXPENDITURE, AGAIN AS BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND DEVELOPMENTAL SECTORS, REFLECT REALISTIC NEEDS IN BOTH AREAS.</p>
                        <p>4. SIMILARLY, AMERICAN BUSINESS INTERESTS MAY WELL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE ECONOMIC MALAISE. STRINGENT IMPORT AND FISCAL CONTROLS ARE BOUND TO HAMPER BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FRUSTRATE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS. THE GOVERNMENTʼS LOW LEVEL OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES IS BOUND TO IMPEDE NOT ONLY CAPITAL BUT ALSO PROFIT REPATRIATION. MOREOVER, GIVEN SUCH DIRE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE FOR BOTH OLD AND NEW CAPITAL PLACEMENT WILL INEVITABLY BE HIGHLY UNATTRACTIVE.</p>
                        <p>5. THUS, BOTH IN THE FORMULATION OF NEW POLICY, E.G., THE EXPANSION OF U.S. EXPORT MARKETS IN UGANDA, AND IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING POLICIES, WE MUST BE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THE SERVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS-- A CRISIS LIKELY TO BE EXTANT UNTIL AT LEAST 1975-76.</p>
                        <p>6. EVEN AS TO THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRADIT- IONAL FUNCTION OF AN AMERICAN MISSION -- SECURING THE PROTECTION OF THE WELL-BEING OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, WE ARE LIKELY TO FACE VOLATILE AND UNPREDICTABLE GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CONFRONTATIONS. CONSEQUENCES OF THE INQUIRY INTO THE FATE OF STROH AND SIEDLE ARE APT NOT ONLY TO CONTRIBUTE TO TENSIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS, BUT ALSO TO CONTRIBUTE TO POLITICAL STRESSES AND STRAINS WITHIN THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN ONLY BECLOUD THE FUTURE. TO COPE WITH AT LEAST THE PREDICTABLE EVENTUALITIES WILL REQUIRE AN UNUSUALLY DEFT TOUCH.</p>

                        <p>During Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName>ʼs farewell call July 18, President <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> attacked the role of various categories of Americans in Uganda. He accused the United States of sending Israeli agents into Uganda disguised as American tourists, stated that United States tourists are spying on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, alleged that the Peace Corps is ”full of spies”, and declared that he wants all United States and other intelligence personnel out of Uganda. He stated further that he wanted to know the exact number of Americans and the jobs they perform in Uganda so that he could take this into account when he conducts a personal review within the next two weeks of the presence of the United States, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and ”others” in Uganda. Most of the conversation appeared later in the Ugandan press.</p>
                        <p>The Department has instructed our Charge in Kampala to see the Uganda Foreign Minister as soon as possible and to state that we received President <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs comments with considerable distress, that the 133 Peace Corps Volunteers now in the country are specifically enjoined from engaging in intelligence work of any kind, and that we hold the <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> responsible for fair and non-discriminatory treatment of all United States citizens in <pb n="2" xml:id="d250-02" facs="d250-02"/>Uganda.

                        <p>1. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE USG MAINTAIN A STRICT POLICY OF NO PUBLIC COMMENT IN REGARD TO THE ASIAN EXPULSION ACTIVITES OF GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. IN THIS VERY MOVING HUMAN TRAGEDY IT IS PRACTICALLY GUARANTEED THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL EVENTS THAT, LIKE THE PRIMARY ACT ITSELF, WILL BE IN VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. ANY ACTION BY THE USG IN COMMENTING OR TAKING THE LEADERSHIP IN STATEMENTS AND/OR ACTIVITIES CONDEMNING THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE MISINTERPRETED AS AN ACT OF INTERVENTION IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF UGANDA. OUR RELATIONS FOR THE MOMENT ARE FRAGILE AND SUCH AN ACTION WOULD CERTAINLY COMPLICATE THEM. FURTHERMORE ANY SUCH ACTION WOULD PE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.</p>
                        <p>3. LET US HOPE THAT AFRICAN LEADERS WHO DO NOT HESITATE TO TAKE ADVANTAGEOF EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK SOUTH AFRICA AND RHODESIA FOR THEIR VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHO ALSO ATTACK THE US AND <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS WILL HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE THE LEADERSHIP IN ANY UN OR INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO END THE VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS <pb n="2" xml:id="d251-02" facs="d251-02"/>OF ASIANS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES LIVING IN UGANDA. PRESIDENT NYERERE HAS ALREADY SPOKEN, A PROMINENT AFRICAN CHURCH GROUP AND SEVERAL EAST AFRICAN NEWSPAPERS HAVE CRITICIZED SOME ASPECTS OF <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>ʼS EXPULSION ORDER. PERHAPS OTHERS WILL FOLLOW AND TAKE THE MATTER TO THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. IF THEY DO, THIS WILL HELP TO RESTORE THE PRESTIGE OF THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> IN AMERICA AND WESTERN EYES BECAUSE THE PAST DECADE IT SEEMS THAT THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> WILL ONLY ATTACK WESTERN COUNTRIES BUT DOES NOT DARE TO LOOK INTO THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OCCURRING IN NON-WESTERN COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>4. ONE WAY FOR US TO HELP ASIANS -- IF A DECISION IS TAKEN TO DO THIS -- WOULD BE TO FIND AN ARAB LEADER WHO, LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF SUDAN, COULD APPROACH <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>. I DO NOT RPT NOT RECOMMEND THAT WE DO THIS. WE ARE CUL- TIVATING OUR EMBASSY CONTACTS WITH THE SUDANESE AND LIBYANS FOR FUTURE USE WHEN THE NEED ARISES. WE WANT TO PRESERVE WHATEVER CREDITS WE HAVE TO SERVE MORE CONCRETE BILATERAL CONCERNS.</p>
                        <p>5. I FEEL BEST EFFORTS WE COULD MAKE ON HUMANITARIAN SIDE, WITHOUT ILL EFFECT TO OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS, WOULD BE, IN LINE WITH STATE 154457, PARA 3, TO OFFER SPECIAL IMMIGRATION TO SMALL GROUP OF EXPELLEES WHO WILL BE, FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, STATELESS. I CAN ASSURE. YOU THAT THIS GESTURE -- HOWEVER NOMINAL -- WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED BY THE BRITISH AND INDIAN HIGH COMMISSIONS IN KAMPALA AND I WOULD BELIEVE ALSO BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS.</p>
                        <p>6. I HAVE ASKED ALL MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY AND ALL AGENCIES -- USAID, USIS AND PEACE CORPS --TO REFRAIN FROM MAKING ANY REMARKS ON THE ASIAN EXPULSION ORDER TO ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE US OFFICIAL FAMILY. WE ARE REGARDING IT AS AN INTERNAL MATTER, ALTHOUGH ALL OF US ARE DEEPLY MOVED BY THE DAILY MANIFESTATIONS OF INHUMANITY.</p>

WE WOULD WISH TO REFLECT OUR CONCERN AND REGRET ABOUT ANY SITUATION WHERE HUMAN BEINGS ARE SUDDENLY UPROOTED AND DISPLACED.

SUCH A STATEMENT FREE OF INVECTIVE WHICH EXPRESSES OUR GENERAL CONCERN WHILE STRESSING POSITIVE ASPECTS FLOWING FROM <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>ʼS HAVING MODIFIED HIS PREVIOUS POSITION COULD ALSO, WE WOULD HOPE, ENCOURAGE HIM TO EASE PRESSURES FURTHER.</p>

                        <p rend="center">UGANDA<lb/>(Population: 10 million)</p>
                        <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>On January 25, 1971, General Idi Amin overthrew President <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Milton Obote</persName> of Uganda. This triggered a purge of <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs tribal kinsmen in the army and eventually led to the ouster or death of nearly all non-commissioned officers in the security forces. As a result, an unruly army has terrorized the country.</p>
                        <p>General Armin himself is uneducated, irresponsible, paranoiac and racist. He has ordered the expulsion of 55, 000 non-Ugandan Asians. He earlier expelled the Israelis in order to please the Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> now thinks the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Israel and at times, the US, want his overthrow. The anti-Israeli aspect has become increasingly intense and adds a dangerous focus in the situation.</p>
                        <p>The present fighting began on September 17, when several hundred <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> supporters, who had taken refuge in Tanzania, attacked <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs forces in southern Uganda. This was expected to lead to a popular rising against <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> but did not.</p>
                        <p>2. HUMAN TOLL</p>
                        <p>There have possibly been 4, 000 to 5, 000 tribal killings (<persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName> supporters) since <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> came to power. Casualty figures for the latest fighting are unknown but they do not exceed a few hundred.</p>
                        <p>3. FORCES INVOLVED</p>
                        <p>a. Internal. Amin is strictly a domestic product. He has had little more than vocal support from the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>b. African</p>
                        <p>-- Tanzania clearly favors <persName corresp="#p_OAM1">Obote</persName>ʼs supporters and has armed them.<lb/>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d255-02" facs="d255-02"/>-- Libya has promised financial aid to Uganda, but, so far, none seems to have materialized.<lb/>-- Most Africans consider <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> to be mad.</p>
                        <p>c. Non-African</p>
                        <p>-- Neither the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nor PRC are behind Ugandaʼs problems.<lb/>-- The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has maintained its important economic assistance notwithstanding <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs actions against them. They fear what termination of their aid would do to their 7, 000 nationals.</p>
                        <p>4. OUTLOOK</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> is riding high after having repulsed the Obote invaders. He may try to take revenge on the Asians or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, whom he blames for the invasion. Economically, the country is almost bankrupt and the expulsion of Asians is bound to make matters worse.</p>
                        <p>5. UNITED STATES ROLE</p>
                        <p>a. Interests. Our interests there are negligible but we have traditionally aided Uganda in order to foster East African stability.</p>
                        <p>b. Safety of Americans. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has said that Europeans (i.e., whites) would make good targets for his army if an attempt is mace to unseat him. Such an attempt was just made, but foreigners did not suffer unduly. One Peace Corpsman died near the area of hostilities but this was accidental. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs repeated threats against Europeans are real and no one can assume this irrational man might not act violently against Americans. As a result, State is trying to bring in US personnel from the countryside to Kampala. After this is accomplished, a partial evacuation from Kampala will be considered.</p>
                        <p>c. Future Plans. Preparation of evacuation program.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d255-03" facs="d255-03"/>
                        <p>6. ACTION RECOMMENDED</p>
                        <p>a. Instruct the African <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Interdepartmental Group to prepare a contingency study on an urgent basis which would focus on:</p>
                        <p>(1) recommendations for the withdrawal of Americans from Uganda;<lb/>(2) the termination of assistance programs there, in a way which would not further endanger our people;<lb/>(3) responses to a deteriorating situation resulting in reprisals against non-Africans (whites -- possibly including US but more likely <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> citizens -- and Asians);<lb/>(4) actions in the event the <gloss target="#t_GOU1">GOU</gloss> refused to allow US or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> citizens to depart;<lb/>(5) responses in the event the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> asks for help in evacuating its citizens (7, 000) or Asians, or both.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I donʼt want to irritate your evening, but I was not satisfied with the report on Uganda, which came from State.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Now, the man we have there is <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Melady</persName>, who is a sweet guy. Heʼs a great supporter of ours, but totally African, all African. He doesnʼt understand. Now, I know him--Tom <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Melady</persName>--know him well. Second point, I want harder action taken. I want all--everybody from America evacuated as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I want hard action. And second, I want to get that Burundi Ambassadorʼs ass out of there right now and thatʼs an order.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That should be--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Now, goddamanit--</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That will be ordered today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Now we--I think you will agree, Henry, we have really had a double standard on this thing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, sure.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: In the African Division, you know what I mean, do we care when they kill a poor goddamned Pakistani? Do we care when these damn Africans eat 100,000 people? I mean, itʼs really gone too far. What do you think?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I couldnʼt agree more.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: All right. Will you get on Tom about it? Now <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Melady</persName>ʼs report saying, he said, “Well, no Americans have been arrested and there are a few <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>ʼs have been killed. Goddamnit, if a Britisher killed--I mean call Melady back for instructions. You know? Letʼs call him right back. How about that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can do both of those.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: All right. You get Meladyʼs ass right back here.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the meeting, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> handed over to Ambassador Cromer the Presidentʼs letter to Prime Minister Heath [Tab A] thanking him for the courtesies extended to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on his recent visit to London.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Here is the letter. And a copy for you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Thatʼs very nice. What I want to talk to you about is entirely on my own initiative. I have absolutely no instructions on this. When the President saw Sir Burke Trend [July 28], it was agreed that if ever anything came up with any political overtones on the money side, we should raise it. I want to mention this Schweitzer business. As you know, Schultz more or less blocked his reappointment. Of course youʼre quite entitled to do this. Volcker went and told him, and was then spreading the word.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He ran afoul of Connally.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: And Volcker is continuing this and is being more Connally than Connally. <pb n="2" xml:id="d257-02" facs="d257-02"/>As I say, youʼre entitled to take the position you want. I am concerned that the manner in which you went about it may hurt the atmosphere for the reform we want.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought Schultz was going to see him.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: The less developed countries, for example, Iʼm afraid are now going to portray him as a hero. There will be a lot of speeches at the forthcoming meeting. There was a “secret” meeting yesterday of the less developed countries -- which I heard about -- in which the delegates here were in fact discussing proposing to their governments that they take this line. You know I will be seeing Schultz today.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: To see a speech heʼs giving this week. Yes. Please call me, Rowley, and give me your honest opinion of it. What he is instructed to do is give a general framework, with some specifics, but not on a confrontation basis. ʼWe thought that having no American position at all would be even more unsettling.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Yes. As I say, Iʼm saying this completely without instructions. Just to warn you about what I think is coming.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Itʼs perfectly all right. Youʼre not asking us to do anything.</p>
                        <p>And call me about the speech. I canʼt stop it but perhaps I can moderate it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: In London you mentioned to Burke a new formula you had for presentation to the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Here it is. The statement I made and the new formula we presented. [Hands over U.S. proposals and opening statement from September 15 Paris meeting.]</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: This is very top secret, of course.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d257-03" facs="d257-03"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, because our Secretary of State doesnʼt even know we made a presentation, let alone what it contains.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Clive Rose is coming over to talk about SALT with <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>. You said at one point you might see him. Do you want to?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you think? I leave it to you. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> doesnʼt admit that when heʼs through thereʼs any reason for me to do anything.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Letʼs do it this way: If anything is unresolved after he meets with <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>, I shall ask for an appointment.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, if you request it, Iʼll do it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: My Secretary of State is, of course, delighted with the Presidentʼs kind invitation. He would also like a quiet word with you, perhaps before dinner.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After dinner might be better.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Heʼll be leaving late in the evening.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then before dinner is fine. How about 7:30, here? Ambassador Cromer: Fine.</p>
                        <p>We have some news on this Uganda business. Itʼs absolute hell.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As you know, weʼre moving to take some of your people.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Yes, that marvelous. The news is that it was deteriorating quite badly yesterday but it is better today. But weʼll face the problem of taking care of the British -- the real British. The problem is to get them from the country to the airport.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What can we do?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: We donʼt know what to propose! It was interesting that a Libyan plane carrying arms to Amin tried to overfly the Sudan. The Sudanese forced them to land and took the arms! <pb n="4" xml:id="d257-04" facs="d257-04"/>They made a very robust statement. This is the first major reverse the Libyans have suffered. It may be the only healthy outcome of this.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If you have to consider strong measures, you wonʼt get into trouble with us, to put it mildly.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: Weʼre in touch with State on this.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The President is in a mood to be much tougher than State. He has been thinking of pulling back our Ambassador. What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: That would be a mistake. Weʼre more evil in their eyes than you are. For you to pull out now would be interpreted by <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>, who is a madman, as part of a conspiracy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will look with favor on anything you have to do. What can we do?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cromer: I donʼt know. There are eight American Jews there that State is particularly concerned about.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On these statements, I gave you, there are two things. This is about as far as we are going to go. We may play around with the cosmetics, but it is as far as we can go. They are exceptionally confidential, I have to repeat. We havenʼt given this to anyone else. If the North Vietnamese ever found out we gave this to you . . . . My impression of the North Vietnamese is that they are eager to settle and afraid to settle at the same time. They are eager to settle but donʼt know how to do it. They are clumsy.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Sure. Weʼll have them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Theyʼve tried it earlier this week and State has turned them down--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Screw State! Stateʼs always on the side of the blacks. The hell with them!</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I knew this would be your reaction--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, I just canʼt understand why we havenʼt had them before. You know, like that thing on Burundi.</p>
                        <p>Now I want Stateʼs ass reamed out on that for not--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: --for not--Henry, in the whole Burundi business--Iʼve been watching it in, in the press. Did you know, State has not sent one memorandum over to us on it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Or have they? Have there--or have you had something that I havenʼt seen?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no. They have not.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, how do you feel about it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well I--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Donʼt you really feel--I mean, and just be--letʼs be totally honest. Isnʼt a person a person goddammit? You know, there are those that, you know, they talk about Vietnam, these people far away that we donʼt know. And you remember that poor old Chamberlain talk about the Czechs. That they were far away, and “we donʼt know them very well.” Well now, goddammit, people are people in my opinion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, itʼs not only that--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I donʼt mean our national interests gets involved. But every time, every time that anybody else gets involved--you know, every time that--one other individual or us, and you have a little pressure group here, State goes up the wall. But Iʼm getting tired of this business of letting these Africans eat a hundred thousand people and do nothing about it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And itʼs--and when they have--and all these, these bleeding hearts in this country who say we like to kill yellow people--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Thatʼs right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have--there hasnʼt been as many killed in the eight years of the war as were killed in three months in Burundi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Henry, the whole point is--and also--well itʼs, itʼs the thing that Agnew stuck to [laughter], stuck to McGovern where Agnew pointed out--now, now theyʼre talking about how many we have bombed in the North. And Iʼve told your staff to get the figures for me. How many, how many South Vietnamese or anti-communist North Vietnamese have been killed by the North Vietnamese government? Civilians--how many? Itʼs unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thatʼs right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Nobody gives a damn.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thatʼs right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And, and thatʼs what itʼs--they, theyʼre involved in. I know what the Uganda thing is. What it is--itʼs just like Burundi. The State--Newsomʼs attitude--the attitude of State is to be for whatever black government is in power. Is my--right or wrong?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One hundred percent right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And that was--and that, basically Henry, was the problem on Nigeria. Now frankly, I was on the side of the Biafras then. Not just--not because of Catholics. And you were too. Not because of Catholics but-- State was on the side of the Nigerian government. Why? Because they said, well, “all the other governments would come apart.” Well frankly, Iʼm almost to the opinion myself--and this is far down the road, we need a new African policy. But first of all, we shouldnʼt have 42 ambassadors to these goddamn countries. In the second place--I mean, you know, at the same level as anybody else--in the second place, my own view is that some federations down there are what are needed, or something. I donʼt know. But, but we can talk about that later. But at the present time, looking at Uganda, of course weʼve got to help those 7,000 people. I asked <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> about this when we met with <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: You--were you there?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, I was there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well you remember, I said, “what about this?” He said, “well weʼve got a plan to evacuate the Americans.” Well now, thatʼs a fine howdy do. What the hell are the damn British going to do? 7,000 of them. Theyʼll be murdered.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, what, the way--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Isnʼt that really the problem or not?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is exactly the problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And, and the British are in the bush. All of ours are in Entebbe. And actually, they havenʼt turned against ours so much yet, but they--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --have turned against the British.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: No. I understand.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, who--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --I would recommend, Mr. President--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --that in order to keep this thing from turning into a, a huge leak, is that--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --to send a Defense Department man over--a civilian, not a military guy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, weʼve got anybody we can trust?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, that can even leak, if necessary, and say all heʼs empowered to discuss is the logistics -</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --in--if there has to be a joint evacuation. Now, no one can blame us for that. Then we can tell the British we can use that as a base. If they have further requests, to take them up here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, good. Good. Let me, let me, let me put it another way. Why donʼt we have Goodpastor, from his place--I mean, just go over and, and--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But I worry--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: --and put it at a--I donʼt care whether itʼs at a high level. You mean youʼd--theyʼd start killing, is that it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: One is, they might start killing. Second, we might get a tremendous uproar that we are planning a military campaign.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Okay. Okay.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: While we can achieve most of it by using--in fact, we can achieve all of it--and we can alert Goodpastor to start looking to his assets. That we can do on an independent--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Well, I think you should take--tell Goodpastor--look, NATOʼs sitting over there on its ass doing nothing anyway. Why donʼt we tell Goodpastor to, to get all the assets for the purpose of evacuation that we can have? Right?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: In other words, NATO assets. Letʼs let the NATO countries do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think thatʼs a good idea. We can get Goodpastor to pay a visit. He--itʼs--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I just kind of feel thatʼs a good idea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, he can pay it a NATO visit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: A NATO visit. Right. And then tell him in confidence that I want him to discuss this matter of assets with him. You know, Goodpastor will love having something to do. Howʼs that sound to you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that--well, I--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah, and then, and then send the defense man too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Weʼll send the defense man so thatʼs the--thatʼs the overt--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: What man do you have in mind?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, somebody out of <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>ʼs [unclear]. I thought we, we would pick a low-key guy. Just to get the facts. Right now we donʼt even have the facts--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Could we get--how about somebody--well, why donʼt we--better still, why donʼt we just have somebody from your office go over who knows these people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, Iʼm--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Youʼre afraid that weʼll--that Iʼll get in it then, huh?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, Iʼm afraid in--with the campaign going on--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think the major thing now is to get information, but Goodpastorʼs an excellent idea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: No reason why he canʼt, can--is there?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. Thatʼs an excellent thought.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: You see, the problem is that if we, that--I agree, that if we get in it theyʼll say weʼre trying to get it. But, on the other hand, we have got to, weʼve got to be prepared to help the British. We canʼt have a British slaughter down there. The British have got enough problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely, and itʼs a--it would be a disgrace anyway.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Have they asked [unclear]?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, they sent a personal message to you at midnight last night because they--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --were stonewalled by the State Department all week--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --asking whether we could start some secret technical talks in London.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And thatʼs what I think we should respond to. I like this Goodpastor idea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah, why donʼt you, why donʼt you on our private channel get a hold of them and say that Goodpastor will be paying a NATO visit, but that he has private instructions from me to discuss on a secret basis what the hell we can do. Howʼs that sound to you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That sounds excellent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And, and then you call Andy and you say, “Now Andy, youʼve got to deny this. This conversation never took place. But by god, we--weʼre not going to let these people be destroyed by these people.” Letʼs do that. Thatʼll reassure the British. They just want to know privately what weʼre--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Actually, I could meet Andy in Paris and give it to him orally. That would--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Very good. Very good. But you could let--you should let the British know that weʼve talked about it, and that Goodpastor thing. And then you--if you want to send the defense guy, you can. Only thing is--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think you should send somebody overt.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah. All right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Because then we--thatʼs the--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Overt weʼll say for the purpose of evacuating Americans and British.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Isnʼt it awful though what these--that this Goddamn guy at the head of Uganda, Henry, is an ape.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Heʼs an ape without education.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Thatʼs probably no disadvantage. I mean that--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: [laughter]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I mean, you figure that that asshole that was the head of Ghana had a brilliant education in the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Thatʼs right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I mean, so, letʼs face it--no, no, what I mean is heʼs, heʼs--he really is. Heʼs a, heʼs a prehistoric monster.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: But, but the same with Burundi. But can--I really, really got to shake up the Africa--while all the departments--but the Africa department at State, Henry, is a disgrace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, the whole--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: When I receive those--you know, I receive ambassadors. All I receive is Africa--three out of four every time are African ambassadors. Theyʼre nice little guys, and so forth and so on, but they donʼt add anything.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I mean, it--and, and State just treats them--I mean, what, what do you think theyʼre up to? What is our African policy? Will you tell me?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our African policy--I just took a paragraph out of a speech--<persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> was happy to accept this, no disrespect to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. But this guy Patterson had two paragraphs in the--in Rogerʼs U.N. speech--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --which was an all-out attack on South Africa--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: No sir.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --on Mozambique--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Never. Never.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --and they are anti-white in Africa. They are, they are obsessively liberal. But you donʼt hear them say a peep --you, you know, when one of these governments is, is not fully democratic that they donʼt like, they scream. But when they murder people in Burundi, when thereʼs--get a fellow in, in Uganda has a reign of terror, you donʼt ever get a protest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah. Now, on, on Burundi, State underestimated, and I know that your people were using it. Do you use the figure 100,000? I understand itʼs 200,000. Now I want the Belgian ambassador--do you know him? Here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I, Iʼve met him, I donʼt know--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Heʼs a decent fellow?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Heʼs a decent guy. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: All right. I want you or--youʼre the one to do it. You call him in, and--itʼd be a very nice touch anyway--and just say, “on a private basis, weʼd like to note your estimate of what the hellʼs happened in Burundi.” I really want to know. I donʼt mean thereʼs anything weʼre going to do about it. Nothing is going to come out of it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we ought to know it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: But, but you know, letʼs get it from the Belgians. Donʼt you agree?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree completely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I mean, the--on this one, though--now that you mention Patterson, heʼs one thatʼs going to go the day after the election. That son-of-a-bitch has done things in--I mean heʼs--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Itʼs an intolerable situation. Every time we want to do something we have to worry how we can finagle it --</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: --so that it doesnʼt leak. Now weʼve got another month where weʼve got to put up with it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Thatʼs all. Well youʼll do this then--</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Immediately.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: And donʼt you think that--who, who will you call? Youʼll call Burke Trend or?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Iʼll first call Cromer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Cromer. Oh yeah. Okay. Well heʼs--heʼll keep it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Heʼll keep it. Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Because he delivered the message.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Call Cromer. Thatʼs the better way to do it anyway. Tell him to pass it to the - that Iʼm outraged by the whole damn thing. That naturally weʼve got to handle it in a very discreet way. And that weʼre going to do it two ways. Weʼre going to send Andy over on a, on a official visit, and that the British should - for discussion of NATO problems. And that weʼre going to send a defense guy over overtly. Right?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Africa]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: But anyway, this is good. Iʼm glad--I think itʼs good to let the British know weʼre going to help. Then, you might give the Belgian ambassador a call and say, “Donʼt, donʼt report this but that the president wants to know what the hell went on and for him--set it up for when, for Wednesday or Thursday of next week. Would you do it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I shall certainly do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I want to know what happened in Burundi. And I want the real cold-cock on that. Just, just you know, for future reference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Because in these African governments and the rest, the idea that weʼre going to stand still on the ground that any African government that was--overthrew a colonial power thereby becomes lily white by our, by our standards and thereby beyond criticism is ridiculous. This damn double standard is just unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Out of the question.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to bring you up to date on what is happening in Uganda and what actions we and others have taken. The nature of our future relations with Uganda is presently being reviewed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Melady</persName> has been brought back from Uganda in order to participate in that review and as soon as it is completed I will submit recommendations for your approval.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">1. Tribalism at its Worst</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since his assumption of power in January, 1971, General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName> has been destroying the elite of all tribes not allied or belonging to his own grouping. The judiciary, top civil servants, academics, the limited professional class and senior army and police officers have been <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs targets. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has not had to eliminate whole tribes to insure his control; he has simply eliminated their leadership with little regard for the consequences of wiping out the economic and intellectual backbone of the country.</p>
                        <p>There are no reliable estimates of deaths. They most probably number several thousand but not above 10, 000 in a population of 10 mil-lion. This compares with over 100, 000 deaths in Burundi where the population was 3. 5 million.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> succeeds, his West Nile tribal kinsmen, who represent between 5 and 10% of the countryʼs population, would rule the country. The ill-fated invasion of Uganda by Tanzanian-backed Ugandan dissidents has greatly strengthened <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> and accelerated the elimination of any opposition to him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">2. The Asian Expulsion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs expulsion of Asians is moving apace. Most non-Ugandan Asians should be out of the country by the November 8 deadline. These appear to number 25, 000 to 30, 000, which is far less than earlier <pb n="2" xml:id="d261-02" facs="d261-02"/>estimates of 55, 000 expellees. Furthermore, Asians are not being brutalized as they were in the initial stages of the expulsion, probably because of the worldʼs outcry, which included many African leaders.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">3. Europeans and Americans in Uganda</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As security deteriorated in Uganda, the number of Europeans and Americans resident there declined from an estimated 11, 000 in September to 7, 800. Our own presence went from 1, 000 to about 700; all of our 114 Peace Corps volunteers were withdrawn. The British went from an estimated 7, 000 to 5, 000 citizens.</p>
                        <p>The safety of Europeans and Americans does not appear to be a problem right now. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has resorted to expelling those foreigners he dislikes and otherwise, has told his troops to lay off whites, whose services the country still needs. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> has gone out of his way lately to be friendly to the United States and West Germany, in the hope that we will respond with aid. (For all practical purposes, US aid to Uganda is presently suspended although we have not stopped on-going technical assistance. This subject is now under review.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">4. The Soviet and Arab Presence</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereas most everyone else -- excluding the French, whose presence has remained at about 200 -- has reduced its presence, our Embassy in Kampala expects the Soviet presence to rise above the present 125. This could result in Sino-Soviet competition between the Soviet-backed <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> versus the Chinese-supported Nyerere of Tanzania. It is too early to speculate on this subject.</p>
                        <p>In addition, a Libyan contingent (possibly 400 men) remains in Uganda. Both the Egyptians and Libyans have promised <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> assistance, which can only anger Nyerere, who, up to now, has blindly supported the Arab cause against Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">5. Future Actions by <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>
                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Assuming <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> will remain in power, and both State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> so believe, it seems likely that <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> will continue to purge Ugandaʼs elite along tribal lines. He is also expected to pursue Africanization programs which will include the takeover of businesses vacated by <pb n="3" xml:id="d261-03" facs="d261-03"/>Asians as well as probable future nationalizations affecting the British. Foreign missionaries will probably also come under increasing scrutiny by <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">6. US Interests</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our own interests in Uganda are limited to protecting our remaining citizens and maintaining a presence in Uganda, rather than giving free rein to the Soviets, assuming they-are responsive to <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>. However, if aid is a prerequisite for a presence, we may not be able to stay in Uganda. This will, of course, be more thoroughly reviewed in the paper for you which will discuss our future policy. This paper should be ready in mid-November.</p>

                        <p>WHAT IS NOW OCCURRING IN UGANDA IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE UGANDAN ELITE: THE JUDICIARY, THE TOP CIVIL SERVANTS, THE ACADEMICS, A LIMITED PROFESSIONAL CLASS, AND THE SENIOR ARMY AND POLICE OFFICERS WHO DO NOT COME FROM A WEST NILE TRIBE. THEY ARE BEING ELIMINATED BECAUSE THEY, AND THE TRIBES OF WHICH THEY ARE THE LEADERS AND FAVORITE SONS, POSE A THREAT TO THE CONTINUED CONTROL OF UGANDA BY <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>ʼS OWN TRIBE, <pb n="5" xml:id="d261-05" facs="d261-05"/>THE KAKWA, AND HIS WEST NILE ALLIES. IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> KNOWS MUCH ABOUT CHAKA, THE FOUNDER OF THE ZULU NATION, BUT THE TWO MEN HAVE MUCH IN COMMON. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: CHAKA WAS A CHIEF FROM A MINORITY CLAN IN SOUTH AFRICA WHO IN ABOUT 1818 BEGAN CONSOLIDATING THE ZULUS INTO ONE NATION BY WIDESPREAD BLOODSHED AND EXTERMINATION OF HIS ENEMIES. HE WAS MURDERED IN 1828.)</p>
                        <p>2. THE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE WEST NILE ARE THE NEW ELITE OF UGANDA, AND THEY INTEND TO REMAIN SO. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> WAS ONE OF THE FEW HIGH RANKING WEST NILERS IN THE ARMY AT THE TIME OF THE COUP ON 25 JANUARY 1970. THE COUP CHAIN OF COMMAND WENT ALMOST DIRECTLY FROM <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> TO THE WEST NILE SERGEANTS AND ENLISTED MEN. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> OUTFOXED THE NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR ACHOLI, LANGO AND ITESOT MILITARY PERSONNEL AND PRESENTED THEM WITH A PATT ACCOMPLI. IF FORMER PRESIDENT A. MILTON OBOTE HAD NOT BEEN SUCH A RANK TRIBALIST HIMSELF, THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TROUBLE. AT THE TIME, HOWEVER, THE CHANGE SEEMED FOR THE BETTER, AND THE ACHOLI, TESOT, AND OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS WENT ALONG WITH IT. THE LANGO HAD N0 CHOICE BUT TO FOLLOW SUIT.</p>
                        <p>3. WITH MORE PERCEPTION THAT HE SEEMED CAPABLE OF, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> SET ABOUT INSURING THE LOYALTY OF THE ARMY. HE REMOVED THOSE OFFICERS HE CONSIDERED DISLOYAL BY WHATEVER MEANS HE DEEMED NECESSARY AND I REPLACED THEM WITH MEN HE CONSIDERED LOYAL TO HIM. IN JULY 1970 THE ARMY HAD 99 ACHOLI <pb n="6" xml:id="d261-06" facs="d261-06"/>OFFICERS, SO LANGO, AND 107 WEST NILE; IN JANUARY 1972 THERE WERE 19 ACHOLI OFFICERS, 16 LANGO, AND 222 WEST NILERS. MOST OF THOSE REMAINING ACHOLI AND LANGO OFFICERS ARE IN SUPPORT POSITIONS. THE WEST NILERS, THE MAJORITY OF THEM FORMER WARRANT OFFICERS AND NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, CONTROL THE TROOPS. AMIN HAS SIMILARLY RIDDLED THE SENIOR POLICE RANKS ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOT REPLACED THOSE WITH WEST NILERS. RATHER, HE HAS LEFT THE POSITIONS VACANT.</p>
                        <p>4. THE MOVES AMIN MADE AGAINST MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. TODAY <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> COULD, IF HE WANTED, PROCLAIM HIMSELF EMPEROR CONSIDERING THE LACK OF OPPOSITION HE WOULD FACE. ALL IS NOT COMPLETELY SMOOTH, HOWEVER, WITHIN THE WEST NILE COALITION. THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS OF STRAIN BETWEEN THE LUGBARA, THE LARGEST WEST NILE GROUP, AND <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>ʼS KAKWA. IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT ANY SINGLE TRIBAL GROUP, SUCH AS THE LUGBARA, COULD BRING <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> DOWN ALONE, BUT, ACTING IN CONCERT WITH ONE OR MORE SIZEABLE TRIBAL GROUPS FROM ANY AREA, THE COALITION MIGHT SUCCEED. IT IS PROBABLY SUCH A POSSIBILITY AS THIS THAT <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> FEARS.</p>
                        <p>5. WITH THE MILITARY UNDER CONTROL, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> STILL HAS THE PROBLEM OF THE ELITE. BECAUSE OF THEIR POSITION IN UGANDA SOCIETY, THEY EITHER ARE THEMSELVES INFLUENTIAL OR ARE IN A POSITION OF STRONG INFLUENCE WITH THE ELDERS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRIBES. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> DOES NOT NEED TO ELIMINATE WHOLE TRIBES TO INSURE HIS CONTROL; HE NEEDS ONLY TO ELIMINATE THEIR <pb n="7" xml:id="d261-07" facs="d261-07"/>LEADERSHIP. IF THAT LEADERSHIP HAPPENS TO CORRESPOND WITH THE ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY, IT MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName>. IT IS INCREASINGLY EVIDENT THAT HIS EXTREMELY ELEMENTARY CONCEPT OF ECONOMICS AND GOVERNMENT SIMPLY DOES NOT PERMIT HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT DESTROYED TALENT CANNOT BE REPLACED OVERNIGHT OR EVEN IN A GENERATION. THE EXPELLED ASIANS REPRESENT MOST OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE TO BE FOUND IN UGANDA AND SOME KEY ASIAN TECHNICIANS ARE NOW BEING TURNED BACK AT THE AIRPORT, BUT MANY GOT AWAY EARLY. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE PRESENT PURGE WOULD NOT HAVE REACHED ANYWHERE NEAR ITS PRESENT LEVEL OF INTENSITY IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE ABORTIVE OBOTE-SPONSORED INVASION. IT APPEARS THAT THE INVASION MAY HAVE FRIGHTENED <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE HIM DECIDE TO GET HIS HOUSE INTO WHAT HE CONCEIVES TO BE THE PROPER ORDER, A SOCIETY IN WHICH HIS TRIBE AND ITS ALLIES ARE IN TOTAL CONTROL.</p>
                        <p>6. THE REALLY PUZZLING THING IS THAT <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">AMIN</persName> HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THE PRACTICE OF THIS PHILOSOPHY FOR SO LONG. IF HE HAS NOT ALREADY DONE SO, HE MAY BE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE HIS HOLD AND KEEP IT INDEFINITELY. THE ACHOLI, WITH ORIGINALLY THE GREATEST STRENGTH IN THE ARMY AND POLICE AND, ACCORDING TO THEIR CLAIMS, THE GREATEST MARTIAL TRADITION OF ANY TRIBE IN UGANDA, HAVE LET THEMSELVES BE SELECTIVELY SLAUGHTERED TO THE POINT THAT THEY WILL SOON HAVE NO LEADERSHIP LEFT. THE LANGO NEVER HAD A CHANCE; THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES SO THOROUGHLY HATED DURING THE OBOTE PERIOD THAT THE OTHER TRIBES WERE QUITE HAPPY TO <pb n="8" xml:id="d261-08" facs="d261-08"/>STAND BY AND SEE THEM CUT TO RIBBONS BY THE WEST NILERS, THE ITESOT ARE SOMEWHAT OF AN ENIGMA. THERE ARE STILL MANY OF THEM IN THE ARMY THEY HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN SO BEMUSED BY WATCHING THEIR ANCIENT ENEMIES THE LANGO AND THE ACHOLI, GET IT IN THE NECK, THAT IT HAS NOT OCCURRED TO THEM THAT THEY MIGHT BE NEXT. EXCEPT FOR THE BAGANDA, NONE OF THE OTHER TRIBES APPEAR TO HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH TO BE A PROBLEM FOR AMIN, ALTHOUGH THE WAY THE SAMIA ARE SUFFERING THEY MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG.</p>
                        <p>7. ONE COULD THINK OF THE BAGANDA AS THE BENGALIS OF UGANDA, TRADITIONALLY USING GUILE INSTEAD OF GUNS, BUT EVEN THE BENGALIS PRODUCED THE MUKTI BAHINI, EAST PAKISTANIʼS INDIGENOUS GUERRILLAS WHO FORMED AN EFFECTIVE FIGHTING FORCE AGAINST THE WEST PAKISTANIS. IT MAY BE THAT THE BAGANDA HAVE BECOME USED TO BEING TRAMPLED UPON AND ARE PUTTING HOPE FOR INDIVIDUAL SURVIVAL FIRST, AS ALL THEIR POTENTIAL ALLIES SEEM TO BE DOING.</p>
                        <p>8. WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN UGANDA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COLONIALISM, NATIONALISM, OR EAST-WEST IDEOLOGY. IT IS RAW TRIBALISM AT WORK, WITH THE CHIEF OF A MINOR TRIBE (THE CHAKA-ZULU SITUATION AGAIN) ON HIS WAY TO SUBJUGATING AND CONTROLLING THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES.

                            <item>United States Policies in Uganda</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As a result of discussions with Ambassador Melady during his consultations in Washington, the Department and other agencies have reached the following conclusions regarding our immediate and future policies toward Uganda.</p>
                        <p>In view of the vagaries of President <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs actions and the uncertainty of how the situation will develop in the months ahead, we have concluded that no long-term decisions should be made at this time. We have decided that in the absence of any serious changes in the political or internal security conditions in Uganda, our official activities will be maintained at roughly their current levels for the immediate future. We have a commitment to confer with the Congress before undertaking any new aid programs in Uganda. After Congress reconvenes in January, we can determine what our longer term role should be and whether such consultation is necessary. Our technical assistance and training programs, which are of direct benefit to the Ugandan people and which already are funded, will be maintained. No action will be taken on the $3-mi1lion livestock loan which has been under discussion. The Peace Corps office in Kampala will remain open until early next year to offset any possible adverse reaction from <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> resulting from the recent withdrawal of all of the 114 volunteers.</p>
                        <p>We are continuing to work closely with the United Nations and other internationa1 bodies in trying to ensure that all non-citizen Asians may leave Uganda <pb n="2" xml:id="d262-02" facs="d262-02"/>as rapidly and safely as possible and have somewhere to go. The stateless parolees coming to this country were flown out by the November 8 deadline. Nearly all of the 1,200 other stateless Asians who were not out by that date are now at or on their way to temporary transit centers outside Uganda, where they will await further word on permanent new homes. There had been signs that those overstaying the deadline, as well as the estimated 6,000-8,000 Asians who were exempted or who are Ugandan citizens, might be subjected to some harassment, but no serious incidents have been reported thus far. Nonetheless, the fate of those Asians staying on in Uganda remains highly uncertain.</p>
                        <p>The British position in Uganda also is continuing to deteriorate. The British Government now seriously doubts that it will be able to have satisfactory dealings with <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>, and its presence there, including technical assistance, is being wound down. Half of the 7,000 British residents have already left. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> Foreign and Commonwealth Office has told us that it does not regard Uganda as sufficiently important to its vital interests to attempt to arrest the deteriorating situation by active diplomatic or economic measures.</p>
                        <p>As part of their contingency planning, the British have asked whether we would assume the protection of their interests if a break in relations with the Ugandan Government should occur. We have expressed our willingness to do so.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to bring you up to date on the situation in Uganda and on our own policies toward that country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">1. <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>: What Next?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having ousted Israel, defeated the Tanzanian-backed invasion of Ugandan exiles, expelled Ugandaʼs 45,000 Asian residents, and terrorized his population into obedience, General <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">IDI AMIN</persName> appears to be riding high. The damage he has inflicted upon his economy seems of little consequence to him. Instead, the General seems bent upon further purifying his country of foreign influences so that he can build whatever tribal-Muslim society he dreams about. The British, Christian missionaries, and Ugandaʼs large Catholic population are all mentioned as being among <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs next targets for expulsion or repression. At this point, however, Uganda is relatively quiet as those who live there wonder what <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> will do next.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">2. The Situation for the British</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The British situation in Uganda has reached the point where the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has formally asked the US Government to protect their interests should <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> expel them. State has agreed to do so. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has told our Embassy in London that it does not regard Uganda as sufficiently important to its interests to arrest their deteriorating situation by active diplomatic or economic measures. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>ʼs presence in Uganda has been reduced from 7, 000 citizens in August to about 3,400.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">3. US Policies</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After consultations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Melady</persName>, who has unconvincingly argued for assistance to Uganda, State has recommended that we adopt a “wait-and-see” posture. In Stateʼs words: <pb n="2" xml:id="d263-02" facs="d263-02"/>“In view of the vagaries of President <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName>ʼs actions and the uncertainty of how the situation will develop in the months ahead, we have concluded that no long-term decisions should be made at this time. We have decided that in the absence of any serious changes in the political or internal security conditions in Uganda, our official activities will be maintained at their current levels for the immediate future.”</p>
                        <p>Stateʼs posture would permit technical assistance to continue. This involves an annual program of about $2 million, which covers the cost of 38 <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> personnel in the fields of agriculture, education and health. However, unless new funding is provided by July 1, our technical assistance programs will come to a halt.</p>
                        <p>Our Ambassador in Kampala, <persName corresp="#p_MTP1">Thomas Melady</persName>, would like to preclude such a termination. He says that “We cannot bring <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> in line by withdrawing our assistance.” Furthermore, he adds, “a drastic cutoff of aid might jeopardize the safety of our people.”</p>
                        <p>The African Bureau at State, on the other hand, tends to believe that at worst, a termination of US aid would simply lead to the expulsion of Americans. But, Stateʼs African Bureau feels, <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> might not even go that far because of Ugandaʼs need for American coffee purchases, and tourists.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">4. My Own Views</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the moment, I agree with State that no decisions need be taken concerning Uganda, particularly <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> levels. With our 114 Peace Corpsmen out, and technical assistance slimmed down from 50 personnel in August to 38 today, our assistance programs in Uganda could be allowed to die by attrition. Much will depend, of course, on what <persName corresp="#p_ADI1">Amin</persName> does next.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore my recommendation that the Department of State be informed that you agree that no decisions need be taken at this time concerning our official activities in Uganda but that you want to be informed beforehand should State-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> wish to give any new assistance to Uganda.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Stateʼs agreement to protect British interests, I find no objection. This will complicate our own problems in Uganda, but <pb n="3" xml:id="d263-03" facs="d263-03"/>if we chose to stay there, I assume that you would wish us to be of assistance to the British.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">RECOMMENDATIONS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. That I be authorized to inform the Department of State that you approve of their recommendation not to make long-term decisions concerning United States policy toward Uganda at this time, but that you wish to be advised beforehand if the Department feels new assistance funds should be allocated_ to Uganda.</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> has proposed that we continue our efforts toward the objective of reducing our presence at Kagnew in order to protect the most important functions there over the longer period (Tab A). The Services, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> are now conducting studies as you requested with this objective in mind. As you earlier advised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, these studies, in particular a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> communications study, probably will reveal that some reductions can be effected at Kagnew without degrading our [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] communications capabilities. We are not yet in a position to identify the extent of these reductions, but we will provide his staff the results of the studies as they are completed.</p>
                        <p>There are several new nuances in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>ʼs letter with which we are not in agreement. Rather than proscribing the assignment of new functions or new construction at Kagnew as proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, which seems unnecessarily binding, I believe we should continue our present policy of requiring agreement between your respective offices of any new undertakings at Kagnew.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> now proposes also that our planning look to an “eventual withdrawal” from Kagnew. As our earlier studies have suggested, however, we may wish to retain some of our functions at Kagnew as long as possible.</p>
                        <p>Contingency planning of course should continue against the possibility of being forced out of Kagnew. Our earlier technical studies, which you provided Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, laid out several alternative sites for the various activities now at Kagnew. The State Department has not yet commented on the political viability ofʼ these alternatives. We should press them on this point since, in our judgment, the alternative locations seem to offer no appreciably better prospects for tenure than we now have at Kagnew.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> also suggests an annual staff report to your respective successors on the withdrawal plan. I recommend that we leave this point <pb n="2" xml:id="d265-02" facs="d265-02"/>unanswered since your successors will be in a better position to judge how they want to handle the matter after they have received an assessment of the political viability of the alternatives.</p>

                        <p>THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<lb/>WASHINGTON 25, D.C.<lb/>14 JAN 1969</p>
                        <p>The Honorable <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Nicholas deB. Katzenbach</persName>
                            <lb/>Under Secretary of State<lb/>Washington, D. C. 20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Nick:</p>
                        <p>I have reviewed the proposals in your letter. of December 16th concerning our facilities at Kagnew and agree that any proposed new functions or new construction there should be referred to our respective successors for their review and approval, as you and I have done.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned in my letter of September 6th, we have undertaken specific studies of ways in which we might be able to reduce our personnel and acreage requirements at Kagnew without seriously de-grading our communications [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] capabilities.</p>
                        <p>-- [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] This plan should be complete in September 1969.</p>
                        <p>--The Joint Chiefs of Staff are studying ways, including the use of satellites, to consolidate Army (<gloss target="#t_STRATCOM1">STRATCOM</gloss>) and Navy communications functions at Kagnew, thereby reducing the amount of acreage required for communications purposes. This study should be completed in March 1969.</p>
                        <p>--The Secretary of the Army is surveying manpower needs to determine the minimum number of support personnel required at Kagnew. This report also will be submitted in March.</p>
                        <p>There are certain facilities at Kagnew which we should retain as long as possible unless there is some technological break-through which would permit our giving them up. As noted in the preliminary studies which we provided to you earlier, possible alternative locations not only are less satisfactory from a technical point of view -- particularly in the case of [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] activities -- but they also appear to offer no appreciably better political prospects for tenure. It would be a useful next step if the State Department would do a political analysis with respect to each of the alternative locations identified in the preliminary studies. Our contingency planning then can take into account the political or other price that we might be expected to pay in relocating all or some of the Kagnew facilities and the degree of certainty or risk involved in retaining the relocated facilities over a period of years.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d266-02" facs="d266-02"/>
                        <p>We will provide your staff with the results of our studies when completed. With this information and the political analysis which I have suggested, our Departments will be in a position to weigh the technical feasibility and political reliability of available alternative locations. They then can see whether the alternatives offer sufficient promise to warrant relocation of some or all of Kagnewʼs function.</p>
                        <p>The decisions which will be made as a result of these studies and the political analysis will be of great importance. Rather than our agreeing now on an annual progress report, I suggest that we leave our respective successors to develop the timing and form of reports which will best fit their needs.</p>

                        <p>1. Following provided in order you may have full range our present plans and thinking for your own background updating.</p>
                        <p>2. In context African and worldwide <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> resource limitations, Ethiopia program has fared well. It has not taken severe cuts suffered by other programs. In fact, program had been increased measurably over original projections in past few years to cover extraordinary additional items, such as F-5s, helicopters, and additional tanks. Twelve million dollars annually allocated for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 and proposed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 should not suggest any lessoning of interest in or withdrawal of support for Ethiopia. There has been no change in our policy or objectives.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> will provide $4.8 million for new investment items and $7.2 million for operating costs. In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 $3.5 million is allocated to investment items (including the completion of the Herter buyout and the first two C-119Ks) and $8.5 million is available for operating costs (including replacement items).</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d267-02" facs="d267-02"/>
                        <p>4. The following comments relate to paragraph 2 of ref b (re attrition vehicles, F-5s, CONUS training, ammunition): A. Vehicles. Army mobility will be materially enhanced in both years. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> will add 246 trucks and 229 trailers. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> presently proposes 110 new vehicles and 742 trailers. B. Attrition F-5 Aircraft. As you know, we had planned to cancel or as minimum defer the provision of an attrition F-5 in any case. If an attrition aircraft should in fact be required at a later date, we will consider the possibility of providing one, at appropriate <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> costs when the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F-5 training facility ceases operations. C. CONUS Training. In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 we will train 159 students (cost $633 thousand) and in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 plan to train 144 students (cost $629 thousand). These levels represent only small reductions from the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 program of $673 thousand. D. Training Ammunition. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 program contains $1.6 million for training ammunition and over $2.6 million is planned for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70. Amounts of training ammunition programmed in both years represent a major increase over the levels of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 ($811 thousand) and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 ($1.18 million). Current forecasts in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70-74 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> plans reflect an annual requirement for training ammunition averaging $2.6 million over the next five years. We believe detailed review should be made of actual requirements for hard core essential weapons training. In view high percentage total operating costs forecast for training ammunition, suggested review may reveal areas potential savings without adverse effect in essential training.</p>
                        <p>5. Foregoing levels of support and high level of planned deliveries including trucks, communications equip, and ammo during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 should be clear demonstration continued US interest and support. Obviously, somewhat higher <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> levels for these <pb n="3" xml:id="d267-03" facs="d267-03"/>years would be helpful, but they are not in the cards. Hopefully, Embassy will be able to make telling points with Ethiopians by pointing to high levels of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> we have been able to maintain for Ethiopia in light of drastic reductions in overall <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> appropriations from approximately $1 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66 to $375 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69.</p>
                        <p>6. Assume all members of mission aware that total dollar values of program year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69), budget year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70) and later years not releaseable to <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> and that in discussion of item content of budget year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70) program it must be made clear there is no USG commitment to deliver specific items from the program since adjustments may be required as result of Congressional action.<lb/>END</p>

                        <p>The reference airgram contained our assessment, as of six months ago, of the potential ELF threat to Kagnew Station. At that time we concluded that the ELF lacked both intent and capability to damage the U.S. presence in Eritrea, but that the beginnings of a more militant policy plus a larger degree of anti-American influence in the Front could be discerned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">INCREASED TEMPO OF ELF ACTIVITY</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In view of recent events, we think it timely to take a further look at the possibility for hostile action against Kagnew. After a midwinter lull, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has in March and April shown a high degree of activism and effectiveness against Ethiopian security forces. March saw the destruction of three oil tankers and two buses on the vital Asmara-Massawa highway, and the spectacular sabotage-bombing of an Ethiopian Air Lines commercial jet in Frankfurt, Germany; while in the first week of April, the ELF has staged a sophisticated attack on the main electiic power and water supply systems of the city of Asmara (ourtel 197).</p>
                        <p>Taken together, these recent incidents show a shift in <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> tactics and also a more sophisticated capability, previously lacking, to conduct skilled sabotage operations with modern explosive devices and weapons. They have also served to highlight the inability of <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> security forces to protect important economic installations fully against surprise attack.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">COMMUNIST SUPPORT</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Based on the scant intelligence available, we conclude that the latest round of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> attacks has been carried out by well-trained <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> “Commando” units schooled in Syria during the past year. In retrospect, small attacks against power pylons in Eritrea in the fall of 1968 were probably training <pb n="2" xml:id="d268-02" facs="d268-02"/>missions preparatory to the more recent major attacks. There may also be some degree of participation by smaller groups who have been trained recently in Communist China. German police believe that the Frankfurt airport attack of March 11 was carried out by two Syrians and one Ethiopian, using a highly sophisticated explosive device manufactured in Hungary, which had never been previously observed in the West (Frankfurtʼs 1765). The April 4 attack on power installations included use of explosives as well as firing of bazooka shells, and the weapons supply of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> - which has seemed to include more modern arms over the past six months - is believed to be largely from Communist sources.</p>
                        <p>This circumstantial evidence leads us to believe that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has significant improved its capability for sabotage and terrorism over the past six months, relying on Communist help, often channeled through Syria. Reflecting these changes, there have also been some alterations in the military organization of the movement, although the structure of the ELFʼs political arm, its “Revolutionary Council,” is not known to have changed.

                        <p>Throughout the past six month period, there has been no clear indication of a change in the traditional <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> policy of friendliness to Americans, although the US presence at Kagnew has been verbally attacked in occasional Radio Damascus broadcasts. However, in view of the recent rebel onslaught against major Ethiopian economic targets, Kagnew Station is continuing to maintain an alert security posture.</p>
                        <p>Under the US-Ethiopian Agreement on Defense Installations of May 22, 1953, the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> is wholly responsible for the external security of Kagnew, while the USG assumes responsibility for internal security. Kagnew is not a fortress, but a highly complex and far-flung communications facility, operated on separate parts of land mostly in and near Asmara, though several isolated substations are as much as thirty miles out of town. Its open antenna fields include substantial “shared-use” land used by local farmers. Thus, as has been noted in all previous USG studies of the security of the installations, there is no mean by which absolute security can he guaranteed in the face of a determined and effective group of saboteurs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">INCREASED US SECURITY ALERTNESS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A number of specific steps have been taken since last October to enhance the security alertness of Kagnew Station. We have had periodic meetings with the Governor General of Eritrea and local security officials to improve joint Ethiopian-US security plans. On all occasions, the Governor General has stressed Ethiopian Government responsibility for the external security of Kagnew, and has been most cooperative. It should be noted that none of the recent <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> attacks on Ethiopian economic installations have occurred within the Asmara city defense perimeter, where most Kagnew installations are located.</p>
                        <p>Kagnewʼs own security improvements during the past six months include: (1) an increase in night Security patrols; (2) improved night-lighting at some tracts; <pb n="3" xml:id="d268-03" facs="d268-03"/>(3) use of night-viewing scopes and anti-intrusion devices.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Recommendations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our analysis suggests that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> capability for sabotage against Kagnew has increased since the submission of Asmara A-174 of last October 9. However, we would emphasize that there is no indication that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> desires or intends to damage Kagnew. One of the conclusions of A-174 bears repeating at this time:</p>
                        <p>“… we should scrupulously avoid any change in our traditional stance towards the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, our view that the insurgency is strictly an internal matter for Ethiopians and Eritreans to decide. While maintaining our close relationship with the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss>, we should continue to avoid actions which directly link us to <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> security forces in prosecuting the war against the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. To become directly involved in military field operations against the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> would be, in effect, to invite <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> retaliation upon Kagnew and the US presence here. The USG ʼhands offʼ policy towards the insurgency over the years has complemented the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> ʼhands offʼ policy towards Kagnew.”</p>
                        <p>A recent [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] report [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] in which <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> officials are quoted as stating that in their contacts with American officials they have found the Americans more “flexible” than their contacts with the Soviets would seem to underline this point. We conclude that it behooves us to maintain our “correctʼ”3 attitude in any further approaches by <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> representatives to the USG, and to avoid any appearance of intervention in the Eritrean insurgency.</p>
                        <p>The latest <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> public statement directed to Americans is a newspaper interview granted by <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> Secretary General OSMAN SALEH SABBE to the Christian Science Monitor in Amman, Jordan, published in the March 28 edition Of that paper. Mr. Sabbe stated in the interview:</p>
                        <p>“We have said before, and we repeat, that we are not against Americans or their interests in Eritrea. The United States assists the Ethiopian Government in many fields, including military aid. But whenever we meet American officials, they justify this by saying it is simply part of their worldwide aid program. And they have diplomatic relations with Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>“We have never damaged American interests in Eritrea. We never intend to do so, as long as United States forces in Eritrea remain neutral.”</p>
                        <p>This statement can be interpreted both as a reassurance and a warning (see Asmara telegrams 202, 205). It is a reiteration of what <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> representatives have told us in private meetings over the years, but with the added hint that the rebels might “damage” US interests in Eritrea if the US alters its consistent policy of leaving the insurgency alone.</p>
                        <p>Beyond recommending that we rigorously adhere to a policy of non-interference in the insurgency, prudence compels us to make two further recommendations, <pb n="4" xml:id="d268-04" facs="d268-04"/>which we trust will receive the prompt attention and action of the Department and other Washington agencies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Recommendation #1</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We recommend that the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (<gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>) commence regular monitoring, translation and publication of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> broadcasts over Radio Damascus (“Voice of the Eritrean Revolution.”) These Damascus broadcasts are the main propaganda effort of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, and they are not currently covered on a systematic basis by <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>. Until these broadcasts are more regularly covered, with the results sent by rapid means to end-users including this Consulate General, we are somewhat in the dark as to changing elements in <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> propaganda and attitudes toward Kagnew Station. To be sure, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>ʼs public propaganda, geared as it is to radical Arab consumption, is no certain guide to <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> intentions toward our presence in Eritrea. But a careful analysis of the Damascus broadcasts may give us some hints of vital security importance to Kagnew Station.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Recommendation #2</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We recommend that the USG intelligence community determine that collection of accurate information on future meetings and congresses of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> political leadership receive a high priority. We believe that the decisions taken at such meetings are the key indicator of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> intentions towards Kagnew; and further that the present <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> non-interference policy towards Kagnew could only be altered after serious discussion among the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> leaders followed by a conscious decision to harass Kagnew. There are reports [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] of a major <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> congress to be held in June or July of this year, and we feel that US intelligence coverage of such events has an important bearing on the continued security of Kagnew Station.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Action Requested</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We would appreciate having the Departmentʼs prompt response to the above recommendations.</p>

                        <p>1. Request you extend Presidential invitation to Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> to make state visit to Washington during July 1969. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Emperor will be first African leader to receive such invitation. END <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Please propose and attempt confirm soonest dates July 7-9 for Washington leg of trip. Although willing consider other times, their approval unlikely as Presidentʼs schedule extremely tight. All other details are still in planning stage and subject to final Presidential approval. At this point you should confine your approach to confirmation of above dates.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Tentative planning is as follows: visit to Washington would Last two days plus. <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> to arrive afternoon or evening July 7 and depart morning July 10. Department seeking, but has not yet obtained, White House approval for late afternoon <pb n="2" xml:id="d269-02" facs="d269-02"/>arrival ceremonies at White House on July 7, including brief exchange of remarks after which <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> would retire to Blair House. First full day July 8 would include office call with President 11000 a.m. to 12030 p.m. and state dinner White House that evening. If arrival ceremony on July 7 not approved, then arrival would take place morning July 8 prior to office call. July 9 would have luncheon given by Secretary and presumably late afternoon reception by Ethiopians Tentative plans provide for brief farewell meeting of <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> with President. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>

                        <p>4. Given Emperorʼs age and Washington heat in July, will endeavor not overload schedule.</p>
                        <p>5. State visits usually provide travel for several days outside Washington and such can be provided for Emperor. However assume in light his previous visits this country and heat, he will probably wish return fairly soon to Ethiopia or Europe after leaving Washington. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> We have in mind possibility Emperor devoting one additional day to visit agricultural experimental station and also to Martin Luther Kingʼs tomb at Atlanta. Your comments appreciated. END <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Emperor and party not exceeding total of eight will be invited stay at Blair House. No more can be accommodated since section of Blair House under repair and thus any others will have to be put up at hotel at <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> expense. Hope party can be kept relatively small. In any case not more than twelve can be invited to White House dinner.</p>
                        <p>7. No press announcement until dates firmed up and time agreed upon for simultaneous US-Ethiopian release.</p>
                        <p>8. It is intended that theme for visit and principal subjects to be discussed will concentrate on exchange of views on current African developments with “Elder Statesman of Continent” and on Ethiopiaʼs <pb n="4" xml:id="d269-04" facs="d269-04"/>economic development. Appreciate that Emperor will also want to talk about his traditional fears of Arab-Soviet penetration of Red Sea Basin and he will probably put in plug for more military assistance. However we shall want to play down US military assistance, Kagnew, etc., particularly for media output, and by focusing on Ethiopiaʼs economic development, give encouragement to new Cabinet team and its efforts assign priority to economic and social progress.</p>

                        <p>A. We do not expect that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> can attain power in Eritrea except by coincidental consequence of a collapse of Governmental authority in Addis Ababa or the occurrence of major troubles at the borders in other provinces;</p>
                        <p>B. It appears the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> is receiving substantially increased Soviet and radical Arab arms support, money and training; this could ultimately be directed against the U.S. presence in Eritrea, though there is no sign yet that the Soviets and radical Arabs have control over <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> policy decisions; in any case for tactical reasons neither group at this stage would wish to reveal its anti-Kagnew objective for fear of direct U.S. aid to Ethiopia in its anti-<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> campaign;</p>
                        <p>C. The end of the current <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> economic sabotage campaign, aimed at world publicity, possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action and pressure on the Emperor, is not in sight; the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> can contain, but not defeat the guerrilla war in Eritrea. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> will try to score more small “coups” by attacking sensitive economic targets in Eritrea -- and more Ethiopian property abroad - in coming months; there is no single <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> policy or program that can prevent this or protect all possible <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> targets;</p>
                        <p>D. We have no indication that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> intends to attack Kagnew, though we may assume there is this possibility on the general principle that “the friend of my enemy is my enemy”; on the other hand there are reasons for assuming that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> does not intend hostile action against Americans. The past U.S. policy of non-interference in the Eritrean problem should be strictly maintained; we have nothing to gain and much to lose by injecting ourselves into the insurgency. We should consider reductions of Kagnew personnel and land tracts, and any other actions which would reduce the size of the potential target.</p>

                        <p>1. Fortunes of War: June 1967 to June 1969</p>
                        <p>During March, April and May of this year, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has launched a number of impressive attacks both within Eritrea and outside the borders of Ethiopia. This new, higher degree of activism and effectiveness is all the more noteworthy because it follows a period of some eighteen months which marked a relative lull in the seven-year Eritrean war.</p>
                        <p>Roughly coincident with the Arab-Israeli war of June 1967, the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> announced its first general amnesty for the rebels and commenced a program of stepped-up propaganda and mass appeals designed to foster the loyalty of the Eritrean people. It gave arms for self-defense to loyalist villagers, stepped up its own military and para-military offensive against the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, sought diplomatic agreements with the Sudan to end cross-border sanctuary for the insurgents, and described them in the public media as a foreign-directed subversive organization with pan-Arab aims.</p>
                        <p>By the fall of 1967 this new strategy, coupled with initial losses by the Arab states in wake of the debacle of the June War, seemed to be paying off handsomely for the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss>. There was a notable loss of ELF momentum, including some high-level defections to the Government and a shortage of rebel arms and ammunition, as Arab support temporarily dried up. This process seemed to continue through much of 1968, a year which saw the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> on the defensive within Eritrea. On September 6-7 they suffered the humiliating loss of about 100 killed in a pitched battle with police commandos at Hal-Hal in remote northwestern Eritrea.</p>
                        <p>Some <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> officials were quick -- too quick, as events have proved -- to see in the spectacular Hal-Hal victory “the beginning of the end” of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> as an organized armed force. Within six months after Hal-Hal, the insurgents commenced a series of effective guerrilla attacks on Government installations; and today, only nine months after their heaviest single reverse in the war, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> is on the offensive, and has demonstrated its ability to strike selected targets using sophisticated guerrilla tactics more impressive than any used before in the seven-year history of the conflict.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to the Horn.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">3. U.S. Policy Alternatives</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the face of these potential threats, which we can only very imperfectly gauge, what are the alternatives for U.S. policy? The following are the major different approaches that would be conceivable:</p>
                        <p>A. A “stand fast” policy at Kagnew. This would assume that the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> can weather the storms of insurgency and give adequate protection to the station, or that, even if violence continues in Eritrea at its present level, the U.S. would be generally unaffected and/or unable to influence the course of events politically or militarily. At the same time, consideration would be given to some reductions of personnel and antenna-field, space at Kagnew, looking ahead to the lease termination date of 1978 and based on the increasing technological obsolescence of certain types of communications ground tasks as satellite communications technology advances. The goal here would be to reduce the size of the target Kagnew presents, not only to possible hostile attack but also to political criticism by elements within the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> who may come to power after Haile Selassie, and to demonstrate to the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> that our stake in Kagnew is a limited one.</p>
                        <p>B. U.S. intervention in the war on the side of Ethiopia through open counter-insurgency training aimed at the rebels and other possible assistance. This would be a dangerous and possibly open-ended commitment which would invite rebel retaliation upon Kagnew and involve U.S. casualties in the field, with the prospect of widening rather than lessening the war and stimulating even greater increments of radical Arab and Soviet aid to the rebellion. We can continue a Military Assistance Program to Ethiopia as a whole, the benefits of which improve the Ethiopian ability to cope with the insurgency without running serious risks.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d270-05" facs="d270-05"/>
                        <p>C. U.S. diplomatic pressure on the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> for a “political solution” of the troubles based on restoring a degree of internal autonomy to Eritrea. This advice would be most unwelcome to the Emperor, who seems determined to pursue a hard line with the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> for reasons of prestige and vital Ethiopian interests. The <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> would see a return to the pre-1962 Federation as leaving a political vacuum along its Red Sea coast which Arab neighbors would try to fill (Nasserʼs commencement of the Yemen adventure in 1962 was one of the factors triggering <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>ʼs annexation of Eritrea). Now that full independence is the goal of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> leadership, they would be unlikely to settle for anything less and the fighting would continue, though with a small net gain in popular support, for the <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> for promising more autonomy.</p>
                        <p>With neither a military nor a political solution in sight, alternative A, above, is our present policy, with the addition that we now suggest commencing serious study of some reductions at Kagnew. Alternative B would be a dangerous and impractical course, and alternative C would. not seem to accomplish a U.S. purpose, while dragging us deeply into Ethiopiaʼs internal problems.</p>
                        <p>The sometimes expressed view that we can retain the U.S. presence in Eritrea under an <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> regime is not tenable. It is possible to conceive of an <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> takeover only in conditions which would render our continued, day-to-day operations difficult at best, impossible at worst. An <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> regime, relying on Arab states for its retention of power and being to a marked degree their puppet with substantial direct and indirect support from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China would not tolerate Kagnew Station.</p>
                        <p>We conclude that the best U.S. policy is one of (a) continued political and military non-interference in the Eritrean problem; (b) reductions in our profile at Kagnew as technology permits; and (c) continuation of our present or somewhat increased level of military assistance to the Ethiopian armed forces.</p>
                        <p>A final caveat should be added that developments in the Sudan over the next year may require a reevaluation of these fore-casts and policy proposals.</p>

- ACTION MEMORANDUM</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Emperorʼs Tentative Schedule: The Emperor of Ethiopia at the invitation of the President will arrive in Washington the after-noon of July 7, 1969 to begin a State visit. He will have talks with the President and other senor officials July 8 and 9.</p>
                        <p>He will attend a prayer breakfast with members of Congress before formally leaving Washington about 9:30 a.m., July 10, for the U.S. Agricultural Research Station at Beltsville, Maryland. After touring the Station, he will return to Andrews Air Force Base to board the Presidentʼs plane for Atlanta and Cape <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>. He will have lunch on the plane. Arriving at Dobbins Air Force Base, Atlanta, about 1:30 p.m., July 10, the Emperor is scheduled to lay a wreath on Mr. Kingʼs grave and then attend a brief ceremony at Sisterʼs Chapel to accept an honorary degree from Morehouse College. He would depart Atlanta about 4:00 p.m. for Cape <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>He will visit the facilities at the Cape the morning of July 11 and then depart for New York City. His visit in New York is private. He is expected to leave the country the evening of July 12.</p>
                        <p>Why Visit Kingʼs Grave: The Emperor has devoted much of his life to working in the cause of the peaceful settlement of disputes. Founding father of the United Nations and Organization of African Unity, he has repeatedly been called on to mediate conflicts whether between Algeria and Morocco or in Nigeria. His proudest sobriquet is peacemaker.</p>
                        <p>In the initial discussion with Ethiopian Ambassador Minassie concerning the Emperorʼs schedule, Minassie was enthusiastic about the Emperorʼs visit to Kingʼs grave. He had to be dissuaded from announcing it to the press immediately. When the idea was posed to the Ethiopians in Addis Ababa, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HWTTA1">Aklilu</persName> said the “Emperor liked the idea” and “Reverend Kingʼs general objectives of<lb/>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d271-02" facs="d271-02"/>non-violence and peace are admired in Ethiopia” (Addis Ababa 2678, para 10). Aklilu only wished to be certain that the Emperorʼs visit to Kingʼs grave would not be taken as interference in the U.S. domestic political scene.</p>
                        <p>Our relation with Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> is close and of long standing. Many young, educated Ethiopians--the leaders of Ethiopia when the Emperor dies--have come to believe that we are not aware of their hopes and aspirations. Nobel Prize winner Martin King is one of their heroes. A visit by the Emperor to Kingʼs grave during his State visit here would help importantly to improve the image of the U.S. in eyes of the young elite in Ethiopia. It would also be well received by moderates in our own society who are devoted to Kingʼs principle of non-violence.</p>
                        <p>Status of Atlanta Stop by Emperor: The proposal for the Emperor to stop in Atlanta to lay a wreath on Kingʼs grave and other possible activities in the Atlanta area was discussed at a White House meeting June 5 with members of the Presidentʼs National Security Council staff. The proposed schedule of the Emperor, with appropriate clearances, was then transmitted to the Addis Ababa Embassy (State 092841). The Ethiopiansʼ favorable reply to the Atlanta stop was noted above (AA 2678). White House approval was also obtained before a telephone call was made to Morehouse College President Gloster to alert him of the possibility of the Emperorʼs visit and to ask his cooperation. President Gloster was most excited at the prospect and offered to poll his Board in order to be prepared to present to the Emperor an honorary degree. Citizens of Atlanta are justly proud of the racial harmony in their city. The Emperorʼs stop at Atlanta was consistently described as most tentative, but undoubtedly a good many in Atlanta are now aware it is under consideration and may be keenly disappointed if the Emperor fails to appear.</p>
                        <p>If the visit by the Emperor to Atlanta is now cancelled, we can offer an explanation if asked which will appear reasonable, although it may give rise to some doubts in the black community. The Emperor is nearing 77 years of age. He will have had a busy schedule in Washington. It will likely be hot. On his day of departure from Washington, July 10, he is already scheduled for an early morning breakfast with Congressmen, a formal departure ceremony, and a visit to an agricultural station. Permitting the Emperor part of an afternoon and an evening to rest is certainly justifiable, al-though the Emperor does not usually permit the prospect of fatigue to interfere with activities he considers important.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I strongly urge that the Emperorʼs proposed <pb n="3" xml:id="d271-03" facs="d271-03"/>stop at Atlanta be retained in the schedule. He will be in Atlanta less than three hours. His visit to Kingʼs grave will be appreciated by his own young elite in Ethiopia and improve the U.S. image with this important group of future Ethiopian leaders. It will also be a notable event to moderates, here and in Africa, who have embraced the principles of non-violence. Any indication that the U.S. Government had discouraged the visit could be misinterpreted and possibly embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you approve the Emperorʼs stop in Atlanta to lay a wreath at Mr. Kingʼs grave and to accept an honorary degree from Morehouse College.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs Stop in Atlanta</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The following is a complete run-down (most of it I have only second-hand) on the origin of the stop, my involvement in the scheduling, the authority for the final decision, and the current status.</p>
                        <p>1. The idea apparently originated some months before the visit in routine conversations between the Emperorʼs advisors and our Embassy officials in Addis Ababa. The Ethiopians said the Emperor much admired King and would like to honor his memory on any future visit to the United States. When serious planning began for the visit in May-June, the Embassy forwarded this information to State as one of its suggestions for a suitable stop in the schedule.</p>
                        <p>2. State saw nothing unusual in Ethiopians raising the idea. King is an established hero throughout Africa, and his non-violence is particularly apt for leaders like Haile Selassie who are trying to be progressive without opening the door to left-wing radicals.</p>
                        <p>3. Once the Presidentʼs invitation to <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> was announced, discussions began with the Ethiopians on a schedule. The matter of Atlanta came up again, but our Embassy only took note and made no commitments. Shortly after the public announcement, I understand Morehouse College in Atlanta let it be known to State that it would like to give the Emperor an honorary degree. The degree idea is also routine for African visitors: President Tubman of Liberia, for example, got such a degree at Morehouse last fall. But State told Morehouse at the time only that we were considering their request and we would let them know.</p>
                        <p>4. About two weeks ago I got a phone call from Sam Westerfield, Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. WESTERFIELD said that <pb n="2" xml:id="d272-02" facs="d272-02"/>the African Bureau and Embassy Addis Ababa felt strongly that we should let the Emperor lay a wreath at Kingʼs grave, and also meet the request of Morehouse to give him an honorary degree at the same time. WESTERFIELD said there was a hitch, however, because Ambassador Mosbacher, who is responsible for visit planning, had misgivings about the stop. Specifically, Mosbacher thought there might be a reaction against the Emperor in the black community of Atlanta. WESTERFIELD said that Mosbacher was worried that the Emperorʼs autocratic rule and preservation of feudalism in Ethiopia would invite picketing by black militants. WESTERFIELD asked if I could give him a political reading on this question. I replied that I was not competent to judge what the black community in Atlanta thought of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>, but we should certainly avoid any embarrassing incidents. I told WESTERFIELD that I understood State had their own channels on such questions to the political side of the White House. But, for whatever use it might be, I would get in touch with Robert Brown, who I understood to be the Presidentʼs Special Assistant for minority problems, and ask Brown to double check that there would be the necessary reading on Mosbacherʼs question from the domestic side of the White House.</p>
                        <p>5. I then called Brown, explaining WESTERFIELDʼs request. I told Brown that Ambassador Mosbacher was in charge of the planning for the visit, and he (Brown) or someone appropriate should get in touch with Mosbacher and WESTERFIELD directly to provide the necessary reading if it hadnʼt been given routinely. Brown said off-hand that he saw no problem for the Emperor with the Atlanta black community, that he thought the visit was a good idea “in every respect,” and would get in touch with Mosbacher after he had checked the problem out.</p>
                        <p>I talked no more with Brown, WESTERFIELD, or anybody else on the matter.</p>
                        <p>6. I understand that the African Bureau raised the question of the stop with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> last week, just prior to the Secretaryʼs trip with the President to Canada. Last Saturday, the African Bureau was told by the 7th floor the visit was OK. On Monday of this week, the African Bureau was told by Sam King (Mosbacherʼs Deputy in Protocol) that Mosbacher had approved the stop in Atlanta on explicit authority from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. (I was not privy at the time to any of these developments over last weekend, and I only learned about them today in checking.)</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d272-03" facs="d272-03"/>
                        <p>7. Thus, on the authority of the Secretary, State moved ahead to schedule the step with the Ethiopians and arranged for the honorary degree from Morehouse. The schedule has been handed out routinely to the press, and arrangement have been made in Atlanta for a two-hour stop by the Emperor. He will lay a wreath at Kingʼs grave in a ten-minute ceremony and then go to Morehouse College for a thirty-minute ceremony to receive the honorary degree. He then departs promptly for Cape <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Turning it Off</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From a foreign policy point of view, my judgement is that it would be embarrassing but not impossible to get out of the stop with the Ethiopians. The Emperor has always been a good and discreet friend of the United States, and there would be minimum risk of any leaks from him or his government. The omission of the stop would probably go largely unnoticed in the rest of Africa. (I should add, however, that inclusion of the stop would be noticed in Africa, and would clearly be a plus for the U.S. image. African opinion would see the laying of the wreath as an acknowledgement by the U.S. of Kingʼs international stature, and thus a positive sign of our commitment on the racial question. Beyond these judgements, though, I cannot advise you as to what the impact will be domestically of a cancellation at this point. A lot of people know in Atlanta, and the Washington or New York press could easily pick it up and play it at will.</p>
                        <p>In sum: I was aware, as described above, of some doubts about the reception which the Emperor might be given by the black community in Atlanta. But at no point did I give anyone, formally or informally, a go-ahead, judgement, etc. on the domestic political issue of the Emperorʼs stop. As I told WESTERFIELD when he raised the matter, this was strictly out of my competence or authority, and that is why I referred the question forthwith to Robert Brown. It was my understanding that, as a matter of routine, Stateʼs Protocol does a political check with the domestic side of the White House on such questions, and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff is simply not involved on these aspects of the trip. Finally, as recounted above, I understand the Atlanta stop was considered specifically and approved directly by the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d272-04" facs="d272-04"/>
                        <p>Strictly on foreign policy grounds -- to get good public mileage out of the visit for the U.S. in Africa; to accommodate the Ethiopians wherever possible when we have to refuse their request for massive military aid; and even to help give the Emperor a more progressive and thus more durable image in Ethiopia where he is the best insurance for our important interests there such as the Kagnew intercept station -- I would have thought the visit made sense. But this would only be the case, obviously, if the responsible people could make a careful calculation that there would be no risk on the domestic side of racial incidents involving the Emperor, and thus embarrassing everybody.</p>
                        <p>As a footnote to the sequence described above, Al Haig asked me this morning to check on possible problems with the stop. I understood from Al that this had to do with potential racial trouble in Atlanta that could involve the Emperor and thus embarrass us. I told Al what I knew (the background above) about this, and said I would check again with Brown.</p>
                        <p>I called Brown, but he was on his way to a meeting in Mississippi. I then called John Price on Moynihanʼs staff, to whom Brownʼs office referred me. Price said he would look into the problem and call back. Meanwhile, Bruce Rabb, from Browns staff, called to ask if he could help in his bossʼ absence. I explained my request of Price. Rabb said heʼd coordinate with Price and call me back. So far (8:15) I havenʼt heard from either.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Ethiopia is our closest friend in Africa. Our purposes in this visit are (a) to show the new Administration will continue that relationship and (b) to honor the Emperor as a moderate, pro-Western leader with a potential peacemaking role in African quarrels.</p>
                        <p>The main problem in doing this is to reassure <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> of our support without being drawn into his own parochial and exaggerated view of threats to Ethiopian security. The Emperor has an appetite for U.S. arms which we can neither satisfy under present military aid limitations nor justify in terms of our own estimate of his position. Moreover, military concerns divert the Emperor from economic development -- where we can help and where prompt action is crucial to Ethiopiaʼs stability and thus to our interests in the country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Emperor</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At 76, on the throne for over half a century, <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> sees himself as one of the towering figures of modern history. He assumes not only his acknowledged role as Africaʼs elder statesman, but also a stature and wisdom in world affairs beyond the Continent.</p>
                        <p>His outlook was clearly shaped by the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in the thirties -- his dramatic but futile appeal to the League of Nations, a bitter wartime exile, a restoration only to find court intrigue and Communist efforts at subversion. Added to these experiences was the traditional fear of Christian Ethiopia being overwhelmed by surrounding Moslems. The product in the Emperor is a virtual siege mentality, in which Soviet arms aid to neighboring Somalia, Sudan and Yemen seems larger than life. The West, he fears, will repeat the mistakes of the thirties if it underestimates the threat to Ethiopia. Thus, the Emperor <pb n="2" xml:id="d273-02" facs="d273-02"/>sees a common interest with the U.S. in making Ethiopia a bulwark against a Communist-Moslem thrust into the Horn of Africa.</p>
                        <p>To these views (and most others) the Emperor brings both a passion from tragic experience and a sensitivity born of a royal self-esteem. Yet, as you know from your earlier meeting with him, these deeper qualities that determine his thinking may be deceptively obscured beneath a quiet, almost somber exterior in his personality.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Ethiopiaʼs Domestic Situation and Foreign Policies</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At home the Emperor is caught, like most modernizing monarchs, in a dilemma of his own making. He has built a modern state from feudal fragments, surrendered some prerogatives to a constitution, and educated an urban elite -- all in the interests of a stronger nationhood against the external danger. Now he is finding, inevitably, that these steps have only created greater political momentum -- particularly among the young --toward a surrender of autocratic powers which he is determined to preserve.</p>
                        <p>Thus the student riots this spring at the Imperial University in Addis Ababa, and a growing concern (which we should share) that the Emperorʼs death will usher in a period of political chaos. Basic reform of the government is probably not possible while the Emperor is alive. But a serious effort to spur economic development could provide an escape valve for the volitile energies and frustrations in Ethiopia. The Emperor took a halting step in that direction last February by bringing younger progressives into key economic jobs in his Cabinet. These men could make the difference between orderly change and a blow-up in Ethiopia. As with the Shah of Iran and his reformers over the last decade, we have a stake in their success. It remains an open question whether the problem is soluble. Modernization may make royal rule impossible but failure to modernize may produce an explosion.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this dissidence at the center, the Emperorʼs most immediate problem is the continuing insurgency of the Eritrean Liberation Front -- an irredentist Moslem movement claiming the extreme northeastern corner of Ethiopia. The Front is armed by radical Arab states and is increasingly sophisticated at sabotage. Harsh reprisals by Ethiopian troops have also helped to strengthen the appeal of the insurgents among the local population of Eritrea. The army seems well able for the moment to prevent any major gain of territory by the insurgents, but the rebellion is a worry and a drain on valuable resources. The outcome will depend to some extent on the degree of assistance coming to Eritrea from across the Red Sea - Yemen and Aden especially.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d273-03" facs="d273-03"/>
                        <p>The Ethiopians fear greater support for the Front from the new leftist regime in the Sudan, just as they suspect continuing Somali irredentism on the southern border despite the recent detente between Haile Selassie and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> of Somalia. Ethiopian foreign policy, in fact, has banked heavily on the detente with Somalia to free their flank while facing the extension of Soviet influence, via the Arab states, into the Red Sea Basin. The border truce with Somalia will probably hold because Egal is a strong, inward-looking leader. But the new radical government in the Sudan and the Soviet courtship of Southern Yemen compound the Emperorʼs fears.</p>
                        <p>Our best intelligence judges, however, that (1) the Sudanese leftists have their hands too full at home (including their own insurgency in the Southern Sudan) to pose a major threat to Ethiopia, and (2) the Soviets are still on shifting sands in Southern Yemen, where a Yemeni detente with Saudi Arabia, already developing, could all but cut the Russians out.</p>
                        <p>Aside from regional concerns, the Emperor continues to be a strong supporter of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping and African Unity. He was a founder of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. Both the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Economic Commission for Africa have head-quarters in Addis. You will recall the Emperor has made several -- albeit unsuccessful -- efforts to mediate the Nigerian civil war on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">US-Ethiopian Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the early fifties, the Emperor has managed a skillful balancing act between de jure “non-alignment” respected throughout the Third World and a de facto special relationship with the U.S. We have been the heaviest contributor to their economic development, a primary market for their important coffee exports, and the ultimate quartermaster for the Ethiopian army and air force.</p>
                        <p>Our economic aid now runs about $20 million per year. Military assistance is $12 million yearly. In return, we enjoy a major communications [text not declassified] station at Kagnew, just outside Asmara in Eritrea. We operate under a bilateral agreement that runs to 1978. Kagnewʼs location provides advantages that would be either difficult or impossible to duplicate. Yet it could be a vulnerable target for the insurgent Eritreans, and gives the Ethiopians the usual host-country leverage in extracting military aid for base rights.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">In summary:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>-- The Emperor comes here as an ally to (i) cement old ties, (ii) alert us to what he sees as a common and immediate peril in the Horn of Africa, and (iii) get more military aid.<lb/>-- We invited him as an old friend to: (i) reassure him of our support, (ii) prompt him to move forward on critical economic progress, but (iii) hold the “price” of good relations -- and thus interests such as Kagnew Station --at the present level of military aid, which is sufficient to the Emperorʼs real needs.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Opening</p>
                        <p>-- You last saw the Emperor in Addis in 1967.<lb/>-- Invite him to give his reflections on the broader state of world politics. (This bow to the Emperorʼs wisdom should set a good tone but will lead, in any event, to his local concerns.)</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Emperor will recite Soviet and Arab designs on Ethiopia and the Red Sea basin. He may exaggerate Soviet arms deliveries, and conclude Ethiopia urgently needs more U.S. military help.</p>
                        <p>Your Points in Reply</p>
                        <p>-- We are watching the area carefully and are most sympathetic to Ethiopiaʼs security concerns.<lb/>-- We want to assure the Emperor of our strong continuing support in his defense needs. Our traditional relationships in security matters are clearly in our common interests.<lb/>-- But the picture is not altogether bleak:</p>
                        <p>(1) The radicals in the Sudan have absorbing internal problems.</p>
                        <p>(2) So too are the Yemenis pre-occupied internally, and the Soviet inroad there is not secure.</p>
                        <p>(3) Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs re-election is a strong factor for continuing detente - which the Emperorʼs statesmanship helped build with Somalia.</p>
                        <p>(4) In any case, we think Ethiopiaʼs forces can meet any threat from neighboring armies that are poorly trained by comparison.</p>
                        <p>-- The Congress is very concerned about U.S. military help sparking arms races or diverting resources from development.<lb/>-- We have managed to maintain our military aid to Ethiopia in the face of Congressional cuts only because we are concerned about the Emperorʼs problems. (Ethiopia gets over 60% of U.S. military aid to Africa.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Emperor may catalog economic progress: the Cabinet reshuffle to give development new priority and financial reforms. But he will stress the need for more aid.</p>
                        <p>Your Points in Reply</p>
                        <p>-- We think steady economic progress is critical to Ethiopiaʼs stability and thus to her strength against external dangers.<lb/>-- We applaud the Emperorʼs recent steps and his personal concern in development. We want to help every way we can -- including a new $5 million agricultural sector loan now under discussion.<lb/>-- Our resources are necessarily limited, however. Ethiopia should also look to the World Bank, <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and U.S. private investment. We will help them where we can in these efforts.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Nigeria</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>-- You are deeply concerned about the starvation in Nigeria/Biafra. We know how hard the Emperor has worked for peace in this tragedy. But the need is greater than ever for new initiatives in light of the new Federal Nigerian policy on relief.</p>
                        <p>The Federals insist that only daylight relief flights may go into Biafra.</p>
                        <p>Yet Biafra insists there must be some third party guarantee of such a daylight air corridor against surprise bombing of Biafran airfields.</p>
                        <p>-- Does the Emperor see any <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> role in solving this problem of third party guarantees in relief? Could the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> act jointly, for example, with the United Nations?<lb/>-- Or might Ethiopia, as it has in other peacekeeping activities, combine to act with other Africans, including friends of both Nigeria and Biafra?<lb/>-- Beyond an urgent resumption of relief, the only answer to the suffering is a peaceful settlement in Nigeria.<lb/>-- Does the Emperor see any role for the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, for Ethiopia, or for the U. S. in helping bring this about?<lb/>-- We are most anxious to explore these possibilities with the Emperor while he is here.</p>

                        <p>You are scheduled to call on Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> for a protocol visit (about one hour) at Blair House on 9 July, 0900 hours. I plan to accompany you. The Emperor will have had discussions with the President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> on Tuesday and is scheduled for another talk with the President following your meeting. The Ethiopian Ambassador to Washington, Dr. Minasse Haile, will serve as interpreter. (The Emperor understands English if spoken slowly.)</p>
                        <p>The Emperor at the age of 77 is a dignified individual who continues to aspire to a position of leadership in Africa and as a world statesman. In this vein, he will probably have exchanged views with the President in a global perspective, including Vietnam. The Emperor is principally concerned, however, as he was during his visit in February 1967, over what he views as dangerous threats to Ethiopiaʼs security and the need for increased support from the United States. The Emperor will express his concern over Soviet and UAR encroachment in the Red Sea Basin, external aid being given the Eritrean Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>), Somalia irredentist claims and insurgency in the Ogaden, and fears over the recent coup in Sudan (and the new regimeʼs likely radical orientation). He has been alarmed by the impressive Soviet military programs in neighboring Somalia (over $35 million) and Sudan (about $60 million to be delivered under a 1968 agreement).</p>
                        <p>The Emperor is uncertain about how the new Administration views its relationships with Ethiopia. His main objective will be to gain renewed assurances of U.S. interest in and support for Ethiopiaʼs security.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor is not particularly well informed on military matters and tends to think in political and psychological terms. He views comparative numbers of items delivered to his country and to his enemies as having overriding significance and that the larger Ethiopian Army should have a proportionally larger number of tanks and other weapons. (See Tabs C-2 and C-3 for a comparison of Ethiopian and Somalian and Sudanese Forces; in some cases the markedly smaller Somalia Army has larger quantities of equipment, e.g., tanks.) <pb n="2" xml:id="d274-02" facs="d274-02"/>The Ethiopians have not presented us with a detailed “shopping list”, and we doubt that the Emperor will surface specific military items or quantities with you. He submitted a “shopping list” of well over $150 million during his 1967 visit and went away disappointed with a $2.5 million increase in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. He may express his needs in general terms such as for more armor and aircraft and a strong “deterrent” force (a term with great appeal to him). Also, Ethiopiaʼs need for additional helicopters has been a recurring theme. He has asked that his Minister of Defense, Kebbede Guebre, have follow-on meetings in Defense, presumably to discuss definitive requests (See Tab D - Items <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> Kebbede May Raise). <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> may refer to these follow-on meetings during your visit and present you with a document intended for later discussions with Kebbede. If he does, I suggest you accept it without specific comment, saying that you will have your staff study it immediately, and that I will make arrangements for a follow-on meeting with Kebbede. (If Kebbede intends to accompany the Emperor to Cape <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>, I can suggest a Saturday morning meeting - the party will pass through Washington on its way back to Ethiopia Friday afternoon).</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that the Emperor will use the leverage provided by our important Kagnew communications facility at this time because of our own leverage represented by our overall economic and military assistance to Ethiopia. His military forces are almost completely equipped with U.S. equipment and dependent upon us for follow-on support.</p>
                        <p>Our objective during this visit is to do what we can to demonstrate to the Emperor that we are truly interested in Ethiopiaʼs security without increasing our current and planned level of military assistance ($l2-$13 million). I believe that you could best contribute to this objective by expressing to <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> the Talking Points at Tab A.</p>
                        <p>It is not necessary for you to read all of the briefing material --most of it has been prepared as background for my more detailed follow-on meeting with Kebbede. You should read, however, the summary of the Memo of Conversation between Mr. McNamara and the Emperor at Tab B, which is essentially the approach I am recommending for you to take. If you have time, it would also be useful if you would look over the Background Paper on Military Assistance at Tab C, and the Talking Point Paper at Tab D that I will use in my meeting with Kebbede.</p>

                        <p rend="center">VISIT OF EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE I OF ETHIOPIA<lb/>JULY 7-9, 1969<lb/>MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND KAGNEW STATION<lb/>RESUME AND PROBLEMS</p>
                        <p>DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>1. Military assistance for Ethiopia is essentially quid pro quo for the unhampered use of our vital communication [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] facility, Kagnew Station, at Asmara (see Tab A-1 -- Background Paper on Kagnew). Our objective is to retain this facility (no feasible alternative is available) at minimum cost to the U.S. by providing limited but effective support to the Ethiopian military forces. Although Ethiopia recognizes the leverage provided by Kagnew, a direct relationship has not been raised in connection with the visit.</p>
                        <p>2. Since 1960, Ethiopia has exerted constant pressure for increased military assistance. They have not been satisfied with the amount, the speed of delivery and the modernity of the equipment. This dissatisfaction has been aggravated by concern over external and internal threats and has been prevalent despite a general lack of capability to assimilate materiel at a faster pace, a lack of legitimate need, and a shortage of funds to operate and maintain the equipment.</p>
                        <p>3. The U.S. under the 1960 Herter Commitment agreed to support (organize, train and equip) up to a 40,000-man Ground Force, contingent upon the Ethiopian capability to absorb the materiel. In addition, there have been several smaller commitments related to the Air Force and Navy, which have already been completely funded. The U.S. has programmed about $141.6 million of military assistance for Ethiopia through Fiscal Year 1969, or approximately 53.5 per cent of the total African program. Another $12.0 million is planned for 1970, about 58.5 per cent of the African total. The initial equipment required under the Herter Commitment is planned to be funded by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70, with deliveries completed by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. The Ethiopians undoubtedly expect us to continue to support their forces indefinitely. And, as long as we have the need for Kagnew, we will at least be required to continue <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> at about the projected levels, i.e. $12-13 million annually.</p>
                        <p>ETHIOPIAN POSITION</p>
                        <p>1. The Emperor will probably emphasize external threats from the UAR, Sudan, Somalia and Soviet encroachment in the Red Sea Basin. He may refer to several long-standing internal dissidence problems. The Eritrean Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>) in the past few months has demonstrated <pb n="4" xml:id="d274-04" facs="d274-04"/>Kagnew Station is an important U.S. communications and [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] facility - an Army Security Agency Installation, a <gloss target="#t_STRATCOM1">STRATCOM</gloss> facility and a Navy Communications Station. Approximately 1800 U.S. personnel plus some 1400 dependents are stationed there and we lease some 3400 acres from the Ethiopian Government. The facilities operate under a US-<gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> agreement which runs until 1978 and can then be terminated by either party on one-year notice.</p>
                        <p>Because of its geographic location and unique radio freaqency environment Kagnew is ideally suited to certain [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] operations. The Army Security Agency installation (which includes the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] facility) and its 1250 personnel satisfy security requirements of the highest priority. Relocation of the facility would be expensive and could not be accomplished without degrading significantly [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] capabilities.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_STRATCOM1">STRATCOM</gloss> facility supports the Army Security Agency installation and in addition is an important link in our global communications network. The Navy Communications Station provides tactical ship-to-shore terminals for fleet units operating in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Costs</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>- To duplicate facility - $115 million (if a politically and technically suitable alternative could be found)<lb/>- Annually for operation and maintenance - $4.4 million<lb/>- Annually for military salaries - $10.0 million (approximately)</p>

                        <p>The Emperor opened the conversation by expressing his appreciation for past economic and military assistance. Continuing assistance, especially in the economic area, is required, however, if Ethiopia is to remain strong. The Emperor then enumerated briefly the threats to Ethiopiaʼs integrity from surrounding countries.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized his own abiding interest in Ethiopia which derived from his personal knowledge of the situation as the result of his two visits. He explained that the question of military assistance is a particularly sensitive one in the Congress at the present time. Congressional appropriations for military assistance are limited and Ethiopia is already receiving approximately 60 percent of the entire amount of funds available for Africa, Nevertheless, he wanted the Emperor to know that he recognized Ethiopiaʼs problems, that we are conscious indeed of what Ethiopia has stood for and that we have a special interest in assisting it to continue to develop as a strong and independent nation. Economic assistance, while also difficult, may be somewhat more manageable and we will certainly do our best to continue to be of help. Emphasizing the importance we also attach to the Emperorʼs role as an African and world leader, the President stated that this is another basic reason for our special interest in his country, an interest which, he stressed, will be a continuing one in his administration.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d275-02" facs="d275-02"/>
                        <p>The President referred to his visit to Ethiopia two years ago, when the Emperor had told him that the major threat to his country came from Somalia. The President asked whether the Emperor now thought that a genuine and continuing detente was possible and, if not, whether the U.S. should change its policy towards Somalia.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor replied that he was very much aware of and sympathetic to the Presidentʼs problem with the Congress. He remarked with a smile that he had read a great deal on this subject and had come here in full knowledge of these difficulties. However, Ethiopia also has its problems, and timely assistance now can avert much greater difficulties for the future. The Emperor suggested that perhaps these problems could be explained in camera to the Congress in ways that would result in a more sympathetic Congressional response. He had not come to request extensive military assistance, although there were certain requirements which he had in the counter-insurgency field in order to enable Ethiopia to offset superior weaponry which the ELF and the Somalis had in certain categories. He was well aware that Ethiopiaʼs basic requirement was for economic and social development and, while the country must strengthen its defenses, it is even more important that it increase its rate of. growth. In this field, Ethiopia looked to the U.S. for substantial assistance.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Somalia, the Emperor underlined his deep concern at the extent of Soviet military assistance. Somalia is a small nation of less than two million people and has no need for armed forces of the size and sophistication that Soviet assistance has made possible. Moreover, Soviet assistance has brought extensive influence in its wake. Ethiopia had been among the first to sponsor the independence of Somalia and had always extended a hand of friendship to it. He continued to hope that the detente could work out and he thought that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> shared these views. He did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> was under Soviet influence but he thought that there were dangers that other forces in Somalia which are under Soviet influence could nullify <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs constructive influences in ways that would pose great dangers for Ethiopia. Ethiopia had to be prepared for such a contingency.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d275-03" facs="d275-03"/>
                        <p>The President asked what foreign influences the Emperor thought posed the greatest dangers to Ethiopia in the area, the Soviets, the Chinese or the Egyptians?</p>
                        <p>The Emperor responded without hesitation that he thought the Soviets posed the principal threat. Their influence is strong in both Somalia and the Sudan, as well as in important parts of the Arabian peninsular. Their vessels have penetrated the Red Sea. Working through the UAR as a client state, he feared that they wished to make that body of water a Soviet-Egyptian lake. The Emperor went on to say that when he had visited Moscow two years ago he had asked the Soviet leadership very bluntly why they were pouring arms into neighboring countries in ways that posed threats to Ethiopiaʼs leadership. The Soviets had denied any unfriendly intentions and had told the Emperor that he had only to request Soviet military assistance in order to receive it. The Emperor continued by stressing his own awareness of the dangers of Ethiopia turning away from its traditional friends as a source of military assistance and of accepting such equipment from the Soviets. He continued to wish to avoid such a situation and, instead, to look to his traditional friends to be responsive to Ethiopiaʼs needs. The same consideration was true with respect to economic assistance. The Soviets had made available to him a $100 million line of credit several years ago, but Ethiopia had only drawn down a very small portion of this amount. As with military assistance, Ethiopia wishes to continue to rely on her tried and traditional friends. At the same time, the government is under tremendous pressures from the Ethiopian people who yearn for security and for a hastened pace of development. They will not be able to understand if the government is not able to show progress in both fields.</p>
                        <p>The President responded by saying that both Ethiopia and the United States have the same objective - a stable, secure and prosperous Ethiopia. He well understood the internal psychological problem posed for the Emperor and his government by the attitudes of the Ethiopian people. The Emperor could be confident that we would bear the same considerations in mind in addressing ourselves to the question of how, we can most effectively cooperate with his country.</p>
                        <p>The President continued by emphasizing our concern over the Nigerian situation and asked whether the Emperor had any advice for us on this problem.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d275-04" facs="d275-04"/>
                        <p>The Emperor reviewed the history of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and his own involvement in this problem, citing the various efforts which the Consultative Committee had made under his chairmanship to bring about peace. He had been most hopeful at the last meeting in Monrovia that the Committee would be able to get agreement on a formula which would provide an acceptable degree of autonomy for Biafra within the framework of a united Nigeria. Unfortunately this effort had not been successful.</p>
                        <p>The President asked where the blame lay for failure to reach agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor replied by saying that if he had to reduce the question to a mathematical formulation he would say that about 80 percent of the fault lay with the Biafrans and about 20 percent with the <gloss target="#t_FMG1">FMG</gloss> which had shown itself much more flexible, including willingness to approve measures that would protect the Ibo population. The Emperor went on to say that, although the tragic conflict in Nigeria was primarily a tribal problem, it had been vastly complicated by the activities of certain of the great powers. Making clear that he did not include the U.S. in this assessment., the Emperor expressed his understanding and appreciation of the American role in providing humanitarian assistance. The views of the U.S. in this matter coincided exactly with his own and he welcomed the move that the President had made in appointing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FCCJ1">Ferguson</persName> as relief coordinator.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor continued by emphasizing the importance he attached to the U.S. bringing pressure to bear on both parties to the conflict to get them back to the negotiating table. The Consultative Committee had not given up on the problem and was ready to resume negotiations at any time. He felt sure that the U.S. could be helpful in bringing both parties together, perhaps in cooperation with other powers. The Emperor concluded by referring to his recent meeting with the. Pope who had promised that if the Emperor could bring the two sides together again, he personally would be willing to attend the conference and use his influence on behalf of a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>After thanking the Emperor the President asked for his views on the situation in the Middle East.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d275-05" facs="d275-05"/>
                        <p>The Emperor emphasized that he thought the present situation was fraught with danger. He feared that unless a settlement were soon achieved, the situation would polarize with the U.S. and the Soviets increasingly facing a confrontation in the area. The Emperor continued by referring to his recent visit to Cairo. At that time he had told President Nasser bluntly that the UAR is the key to the Arab position and that it must face reality. The reality, the Emperor said, is the existence of Israel which has been recognized by all the great powers, by much of the rest of the world and is a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Under the circumstances, he had told Nasser, the Arabs were simply not facing up to facts in their refusal to recognize the existence of Israel.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor continued by saying that Ethiopia strongly supported the Security Council resolution of November 22, 1967 which it regarded as the charter for a viable peace in the Middle East. At the same time, Ethiopia could understand why the Arabs found difficulty in sitting down in direct negotiations with Israel while Israeli forces were in occupation of Sinai, Gaza, the West Bank, and Syrian territory. He was also aware from his conversations with Nasser and with Eban of the suspicions which both sides had of the four power talks. Both sides are concerned that they do not know everything that is going on and fear that their respective vital interests may be prejudiced without their knowledge or consent. To help in this situation, the Emperor had proposed to Nasser (and subsequently to Eban) that a new body be set up comprising the four powers plus a number of small powers appointed equally by the Arab states and Israel. The role of the small powers would be to assure that the interest of both parties to the conflict were given full consideration. This new body, the Emperor suggested, could serve a mediating function in seeking a solution based on the November 22 resolution. The Emperor concluded by saying that both Nasser and Eban had asked whether, if such a body were set up, Ethiopia would be willing to serve on it, and the Emperor had replied affirmatively.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the Emperor contemplated that the new peace machinery which he had proposed would function inside or outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d275-06" facs="d275-06"/>
                        <p>The Emperor replied that he saw a fundamental difficulty here. The Security Council has responsibility for the problem within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. While it too is composed of the great powers and smaller powers, it obviously is not constituted along the lines of the Emperorʼs proposals and therefore could not effectively perform the functions which he had proposed. He therefore thought that any body along the lines of his proposals would have to function outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> framework although it would, of course, have the November 22 resolution as its charter.</p>
                        <p>In thanking the Emperor, the President said that he knew that he was due at a luncheon. He looked forward to seeing him at dinner this evening and at their second meeting tomorrow which would give opportunities for continuing these very helpful discussions. After emphasizing the importance which he and his administration place on the Emperorʼs views and advice, the President once again underlined the importance which he attached to Ethiopia both for its leadership in Africa and as a constructive force in the world.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor thanked the President most warmly, stressing his satisfaction with their conversation. He had come to the U.S., as always, in friendship and, as a friend, had spoken frankly about Ethiopian and other world problems. He particularly appreciated the Presidentʼs generosity in the amount of time he had devoted to these discussions and the understanding which the President had shown. He too looked forward to the further conversations which he was sure would contribute greatly to a strengthening of the relationship between the two countries.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Study Group Report on Kagnew Station, forwarded by <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss> 122-69, dated 5 March 1969, has been reviewed.</p>
                        <p>The paramount objective of consolidating communications at Kagnew Station, Asmara, is to achieve the maximum reduction of our presence at Kagnew and the amount of real estate required for communications without sacrificing operational effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the consolidation recommendations set forth in the Study are predicated upon the retention at Kagnew of the U.S. Army Strategic Communications Command Facility to handle DCS communications and the Naval Communication Station for Naval broadcast and ship/shore communications. This dual Service operation is not consistent with the consolidation objective stated above. In view of the fact that the Navy has sufficient unique tactical requirements to require their continued communications operations at Asmara and the Army has no communications requirements other than the DCS, I consider that our objective can best be realized by the assumption by Navy of the DCS responsibility and the phase-out of the Army Strategic Communications Command Facility.</p>
                        <p>Through this single Service communications responsibility, it is estimated that we will be able to return to the Government of Ethiopia an additional 90 acres of land and reduce our presence by at least an additional 85 manpower spaces over that which would appear to be possible through the dual Service collocated operation recommended in the Study.</p>
                        <p>Relative to the consolidation of facilities, I concur in that portion of the Study which recommends deactivation of those high frequency (HF) trunks no longer justifiable, the replacement of HF trunks by satellite communications to the maximum extent feasible and the consolidation<lb/>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d276-02" facs="d276-02"/>of all remaining HF transmitting facilities at the present Navy transmitter site and HF receiving facilities at the receiver site presently being operated by the Army Strategic Communications Command Facility.</p>
                        <p>As an initial measure, it is requested that the Defense Communications Agency review all the Asmara HF trunks, and on a continuing basis de-activate those no longer required in order that the minimum number of HF trunks will have to be accommodated at the consolidated sites. In this regard, it was noted by an on-site survey that the DCS satellite trunk from Asmara to Landstuhl, Germany, recently upgraded from five to eleven channels, is operating at sub-standard effectiveness due in large part to the lack of a reliable power source meeting DCA requirements. Raising the efficiency of the satellite trunk to Landstuhl will alleviate HF circuitry by enabling deactivating or placing in a standby status the present HF trunk to Landstuhl. Accordingly, it is requested that the Army accomplish during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 their improvement project for the provision of permanent primary power to the Strategic Communications Command Facilityʼs satellite communications site by a cable from the adjacent Navy transmitter site. This minor installation improvement meets the requirements set forth in Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum of 6 September 1968.</p>
                        <p>To accomplish our overall communications objective at Kagnew Station, Asmara, it is requested that the Navy, in coordination with the DCA, the Army and the State Department (relative to DTS facilities), develop an engineering plan for the consolidation of communications functions and facilities based on the following guidelines:</p>
                        <p>a. The Naval Communication Station, Asmara to assume responsibility for the DCS function with the subsequent phase-out of the Army Strategic Communications Command Facility.</p>
                        <p>b. All HF radio transmitting functions be consolidated at the Navy transmitter site; all HF radio receiving functions be consolidated at the present Army receiver site.</p>
                        <p>c. Consolidation to be based on the maximum feasible use of satellite circuitry and retention of only those HF trunks absolutely required.</p>
                        <p>d. Relocation/reconfiguration of sites to be held to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>e. Navy manpower space increases occasioned by assumption of the DCS function to be held to absolute minimum.</p>
                        <p>f. Maximum use to be made of transportable facilities.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d276-03" facs="d276-03"/>
                        <p>g. Provision be made for the orderly transition of DCS responsibility, with Navy programming for one-time costs in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72 and assuming complete operation and maintenance responsibility for communications by the last quarter of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72.</p>
                        <p>h. Reduction of acreage required for communications use, operating costs and manpower savings which would be realized are to be identified.</p>
                        <p>It is further requested that the consolidation plan be forwarded to OSD for review within ninety days.</p>
                        <p>The recommendation of the Study that the Joint Chiefs of Staff be assigned the responsibility for the annual review of the telecommunications portion of the Contingency Relocation Plans for the Kagnew Station Complex is approved.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>By a Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum of 6 September 1968 (higher classification), the Joint Chiefs of Staff were requested to prepare a study toward consolidating communications functions at Kagnew Station, Asmara, Ethiopia in order to reduce our presence at Kagnew and the amount of real estate required for communications. The study was also to address the feasibility of transferring responsibility for Defense Communications System (DCS) facilities to the Navy.</p>
                        <p>By TAB A, the Joint Chiefs of Staff forwarded the subject Study Group Report on Kagnew. This Study recommends consolidation of communications facilities with all HF transmitters to be consolidated at the Navy transmitter site and all HF receivers to be at the Army Strategic Communications Command Facility (USASTRATCOMFAC) receiver site. The Study, however, recommends that both Services continue their communications operation, but on a collocated basis. No supporting rationale for this dual Service operation is offered.</p>
                        <p>The consolidation of facilities as proposed in the Study is concurred in. All sites were visited in May by the Director for Telecommunications Policy, OASD(I&amp;L), and a member of his staff. However, this visit showed clearly that there is no justification for the continuation of USASTRATCOMFACʼs operation. Their DCS function, which is their sole responsibility, can be absorbed by the Naval Communications Station (NAVCOMMSTA) in addition to its tactical commitments at a significant savings in costs, personnel and acreage required. Expected reductions in acreage and personnel are contrasted as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d276-05" facs="d276-05"/>
                        <p>Dual Service (Collocated) Single Service (Navy)</p>
                        <p>(a) Reduction in Acreage</p>
                        <p>Exclusive use - 28 acres 69 acres</p>
                        <p>Nonexclusive use - 952 acres 1001 acres</p>
                        <p>Total - 980 acres 1070 acres</p>
                        <p>(b) Reduction in Manpower Spaces - 75 160</p>
                        <p>As shown, the Single Service operation is expected to result in a savings of an additional 90 acres and 85 manpower spaces.</p>
                        <p>The attached proposed memorandum is forwarded for your approval. It accomplishes the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Advises that the consolidation of communications sites is concurred in as recommended, but that Dual Service operation is not approved.</p>
                        <p>b. Tasks the DCA to deactivate as many Asmara HF trunks as feasible.</p>
                        <p>c. Tasks the Army to accomplish a power improvement program in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 for provision of reliable power to its satellite terminal. Estimated cost is $150, 000. This should enable replacement of one HF trunk by satellite circuitry and, in addition, provide an estimated $125, 000 savings in O&amp;M annually.</p>
                        <p>d. Tasks the Navy to prepare, within 90 days, in coordination with DCA, Army and State Department, an engineering plan for single Service consolidation of communications at Kagnew with maximum emphasis on satellite communications. Navyʼs assumption of complete O&amp;M responsibility is set at <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72 to coincide with the installation of Phase II DSCS satellite terminals.</p>
                        <p>e. Approves the recommendation that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> be assigned responsibility for the annual review of the telecommunications portion of the Contingency Relocation Plans for the Kagnew Station Complex. These contingency plans were prepared within <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> at the request of the State Department in 1968.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that you sign the attached memorandum. It has been coordinated with the Principal Deputies of OASD(A), OASD(<gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>), OASD(C), and OASD(<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>).</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AAS1">Abdirashid Ali Shermarke</persName>, President of the Somali Republic, was assassinated October 15. President of the National Assembly, Sheikh Muktar, is next in line constitutionally and is taking charge. Somali Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>, third in line, is still in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> and the Somali Ambassador, Azhari who is the son-in-law of President Shermarke have been informed. Egal is expected to leave immediately for Mogadiscio.</p>
                        <p>President Shermarke fully supported <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs detente policy. Peace in the Horn of Africa during the past two years has been important to us because of our interests in Ethiopia. A new president, according to the constitution, is to be elected within thirty days. Likely candidates include former President Osman, a former Prime Minister, and <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> himself. All these possibilities are pro-West and likely to continue the detente.</p>
                        <p>A Muslim country burial within a short period (twenty-four hours) is likely. Hence a request for high level representation at a state funeral is not expected.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We still lack detailed information on the murder of President Shermarke of Somali. But the intelligence yields the following points:</p>
                        <p>-- Despite tribal resentment toward the governmentʼs detente with Ethiopia and the rancor of the losers over a bitterly contested parliamentary election in March, the assassin -- a member of the Mobile Police Force -- appears to have been acting on his own.</p>
                        <p>-- An army (anti-detente) takeover in the near future is not likely. The possibility remains, however, that there will be some inter-tribal fighting if the assassin turns out to be from a major tribal group opposed to Shermarke on ethnic rather than political grounds.</p>
                        <p>-- The National Assembly will elect a new President within 30 days. All leading candidates are pro-Western, and would probably continue Somaliaʼs ties with us as well as a conciliatory policy toward Ethiopia over the disputed border.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>, whom you saw last week, is now flying home from California. His return should have a general calming effect on the country.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Elements of the Somali Army and police seined power early this morning from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs elected government. First reports are very sketchy. The following is the sum of our intelligence up to the moment</p>
                        <p>-- The coup followed immediately upon a report split to <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs governing party over the nomination of a successor for assassinated President Shermarke.</p>
                        <p>-- But there is no evidence that the Army acted on behalf of, or in specific opposition to, either of the factions in <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs party. <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs whereabouts are unknown, and the Somali radio has wed simply that the country will be governed by “military council”.</p>
                        <p>-- Nor is there evidence that the coup is related to the earlier assassination. The only radio broadcast so far by the new regime referred to general corruption and cited the assassination as an example of the breakdown of the civilian government.</p>
                        <p>-- The initial broadcast says the new regime will respect all foreign policy obligations, but also pledges aid to “freedom fighters”, which almost certainly is a reversal of <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs dote with Ethiopia over disputed border territories.</p>
                        <p>-- Thus far the coup has been bloodless. Our Embassy reports all Americans safe. Our Ambassador is meeting with other members of the diplomatic corps this afternoon to hear a forma1 statement from a spokesman of the new government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Implications for US Interests</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Judgments at this point are clearly premature, but my own guess is that this is yet another group of young officers who will remain quietly in the background. They were probably moved in part by disagreement with <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs policy of detente, in part by resentment of the inevitable corruption and inefficiency of African democracies (even in a model government like Somaliaʼs). The assassination and then the apparent disarray among <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs <pb n="2" xml:id="d279-02" facs="d279-02"/>followers over the succession offered a rare opportunity.</p>
                        <p>For the US, of course, the most important element will be the survival or the collapse of the detente. ICE the Somalis returned to bellicose irredentism (as these first signs seem to suggest), tension will rise throughout the area, including Kenya as well as Ethiopia. The old arms supply spiral could then begin again -- with the Somalis going to the Soviets, the Ethiopians to us, the Kenyans to the British.</p>
                        <p>Having tried detente and failed, Haile Selassie will probably find it impossible to hold his own hard-liners is check. And if the two sides slip back into belligerence, we should expect the Ethiopians to put our interests on the line -- the important communications facility at Kagnew -- in asking for increased military assistance. As the Somalis modernize their arms, and as Ethiopia diverts more of our help and their own resources to weapons rather than economic development, the only real be beneficiary is the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>I will have a further situation report for you as soon as we have more details.</p>

                        <p>Somali Proverb: A force of cavalry will always find unguarded camels.</p>
                        <p>The apparently bloodless coup which overthrew the government of Somalia came within 24 hours of the burial of assassinated President Abdirashid All Shermarke and put an end to the efforts of civilian politicians to reach agreement on a new president. One of the last states in Africa with legitimate claim to a democratic system of government has now turned to military rule. The takeover is likely to endanger the politically courageous attempt, launched two years ago by Shermarke and his Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Mohamed Ibrahim Egal</persName>, to ease Somaliaʼs irredentist problems through detente with Kenya and Ethiopia.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Coup.</hi>The army moved early on October 21, 1969, to seize control of the government, the radio, transport centers and other key installations. Later, a Revolutionary Council, composed of army and police, proclaimed a state of emergency, dissolved the National Assembly, and suspended the Constitution. All ministers--presumably including <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>--are under house arrest. The Revolutionary Council announced over Radio Mogadiscio that it would “respect all treaties and agreements made with friendly countries…maintain a policy of non-alignment, self-determination, and non-interference…and provide help and support to all freedom-fighters.”</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Motivation.</hi> Coup leaders claim to have acted in order to put an end to widespread corruption and to “abolish tribalism.” The new regimeʼs desire to support freedom fighters suggests that discontent with the detente may also have been a motive.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Leadership.</hi> Given the armyʼs power, it is probably the senior partner in its alliance with the police. According to a regime spokesman, Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, the army commandant, and Major General Jama Ali Korshel, the police commandant, are working closely together on the Council. The names of additional members are not yet available. Siad, an outspoken critic of the detente, and Korshel may have engineered the coup or may turn out to be figureheads for a younger group of officers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Implications.</hi> In defiance of <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs policy, Siadʼs army has in the past, undercut the detente with Ethiopia by covertly arming Arussi Galla rebels operating in Southwestern Ethiopia. It is generally believed that most army officers, and perhaps a number of police, have looked unfavorably upon the detente. As a consequence, a return to the expansionist policies of the pre-Egal era may be in store. Even should a newly-emergent group of army leaders be willing to experiment further with the detente, they would encounter reawakened Ethiopian suspicions.</p>
                        <p>The coup may also provide increased opportunities for the Soviets. A large percentage of army officers have undergone training in the Soviet Union. While it is doubtful that a significant number are communists, many may be susceptible to Soviet. influence. Furthermore. army officers have long yearned<lb/>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d280-03" facs="d280-03"/>for more sophisticated military equipment to offset Ethiopiaʼs superior forces and may now wish to acquire greater military aid from the Soviets. The Soviets might well comply with the request of an irredentist Somali regime, particularly in view of the American presence in Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>Somaliaʼs nomadic tribes are heavily armed and could resist army authority. Moreover, the army is tribally divided and could itself be hard put to maintain its unity should serious tribal disorders develop. The emergence of tribal tension, ever present in Somalia, coupled with the political upheavals of recent days could usher in a period of serious unrest.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>State has asked us to clear the attached cable instructing low-key recognition of the new military government in Somalia. The Italians and British have already recognized. The French, Germans, Ethiopians and Kenyans are about to move. Our Embassy reports that the coup leaders are likely to ask us formally in the next few days where we stand.</p>
                        <p>As you know, our intelligence is still foggy on the intentions or the exact personnel of the new regime. Even if the young officers tolerate the border detente or keep their distance from the Soviets, our relations are bound to be somewhat strained over the next few months. At worst, there could be frontier warfare with Ethiopia and a new round of the arms race in The Horn.</p>
                        <p>Yet I canʼt see how we could use our recognition to forestall any of these potential problems. On the contrary, snubbing the new government might only drive them faster toward a radical and belligerent posture. So far, we have escaped direct criticism, and they seem to want a continuation of the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>I think the State cable strikes the right pose. We would sidle back into routine relations without public announcement, and confirm formal recognition only if the Somalis ask us.</p>
                        <p>In short, this new government is in the saddle. It might still follow a responsible policy in the region, despite its irredentist cast. We have nothing to gain -- and maybe something to lose -- by playing, coy on the recognition issue when other Westerners and Africans are coming around.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you clear the attached cable.</p>

                        <p>In response to your concern over the welfare of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>, I asked <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName> to send out an urgent instruction, and our Embassy in Somalia answered this morning. (Tab A)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> is under closely-guarded house arrest. He apparently escaped harm during the coup and has been treated decently so far, including retention of his household servants. Our embassy has not probed further than this -- and expression of our concern was kept low key to avoid any reaction by the coup leadership that could jeopardize <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>. The new regime is bound to be suspicious of an attempted restoration in these early days (especially by what they see as a US/Ethiopian alliance), and I think we have made our point about <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName>ʼs treatment with a discreet inquiry.</p>
                        <p>We still know very little about the new government or its intentions. No strong man has emerged and the power seems to lie with a group of young colonels trained in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Italy. The Italians (whose intelligence is solid from their colonial tie to Somalia) report that these officers are mainly moderates who will try to clear away domestic corruption without changing the detente with Ethiopia or opening the door to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>As of this morning, public statements from the new regime have not gone beyond what I reported to you earlier -- an emphasis on restoring political integrity, but no specifics on foreign or domestic policies.</p>

                            <item>GENERAL SIADʼS VIEWS ON US-SOMALI RELATIONS</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. IN LINE WITH SUGGESTIONS RECEIVED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES THAT I SEEK TO DISPEL SOME OF SUPREME REVOLUTIONARY COUNCILʼS SUSPICION OF US INTENTIONS AND ACTIVITIES, I MET WITH SRC PRESIDENT GENERAL SIAD ON JAN 26 FOR LONG, RAMBLING, FRIENDLY AND NOT VERY CONCLUSIVE CONVERSATION.</p>
                        <p>2. AFTER INTRODUCING <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> DENNIS I DISCUSSED WEB OF SUSPICION WHICH I HAD HEARD FALSE INFORMERS WERE WEAVING. I BRANDED AS COMPLETELY FALSE THE THEME THAT (l) USG IS HOSTILE TO THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT. I CITED NOT ONLY OUR EFFORTS TO BE EVEN-HANDED TOWARD VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN POWER IN SOMALIA BUT OUR ENDORSEMENT OF THE AIMS OF THE SRC. I DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CHARGE USG WAS CUTTING ITS AID AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN SOMALIA AND URGING OTHERS TO DO LIKEWISE IS PATENTLY NONSENSE. HERE I CITED USG WILLINGNESS TO CANCEL PHASE-OUT OF AID PROGRAMS AND DESCRIBED OUR ENCOURAGEMENT OF US PRIVATE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. I EMPHASIZED THAT IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY COUNTER TO OUR POLICY OF PEACE AND PROS <pb n="2" xml:id="d283-02" facs="d283-02"/>PERITY IN THE HORN TO DISCOURAGE OTHERS FROM ASSISTING SOMALIA. WE BELIEVED SOMALIAʼS DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND PROSPERITY COULD BEST BE SERVED BY SUPPORT FROM AS WIDE A FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL AND BILATERAL DONERS AS POSSIBLE. FINALLY I CITED FALSE RUMORS RESPECTING USG SUPPORT FOR ETHIOPIAN MILITARY MOVES AND FLATLY DENIED EITHER KNOWLEDGE OF OR SUPPORT FOR THEM.</p>
                        <p>3. GENERAL SIAD EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR THE FRANK STATEMENT. HE RECOUNTED AT SOME LENGTH HIS REASONING AS TO WHY THE “COMMON PEOPLE” OF SOMALIA ARE ALLEGEDLY ANTI-US. HE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO THOUGHTLESS BEHAVIOR OVER THE YEARS OF EMPLOYEES OF US PROSPECTING FIRMS. NOT UNDERSTANDING NOMADS AND POORER PEOPLE, THEY HAD OFFENDED THEIR PRIDE AND DISREGARDED THEIR PROPERTY. POORER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LESS AWARE OF MORE REPRESENTATIVE US PRESENCE OF INTELLECTUALS AND DIPLOMATS. HE ADMITTED THERE WERE MANY RUMORS AND THEY MADE JOB OF SRC MORE DIFFICULT BUT THOSE WHO CIRCULATE THEM WOULD RE PUT IN THEIR CORRECT PLACE. SRC COULD NOT DISPEL FEELINGS OP POORER PEOPLE OVERNIGHT BUT MUST ACT IN BEST INTERESTS OF COUNTRY AS WHOLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF HUNGER, DISEASE AND IGNORANCE.</p>
                        <p>4. SOMALIA WAS READY TO ACCEPT ASSISTANCE FROM A VARIETY OF DONORS, AND HE HOPED A RICH AND POWERFUL COUNTRY LIKE THE US COULD GIVE MORE. THEN HE REITERATED THAT IT MUST BE SOMALIA WHICH DECIDES HOW ASSISTANCE IS TO BE USED OR OTHERWISE IT WOULD NOT RE USED FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE. HE REPEATED THIS THEME WITH SEVERAL VARIATIONS AND EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT US AND OTHERS WOULD UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THIS DESIRE OF SOMALIA TO MAKE ITS OWN DECISIONS.</p>
                        <p>5. SIAD SOUGHT TO BRUSH AWAY ANY IMPLICATION THAT SOMALIA MAY BE DOMINATED BY SOVIETS THROUGH <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. HE SAID THAT FACT OF THESE PROGRAMS COULD NEVER FORCE HIM A MOSLEM TO BECOME COMMUNIST. HE EXPANDED ON HIS AND THE SRCʼS LOVE OF FREEDOM AND DETERMINATION TO AVOID INTERFERENCE FROM ABROAD.</p>
                        <p>6. WHEREAS SIAD STRESSED HIS NEED TO REFLECT THE VIEWS OF THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE ON DOMESTIC MATTERS, HE SAID IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIM AND OF SAID TO PREVENT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN ETHIOPIA AND SOMALIA. HE SAID WITH FEELING THAT THE TWO PEOPLES MUST LIVE SIDE BY SIDE IN PEACE FOR THE AGES. HE COMMENTED WITHOUT RANCOR ON US MILITARY AID TO ETHIOPIA AND CONSEQUENT SOVIET MILITARY AID TO SOMALIA. HE WISHED ALL THESE ARMS COULD BE DROPPED INTO THE OCEAN.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d283-03" facs="d283-03"/>
                        <p>7. SIAD GAVE VAGUE ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. HE SAID THAT<lb/>
QUESTION OF RECOGNITION OF THE VIET NAM NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IS PENDING ACTION IN THE SRC. (I HAD TOLD HIM THAT SUCH RECOGNITION AND THE SOMALI FLAG SHIPPING PROBLEM COULD GREATLY COMPLICATE THE ATMOSPHERE IN USG FOR AID TO SOMALIA.) HE MADE NO SUBSTANTIVE COMMENT ON FLAG SHIPPING. I ALSO CITED AS A PROBLEM BIAS IN THE PRESS. HE CLAIMED THAT 90 PER CENT OF WHAT IS IN THE PRESS DOES NOT RPT NOT REPRESENT GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE SAID DIFFICULTY IS LACK OF TRAINED JOURNALISTS -- SOMETIMES ALSO WRITERS LET REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR GET BETTER OF ANY GOOD SENSE OF RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>8. IN EFFORT TO GIVE TALK POSITIVE ASPECTS I MENTIONED VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES OPENING UP FOR SOMALIA AND US TO WORK TOGETHER, SUCH AS EXCHANGE OF PERSONS AND LEADER GRANTS. PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM, SELF-HELP PROJECTS AND REGIONAL RANGE MANAGEMENT.</p>
                        <p>9. COMMENT: GENERAL SIAD SOUGHT EARNESTLY TO CONVINCE US OF HIS INDEPENDENCE AND NATIONAL SPIRIT AS WELL AS DESIRE IMPROVE US-SOMALI RELATIONS. PATIENCE AND WORK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOOD, HEALTH AND EDUCATION WHICH HIS PEOPLE NEEDED AND THAT EFFORT COUPLED <pb n="4" xml:id="d283-04" facs="d283-04"/>WITH NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE WAS ABOVE ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT. DISCLAIMING ANY DICTATORIAL AMBITIONS, SAID EMPHASIZED THAT HE MERELY WANTED TO SERVE HIS PEOPLE. I BELIEVE THIS FRANK DISCUSSION WAS WORTHWHILE BOTH IN SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON SUSPICIONS REGARDING US AND IN SEEKING TO DEVELOP BETTER UNDERSTANDING WITH SRC.</p>

Department of the Navy memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, 18 December 1969, subject: Engineering Plan for Navy Assumption of DCS Functions and Consolidation of HF Transmitting and Receiving Functions Under the Navy at Kagnew Station, Asmara, Ethiopia.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend your reconsideration of the decision, reference a, which directed assumption by Navy of Army responsibilities for operation and maintenance of Defense Communications System (DCS) facilities in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that consolidation of DCS facilities at Kagnew Station be deferred indefinitely and Service assignments at Kagnew Station remain unchanged. My reasons are briefly as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. In reference b, Navy estimates the cost of consolidation at $4.9 million. These funds are unprogrammed. Austerity of current programs and drastically reduced funding resources raise serious questions as to the value of pursuing consolidation actions at Kagnew Station.</p>
                        <p>b. U.S. tenure agreement will expire in 1978; however, it may be abrogated prior to that time at the discretion of the Ethiopian Parliament.</p>
                        <p>c. Overall reduction in manpower is negligible.</p>
                        <p>d. Visibility of U.S. presence may well be increased by the arrival on station of additional Navy personnel.</p>

                        <p>NOTE: Complete distribution made in CMS on 4/8/70</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Azhari called on the Secretary at his request to say farewell in view of his imminent departure for Mogadiscio on transfer. He spoke in glowing terms of his 3-1/2 years in the United States and was most complimentary concerning the assistance and understanding consistently given him by State Department officials.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by the Secretary concerning prospects for a continuation of the detente in the Horn, Ambassador Azhari stated he was most pleased that the detente initiated by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> in 1967 was being fully upheld by the present Somali Government. He stated his belief that the idea of detente with Somaliaʼs neighbors had taken root among the Somali people far more deeply than generally realized and that it would continue to be a fundamental basis of Somali foreign policy. He was delighted at this prospect and was convinced it was of utmost importance not only to his own country but to Ethiopia and Kenya as well.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Azhari then said he hoped the Secretary would not mind his raising a problem of great concern to him personally and to the future of U.S.-Somali relations, namely, the involvement of Somali flag vessels in trade with North Vietnam. The Ambassador reviewed the problem in some detail, pointing out that the previous government had fully realized the importance of the issue and had undertaken firm steps to bring the trade to an end. Most unfortunately, the new government which came into power last October had not continued that policy. The Ambassador explained that in his view General Siadʼs (President of the Supreme Revolutionary Council - SRC) hands were tied by the preponderance on the SRC of young, ultra-nationalistic and <pb n="2" xml:id="d285-02" facs="d285-02"/>inexperienced military officers who had no appreciation of the complexities of the issue and its importance to U.S.-Somali relations. They were, moreover, considerably influenced by Soviet advisors. Unfortunately, any formal approach to General SIAD on the issue by the USG would, in his view, produce a negative reply. In fact, he greatly feared that any direct confrontation on this issue might well result in a rupture of diplomatic relations. The Ambassador pleaded for forbearance on the part of the USG, pointing out that a rupture of relations would leave the field wide open for the further growth of Soviet influence in his country. The Soviets were already making serious inroads; the removal of the U.S. presence could only further strengthen this deplorable trend. He shuddered to think of what effects this would have on Somaliaʼs current policy of detente and on the future peace in the Horn.</p>
                        <p>The Somali people, the Ambassador insisted, were basically friendly to the West. By tradition they were strongly independent minded and individualistic. The present government did not represent their feelings, and dissatisfaction with the regime was clearly growing. He believed that changes in the government were inevitable. The new government, he hoped, would more clearly reflect the friendliness of the population towards the West and would likely be more amen-able to a satisfactory solution of the shipping problem. If only the United States could defer action on the problem until that time, it would be in the best long-range interests of both countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that we were concerned by the recent reappearance of Somali flag vessels in the North Vietnam trade. The USG was eager to maintain good relations with Somalia. Nevertheless, the Congress had laid down very explicit instructions with regard to aid to countries whose ships were engaged in such trade and the State Department was obliged to follow the law. He asked the Ambassador what benefits accrued to the Somali Government by permitting its flag vessels to engage in such trade.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that the monetary return to his government was negligible. He pointed out that the principal benefit accrued to a French firm, which had secured the contract some years ago. But the issue was considered a matter of national sovereignty and prestige. The SRC, and particularly its younger members, would clearly resent any dictation by an outside power as to where Somali flag vessels could or could not travel. That is why he so feared a direct confrontation on the issue at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by stating it seemed a pity that Somalia had permitted itself to get caught in a situation of so little tangible benefit to it. He reiterated that we would carefully consider all aspects of the matter during the review of the problem which was now under way.</p>

                        <p>1. Assistant Secretary Newsom conveyed to Italian Ambassador Ortona April 16 USG decision re termination of aid to Somalia under Section 620(n) of FAA as outlined reftel. Stressed that considerable flexibility re method of presentation decision to <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HFL1">Hadsel</persName> and that no ultimatum or formal demarche on shipping issue necessarily required. Added that under Section 617 orderly phase out projects now under way would be permitted.</p>
                        <p>2. Turning to possible rupture diplomatic relations by <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> as result this decision, which US strongly hoped would not take place, Newsom suggested that if anybody were in position to counsel moderation to <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> in this respect it would be appreciated. Pointed out that recent experience <pb n="2" xml:id="d286-02" facs="d286-02"/>had shown it far easier to break relations than to arrange for their restoration. Moreover, if <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> were to break relations it would be even more difficult to restore assistance in future, even if shipping problem could be satisfactorily resolved. He hoped that <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> would think most carefully before taking any such drastic action.</p>
                        <p>3. Although expressing sorrow at US decision, Ambassador Ortona indicated it was not unexpected. His government believed that in view policy trends clearly evident in Somalia now, as indicated most recently by recognition East Germany, this was particularly sensitive time for such US move. He feared it might well result in rupture diplomatic relations, if not worse reactions. Although doubtful Italian Ambassador in Mogadiscio would be in a position to exercise constructive influence on <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss>, he would immediately report conversation and was certain <pb n="3" xml:id="d286-03" facs="d286-03"/>that Ambassador would do what he could to be helpful.

                        <p>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. The Horn of Africa is an area of chronic tensions and instability. Existing religious, national, political and ideological divisions are exacerbated by powerful animosities stemming from the Middle East conflict and the involvement of Israel and the Arab states in the Horn. US and Israeli military aid to Ethiopia is seen by Sudan and Somalia as an imperialist conspiracy, and is viewed by anti-establishment groups in Ethiopia as a prop for <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>. Sudan and Somalia look to the radical Arab states for advice and are armed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. In Ethiopia, the most important country in the Horn, Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> is managing to hold down the dissidence of students, bureaucrats, young intellectuals, and some within the military. There is always a possibility of a military coup. He also faces a long-festering insurgency in the province of Eritrea dominated by local Moslems and armed and funded by radical Arab states. The insurgents are not likely to achieve their goals, nor can the central government eliminate the rebels.</p>
                        <p>C. Kagnew Station, a major US communications base in Eritrea, is vulnerable to attack, but is not now directly threatened. We do not, however, discount the possibility of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> taking a more hostile attitude towards the US, nor do we rule out the possibility of isolated attacks on US persons or property by ultrazealous individuals or bands.</p>
                        <p>D. The death of the 78-year old <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> will inevitably alter the situation in the Horn. His son, the Crown Prince, will probably succeed him, but unless the Crown Prince is supported by both traditional and modernizing forces other contenders would challenge him. Much depends upon the army. If it turns to factional feuding, the central government would lose control, at least temporarily, over some outlying areas. Whatever form the successor government takes, <pb n="6" xml:id="d287-06" facs="d287-06"/>it will face a monumental task in holding together the disparate peoples of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>E. We think that a successor government in Ethiopia would continue to look to the US as its primary backer. In view of the serious internal and external challenges which would confront the post-<persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> regime, it would probably seek emergency support including arms and petroleum from the US, and would probably decide on further US use of Kagnew largely on the basis of the American response.</p>
                        <p>F. Somalia, now governed by an erratic and unstable leftist military council, has recently taken actions hostile to the US, and is increasingly susceptible to Soviet and radical Arab influences. Fearing the US and Ethiopia, it is seeking to reinforce its ties with the Soviet Union, and to strengthen relations with other radical states.</p>
                        <p>G. The Sudanese Government, also a leftist military council, is bogged down in a civil war against blacks in the south and opposed by Arab traditionalists in the north. Both dissident groups have received occasional aid from Ethiopia. Sudan could, and sometimes does, aid the Eritrean insurgents. But both Ethiopia and Sudan have kept such assistance at low levels.</p>
                        <p>H. Somalia generally accepts as a long range goal the annexation of Somali-inhabited lands in Kenya, Ethiopia, and the French Territory of the Afars and Issas (TFAI), and this contributes to the tension. Mogadiscio is unlikely to try to gain these lands until more favorable opportunities arise. If the French were to withdraw from the TFAI, or if the deaths of <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> were followed by civil strife in these countries, Somalia would almost certainly seek territorial gains. This would lead to serious military clashes. Full scale warfare would be difficult because of the distances involved, and the logistic and organizational limitations of all armed force in the area.</p>
                        <p>I. Soviet interest in the area is growing, and is manifested by increasing naval visits and continued military aid to the Moslem states. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has reduced Western influence in Sudan and Somalia, and would like to eliminate the US communications facility at Kagnew. We doubt, however, that the Soviets will be able much to improve their position in Ethiopia, even after the Emperorʼs death. It would be as awkward for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as for the US, if open war broke out in the Horn. Hence we judge that the Soviets will try to restrain the Somalis and Sudanese.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>1. Tensions are normal in the inherently unstable Horn of Africa. This is true of personal, family, clan, and tribal, as well as international relationships. Principal elements of instability center around Ethiopia”restlessness of the modernizing elements, uneasiness about the succession, and concern over the insurgency in Eritrea. Another underlying element of tension is the presence of large Somali populations in certain areas of Kenya, Ethiopia, and the French Territory of the Afars and Issas. The Somali Government generally accepts the Greater Somalia concept and the Irredentist goal of annexing Somali-inhabited lands. Sudan has a role in the Eritrean insurgency in Ethiopia. Also, the major dissidents in Sudan receive sympathy and some aid from Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>2. The existing religious, national, political and ideological divisions in the area are now being exacerbated by powerful animosities stemming from the Middle East conflict and the involvement of Israel and Arab states in the Horn. The resulting polarization of peoples and interests in the Horn is adding a larger dimension of instability and reinforcing tensions. Furthermore, the uneasy peace now prevailing in the Horn is beclouded by uncertainties surrounding the succession to the throne in Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>3. Peace and stability in the Horn of Africa are of more than marginal concern to the US, principally because of Kagn wStation and broader US interests in Ethiopia.* Kagnew, located on the outskirts of Asmara in Ethiopia, provides scientific data, and hard to replace communications facilities serving US installations over a large part of the world. It also performs a variety of other functions of importance to US security. US military and economic aid programs in Ethiopia, taken together, comprise the largest US assistance program in Africa. There are also strong diplomatic reasons for maintaining a US presence in Ethiopia; Addis Ababa has become a kind of capital of black Africa; and Haile Selassie still commands wide respect in Africa and in the Third World in general.</p>
                        <p>II. ETHIOPIA</p>
                        <p>A. The Regime</p>
                        <p>4. Ethiopia, the most important state in the area, is a centralized authoritarian regime, in which a minority of Coptic Christian Amharas holds a predominance of power over a heterogenous collection of peoples. In many respects”education, skills, literacy, economic infrastructure, and development it ranks near the bottom even among underdeveloped countries. Yet it is unique in Africa for its historic continuity and the pervasive impact of feudal and Imperial traditions on a large proportion of the populace.</p>
                        <p>*Some 3,200 US military and civilian personnel and dependents live at Kagnew, and there are about 2,800 other Americans in Ethiopia.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d287-08" facs="d287-08"/>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>, on the dual basis of the authority of his office and his own shrewd manipulation of nearly everyone and everything in the Ethiopian Government, so far retains fairly effective control over his ramshackle empire. Though nearly 78 years old, with gradually diminishing vigor and flexibility, he still makes all major and most minor decisions, moves ministers, governors, and generals in and out of office, and maintains a network of informants who pervade the government and provide information to the palace. In practice, he is both the chief architect of such modernization as has taken place in Ethiopia and the zealous preserver of an ancient feudal order.</p>
                        <p>6. National priorities and the allotment of budgetary funds to support them are determined by the Emperor.* He particularly favors the armed services, especially the army and air force. Their primary mission, as <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> conceives it, is the conventional defense of land frontiers against hostile armies. He is determined to maintain forces superior to the Soviet-supported armies of neighboring Moslem states. In practice, the army has been more concerned with combating domestic insurgency and unrest. Ethiopian forces are equipped with US weapons of World War II and Korean War vintage, and are hampered by limitations in training and logistics. Poor roads and chronically short <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> supplies restrict the armyʼs mobility. Estimates on the morale of the troops vary from fair to poor, but the great majority are considered loyal to the Emperor. In internal security operations, the armed forces receive some support from a well-trained commando police of 3,500. The 29,000-man regular police force is engaged primarily in normal police duties and contributes little to counter-insurgency.</p>
                        <p>7. In recent years the Emperor has managed with difficulty to preserve order and retain the allegiance of his multitribal subjects. Yet, his single-handed style of rule has alienated much of the younger generation, and this adds to the growing uncertainties and problems of succession. In the central highlands, the core of the Empire, the major problem is the disaffection of university and secondary students, many of them of the ruling Amhara tribe and the ethnically related Tigreans. Their di icontent is usually expressed as impatience with the slow pace of modernization and development, but also includes dissatisfaction with the amenities provided by government, apprehension over job prospects, tribal jealousies, and vague xenophobic feelings. In recent years, the dimensions of the student problem have grown from sporadic unrest at the university in Addis Ababa to a generalized confrontation which has intermittently paralyzed virtually all secondary and higher education. By and large, <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs tactics of conciliation and compromise, and the dismissal or arrest of student leaders, have temporarily restored order following clashes in December 1969 during which several students were killed. But, student dissidence is virtually certain to crop up again, and, if they are joined by a significant portion of the modern elite in the bureaucracy, police or army, the regime could quickly find itself in serious <pb n="9" xml:id="d287-09" facs="d287-09"/>trouble. The chances are, though, that the various discontented elements at the center would not coalesce, and that future manifestations will be messy but manageable.</p>
                        <p>*For tables on numbers and equipment of the Ethiopian armed forces, see Annex</p>
                        <p>8. There is however, always a possibility of a military seizure of power before the Emperorʼs death. Prolongation of his rule might, and incapacitation of the Emperor would probably, Increase ruspects for such an event. There have already been several attempts on his life; an abortive coup was put down in 1960; and several more recent plots have been uncovered. While there is no present evidence of plotting within the military, discontent is chronic and widespread, particularly among the junior officers.</p>
                        <p>9. The Moslem and animist peoples, who together constitute a majority of the population, dislike the ruling Amharas and feel little allegiance to the Empire. They have failed to gain much materially from incorporation in Ethiopia. In some areas, this dissatisfaction takes the form of sporadic violent actions against tax collectors and other officials of central government; in other regions, deep apathy prevails. In southern Ethiopia, bands of Arussi Gallas with only vague ideological or political aims, but with some support from Somalia, defied the Emperor and fended off a division of the Ethiopian Army for several years before yielding to military pressure and an amnesty offer in early 1970.</p>
                        <p>10. The Ogaden is a special problem. This arid wasteland in the southeast is almost exclusively inhabited by some half million Somali nomads, who have been reasonably quiet in the past couple of years. In the early 1960s, however, there were regular clashes in the Ogaden culminating in a brief border war in 1964. Somalia has never recognized this border, and periodically has armed and trained local Somalis. Conflict in the Ogaden has been reduced by a precarious detente between Somalia and Ethiopia which was the product of the former civilian regime in Mogadiscio, and viewed with skepticism by the Ethiopians. Ethiopian control of the Ogaden is maintained by a substantial military force. It is highly unlikely that Haile Selassie, or any successor, would choose to yield the Ogaden to Somalia no matter what the inducements. Indeed, the Imperial Government may be still considering a scheme of settling army veterans in new villages along the border, in order to reinforce Ethiopian claims to the Ogaden.</p>
                        <p>B. Eritrea</p>
                        <p>11. With an uneasy truce in the Ogaden and the surrender of most Arussi dissidents, Ethiopiaʼs most pressing internal security problem is in Eritrea, the northernmost province and a former Italian colony. The Eritrean population of some 1.6 million is about evenly divided between Coptic Christians, mainly Tigreans, most of whom are indistinguishable physically from fellow tribesmen in neighboring provinces of Ethiopia, and Moslems. It is mainly because of their greater exposure to Western ways and their resentment of Amhara domination, that Eritreans are inlined toward separatism.</p>
                        <p>12. The Eritrean Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>), founded in 1961 by a handful of self-exiled Eritreans, began guerrilla operations against the Imperial Government <pb n="10" xml:id="d287-10" facs="d287-10"/>in the fashion of the traditional bandits of that province. By 1966, it had a free hand in much of the barren lowlands in western and coastal Eritrea. The movement suffered as Arab aid flagged after the Middle East War in 1967, but it re-emerged in early 1969 with more dramatic tactics emphasizing terrorism: raids against road and rail traffic in Eritrea; attacks on power and water installations in Asmara, the Eritrean capital; kidnapping of travelers including some Americans; and sabotage and hijacking of Ethiopian Air Lines planes. After some months of inactivity, they have recently resumed urban terrorism, including assassination of civilian and police officials.</p>
                        <p>13. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> is still small in number, probably less than 2,000 armed guerrillas; its leadership In the field is often inept; and communications between roving guerrilla bands and the exiled leaders are sporadic at best. Nonetheless, it is able to infiltrate small arms and returning trainees by way of Sudan and the Red Sea coast, and can harass Imperial forces in Eritrea. Its forces are sometimes supplemented by those of sympathetic Moslem tribes.</p>
                        <p>14. Clearly, the advantage still lies with the Israel-trained commando police and the Ethiopian Army, whose Second Division, based in Eritrea, makes periodic sweeps through the provinces. The commando police, more efficient than the army, are too few in number (some 3,500) to protect important installations and also pursue the insurgents. And the Second Division, virtually all Amharas, is poorly disciplined and not very effective. Its normal tactics are to burn villages, shoot suspects, and destroy livestock”the traditional Ethiopian response to dissidence.</p>
                        <p>15. Neither the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> nor the Ethiopian Government have tried very hard to win the support of the Eritrean populace. Most Eritreans are resentful of close-fisted Amhara rule, which they feel drains off local resources to benefit the central government and other provinces. Even if the central government were disposed to placate the province, it has few funds for economic development. On the other side, the guerrillas tend to rely more on intimidation and extortion from their fellow Eritreans than on indoctrination or appeals for support and sympathy. Yet, there appears to be a growing realization by Eritreans, Christian as well as Moslem, that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> is likely to remain a feature of the local political scene. At this stage, most Eritrean Christians have no urge to replace Amhara rule with what appears to them as a militant Moslem movement in league with radical foreign Arabs. Moslems in the province view the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> with more interest, but many have divided or conflicting loyalties, and are fearful enough of the Imperial clout to maintain a neutral attitude.</p>
                        <p>16. Despite the fact that <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> terrorist capabilities are rising, Imperial forces seem likely to be able, to contain the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> or keep it on the move. In short, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has virtually no chance of overthrowing Ethiopian authority in Eritrea, nor can Ethiopia stamp out the dissidence. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> will, however, remain a severe domestic irritant.</p>
                        <p>17. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> can look for continuing support from external sources. Syria, its most important backer, permits free movement of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> personnel, makes avail <pb n="11" xml:id="d287-11" facs="d287-11"/>able broadcasting facilities on Radio Damascus, accepts groups of up to 80 recruits at a time for paramilitary training, and also, furnishes a large part of the arms used in Eritrea. Libya gives substantial financial backing. Iraq provides arms, trains <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> officer candidates, and assists <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> propaganda efforts. Both Communist China and Cuba have accepted some <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> recruits for training, and China has shipped some weapons to the guerrillas through intermediaries in South Yemen and Sudan.</p>
                        <p>18. The attitudes and actions of Sudan are particularly important to the success of the insurgency, and a succession of Sudanese governments have vacillated on the matter. Normally the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> moves back and forth across the Sudanese border without much hindrance. The current leftist Sudanese regime would be inclined to give more aid to the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, were it not for the possibility of stepped up Ethiopian aid to rebel blacks in southern Sudan or to conservative factions in the north.</p>
                        <p>19. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has thus far ignored US installations at Kagnew Station. The Kagnew facilities, including the vast antenna fields and the large dish radars are highly vulnerable to sabotage or surprise attack. Installations are scattered over a wide area with villages and public roads interspersed. Large numbers of people in the course of their daily business come into proximity to buildings and equipment on the base. It would not be difficult to lob a few mortar shells into critical parts of Kagnew from outside the guarded base areas. And it would be even simpler for one of the 1,700 local employees to bring explosives into the base, if sabotage were the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> goal.</p>
                        <p>20. There is no evidence of a present threat to Kagnew. Those Americans who have been waylaid or taken captive by the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> (including the Consul-General at Asmara, a party of sergeants from Kagnew, a National Geographic photographer and a Peace Corps volunteer) report little hostility toward the US and no direct threats to Kagnew. The rebels are concerned with publicity for their cause, and assurances of US neutrality in their struggle against the Imperial Government. By and large, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> seems to believe that the Ethiopian Government is a formidable enough foe without also taking on the US. The insurgents are, however, well aware that Washington is providing Ethiopia with economic assistance and arms, and they may assume that the latter is quid pro quo for use of Kagnew.*</p>
                        <p>21. There are however, ominous stirrings which could change the situation abruptly. A recent shakeup in the exile command has brought some hardline activists to the fore but they seem to have little effective control over insurgent bands in Eritrea. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> broadcasts from Damascus are increasingly charged with highly emotional blasts against feudal, Imperialistic, and Zionist foes. Linking the US with their archenemies”Ethiopia and Israel”these pronouncements tend to polarize the issues in the Middle East-Red Sea area and</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d287-12" facs="d287-12"/>
                        <p>*The US has furnished Ethiopia with $230 million In economic assistance since 1948, and $150 million in military aid since 1953.</p>
                        <p>[map of Ethiopia - Asmara: U.S. Communications Facilities] <pb n="13" xml:id="d287-13" facs="d287-13"/>associate the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> with the radical Arabs and Palestinian fedayeen. These broadcasts though chiefly designed to curry favor with the Arab host countries, could sway those <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> insurgents who hear them toward anti-US actions. There is also the danger that in time <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> leaders in the emotionally charged atmosphere of Damascus and Baghdad may come to believe their own propaganda and shift their orders to the field accordingly. Perhaps the most disturbing development, from the US point of view, is the influx of guerrillas returning to Eritrea from training in bitterly anti-US countries who may be tempted to initiate hostile actions against Kagnew or US personnel.</p>
                        <p>22. In sum, despite the obvious deficiencies of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> in manpower, organization, and communications, and their decision thus far not to tangle with the US, we do not discount the possibility of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> taking a more hostile attitude toward the US nor do we rule out the possibility of isolated attacks on US persons or property by ultrazealous individuals or bands. Dramatic developments in the Middle East could affect the situation.</p>
                        <p>C. The Succession</p>
                        <p>23. Disunity within the establishment, however, poses a more direct threat to Ethiopian stability than do the Eritrean insurgency or hostile neighbors. The danger to both Ethiopian stability and to US interests will, therefore, become most acute when <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> leaves the scene. Despite the historic tradition of challenging each Imperial successor, there are persuasive reasons for estimating a smooth transfer of power: the Constitutional designation of Crown Prince Asia Wossen as heir to the throne; the establishment of a national army In place of feudal levies; the growth of a national treasury and a centralized bureaucracy; the power of the Church; and some sense of Ethiopian nationalism among the Amharas and some Tigreans and Callas. Weighed against this are the fragility of some institutions and the absence of others, tribal Jealousies and personal ambitions, and the long pent-up feelings of all those who have been restive under the Emperorʼs autocratic rule. To some extent Haile Selassie, by employing a highly personal style of rule, has fostered the very things that threaten a smooth succession.</p>
                        <p>24. Despite the foregoing, it is generally assumed that the Crown Prince, now 54 years old, will succeed to the throne. But he will almost certainly not wield his fatherʼs vast personal power, nor does he seem disposed to try. Unless he is supported by both traditional and modernizing forces, other contenders would probably make a bid fur the throne. A few powerful Amharic and Tigrean nobles boast of claims to the Solomon-Sheba line of succession which are at least as good as the Crown Princeʼs.</p>
                        <p>25. Much would depend upon the cohesion of the armed forces which might assume an expanded role. Currently the army is held together mainly by respect for and fear of the Emperor, and by personal allegiances based on family, clan or marriage. Considerable rivalries have already been generated within the officer corps by the Emperorʼs practice of playing off military leaders against each <pb n="14" xml:id="d287-14" facs="d287-14"/>other. The possibility of factional feuding among the top officers, and among the powerful nobility outside of the armed forces, is very strong. Should the army unite in support of the Crown Prince (or another candidate) then the transition to a new regime could be fairly smooth.</p>
                        <p>26. Whatever form the successor government takes, it will face a monumental task in holding together the displrate peoples of the Empire. If succession becomes such a contentious issue that troops and leaders flock to the central region, the Empire would probably lose control over some outlying areas, and might even find its integrity threatened. The death of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> is the moment for watch all dissidents within the Empire are waiting. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> would make some bold moves toward “liberating” Eritrea. They would not have much chance of success unless substantial Ethiopian Army and police units were removed from the province, or they dissolve in confusion. Somalis in the Ogaden would almost certainly attempt to join the Somali Republic, if Ethiopian military force in that area were greatly weakened. Some among the Gallas, the largest ethnic group in the country, would demand a greater share in the central government, and if denied might engage in some dissidence. While an interval of lawlessness and uncertainty would be likely in such circumstances, there is a better than even chance that a central government would reassert authority.</p>
                        <p>27. There is a good chance that a successor government will take a more belligerent stance in dealing with internal foes and with neighboring states. Relations with Sudan and Somalia are likely to be more abrasive, and the chances of border clashes or of attempts by neighbors to foster dissidence in Ethiopia would be greater. Ethiopiaʼs friendly relations with Kenya would not be affected by the succession, nor would Kenya take any part in an internal Ethiopian struggle. Any successor regime in Addis Ababa would lack much of the confidence and assurance which <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> possesses. But even if the “modernizers” were to gain predominance, the basic outlook of Ethiopia would almost certainly remain much as it has been under the Emperor, i.e., the dominant group in the country would still see itself as defending a Christian bastion against Moslems whose support from the Communist powers could only be balanced by aid for Ethiopia from the West. Until the regime stabilizes, Ethiopiaʼs leading role in African affairs.”in large part the result of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs personal initiative”is likely to decline.</p>
                        <p>III. SOMALIA</p>
                        <p>28. Somalia has the advantage unique in Africa of ethnic and religious homogeneity, but few other assets. It is much smaller and poorer than Ethiopia. A large portion of its nearly 3 million inhabitants”another 850,000 Somalis reside in Ethiopia and Kenya”are nomads, and only a few are settled farmers. Others are semiemployed urban dwellers. Many of the Somali nomads roam freely across borders in seasonal migrations to watering places in Kenya, Ethiopia, and the French Territory of the Afars and Issas. The relatively democratic system of government which prevailed since independence in 1960 was shaken by <pb n="15" xml:id="d287-15" facs="d287-15"/>election frauds and corruption prior to being swept away last fall by a military coup. Currently a cumbersome 24-man group of army and police officers, calling itself the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), is attempting to rule the country. Its leading figure, General SIAD, is an opportunist whose political skills are now being tested. Since the coup he has gradually assumed greater authority in the council, though his views may not always prevail.</p>
                        <p>29. Given the awkwardness of government by revolutionary council, the limited abilities and experience of its youthful members, and the intractable national problems, it is hardly surprising that the regime has provided little sense of direction. It is still uncertain of what to do with its civilian predecessors, now held in detention. It is also aware that some important clans believe them-selves inadequately represented in government, and are likely to make their discontent more evident in some fashion. Moreover, the SRC faces severe economic problems, brought on by drought, a recession in the small modern sector, and diminished government rivenues. Even in better times, Somalia depended heavily upon outside assistance, of which an annual Italian donation to meet budgetary expenses was most important. The Italian subsidy continues, but other foreign aid has fallen off. The multiplicity of economic and social problems faced by the SRC and tribal, generational, and ideological tensions within the government suggest further instability and change.</p>
                        <p>30. The SRC, like its counterparts in Libya and Sudan which also came on the scene in 1969, is fiercely nationalistic, with some leanings toward Islamic puritanism. The regime is also much more susceptible than its predecessor to radical Arab blandishments. Somalis do not normally consider themselves part of the Arab world, but Islamic ties are stronger than ever and of more interest to the SRC than relations with black Africa. Perhaps also, some of the Somali overtures to the Arabs are motivated by hopes of getting money from an oil-rich Arab state.</p>
                        <p>31. Unlike the previous regime, which was officially non-aligned but with a tilt to the West, the SRC has taken several actions aggravating relations with the US Including the expulsion of the Peace Corps In December 1989, the expulsion of five embassy officials in May 1970, and the nationalization of some foreign businesses also in May. Some SRC members evidently believe that the US is plotting to do them in. In part this stems from the close relations between the US and former Prime Minister Eo2Z now under arrest. It also derives from the US role as arms supplier to the archenemy, Ethiopia, and is probably encouraged by Soviet advisors in Mogadiscio. Yet, although some SRC members urge a break in relations with the US; others are hopeful of retaining US economic aid, as well as an image of non-alignment.* At the moment a modest US presence is tolerated, but this may change for the worse.</p>
                        <p>*The US since 1954 has extended approximately $72 million in economic aid to Somalia, and Is setting aside some $1.9 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="d287-16" facs="d287-16"/>
                        <p>32. The position of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in Somalia is quite different. Although the Russians have furnished $63 million in economic aid, and $35 million in military aid, it is the latter which affords them easy entree into the offices of the SRC. Soviet involvement with the Somali Army began in 1963. The Somali Government, at that time facing a relatively well-armed Ethiopia in a bitter dispute over the Ogaden, made a futile attempt to get arms and training from a number of countries, East and West. The Soviets made an offer, perhaps to forestall a Chinese bid. Since then, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has provided virtually all weapons and training for the Somali Army. Many of the officers on the SRC have been trained in Soviet military academies, but not all are considered pro-Soviet.</p>
                        <p>33. Somali foreign policy pronouncements are a curious mixture of strident assertions of independence, denunciation of neocolonialism, and praise for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The SRC extended diplomatic recognition to East Germany (among the first black African states to do so), made port facilities available to Soviet naval vessels, and outdid itself in celebrating the Lenin Centenary. Much of this is dearly designed to induce the Soviets to provide more aid. Shortly after the coup a Soviet delegation toured Somalia. It saw the dismal results of past economic aid”faltering state farms, under-utilized factories, and a fish processing facility which has not yet proved to be of value. There is still no announcement of new aid, economic or military, from Moscow, though the Somali needs are daily becoming more pressing. The Soviets are undoubtedly reluctant to assume the burdens of keeping afloat such an unpromising state. They may also be unsure of the staying power of the present regime, and wary of overly close identification with a possible early loser.</p>
                        <p>34. Thus far the SRC has not defined its position on the Greater Somalia issue, either because it is too unsure of its own stability, or because it is divided on the matter. The previous governmentʼs detente policy was not popular with a good many Somalis, including most of the military. But not all of those who reject detente are keen on instigating insurgencies in Somali inhabited lands across the borders. The various attempts to stir up trouble in these lands in the past have not helped the Greater Somali cause, and have left a heritage of tensions and distrust. We believe that the SRC, if it can hold power over the next year or two, will make some gestures in the direction of irredentism, such as a resumption of propaganda aiming at the unity of all Somalis or a clandestine training program for cross-border insurgents. It is doubtful, however, that the SRC would promote active insurgency in these areas unless more favorable conditions came about. Such favorable circumstances would include the withdrawal of France from the TFAI, and the deaths of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> of Kenya, should these events lead to civil conflict.</p>
                        <p>35. Essentially, the Greater Somalia concept runs counter to the general African dictum on inviolability of borders. Somali claims to territory of their neighbors are simply incompatible with the national policies of Kenya and Ethiopia. If Somalia resumes efforts to gain control of these lands, whether directly or through now dormant “liberation fronts,” hostilities with the neighboring lands would ensue. If Somali armed forces were not so obviously inferior to those of Ethiopia, <pb n="17" xml:id="d287-17" facs="d287-17"/>or of Kenya in league with Ethiopia, the danger in the Horn would be much greater. Distances, poor roads, and inadequate logistic capabilities of all armies in the area also weigh heavily as factors inhibiting open war. Yet, the tensions persist, Somalis are not likely soon to give up their Irredentist dreams, and opportunities across the frontiers in Kenya and Ethiopia may tempt the Somalis into an adventure.</p>
                        <p>IV. THE FRENCH TERRITORY OF THE AFARS AND ISSAS</p>
                        <p>36. A critical area of potential strife is the French Territory of the Afars and Issas (TFAI), formerly known as French Somaliland. Ethnic Somalis (Issas) are in the majority in the port-rail city of Djibouti, and perhaps in the territory as a whole. Yet the French prefer to rule through a local assembly dominated by Afars (a nomadic tribe with its main base in Ethiopia). Continued French rule is costly to Paris, especially since the closure of the Suez Canal, and the French appear to have little interest in retaining the territory naide from the convenience of the port and airfield as links to territories to the east and south. They stay on because there is little anti-colonialist pressure even from radical Africans, and because they believe they would be held responsible for the mess after their departure. Both Somalia and Ethiopia are irreconcilably opposed to the other gaining control over the territory. Djibouti is important to Ethiopia as the terminus of the only rail link from Addis Ababa to the sea. The Somalis have long claimed the territory because they believe its population to be predominantly Somali.</p>
                        <p>37. The TFAI domestic scene is fairly tranquil. Afars and Issas do not like or trust each other, but French security forces, some 3,800 troops, are sufficient to maintain order. Only sporadic terrorist incidents have occurred since the violence which marred De Gaulleʼs visit to Djibouti in 1966 and the subsequent referendum. Indeed, Somalia is trying to improve relations with the French in order to encourage a plebiscite in which ethnic Somalis would stand a good chance of gaining control.</p>
                        <p>38. The French would probably withdraw if they thought there was a good chance of finding a political solution agreeable to Ethiopia and Somalia. They might also leave if it became clear that the populace wanted then out. Other-wise we expect the French to remain for some time. There is no obvious solution to the TFAI problem. An independent TFAI would probably quickly become the scene of a struggle between Somalis and Ethiopians. If France turned the territory over to an international control group, it would merely perpetuate or postpone the resolution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>V. ISRAELI AND ARAB INTERESTS</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="d287-18" facs="d287-18"/>
                        <p>39. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>40. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>41. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>42. Ethiopian fears of Moslem encirclement have been compounded in the past year by the appearance of radical military regimes in Khartoum and Mogadiscio. In both cases, Soviet and radical Arab influence has increased substantially. Sudan, furthermore, has signed agreements providing for military and economic cooperation with Libya and the UAR. A Somali delegation has also visited each of these countries and probably made further overtures for a military pact with cudan. Military cooperation between twc inept armies, widely separated and both preoccupied with internal problems, would, however, have little material effect on the situation in the Horn. More importantly, Somali and Sudanese ties with the radical Arab states are likely further to arouse Ethiopian suspicions.</p>
                        <p>43. Pan-African Ideals which in the past decade have had some softening effect on tensions between Arab and black Africans have declined. For some years, only Syria and Iraq openly supported the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. Though Algeria, the UAR, <pb n="19" xml:id="d287-19" facs="d287-19"/>and Libya often passed funds to the Eritrean rebels, they did so clandestinely. The concept of African unity was a deterrent to an open acknowledgement of support, particularly in the case of such a prestigious leader as Haile Selassie. But, at the last summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity, the hackers of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> openly boasted of their assistance. At the same time, Somalia and the African Arabs (minus Tunisia) further infuriated the Ethiopians by refusing to support a resolution against hijacking of airplanes.</p>
                        <p>44. The general deterioration of relations between Ethiopia and the Moslem states in the area reflects the heightened tensions of the Arab-Israeli struggle. Chronic suspicions and misunderstandings are intensified by rumors on both sides, and by the shrill pitch of radical Arab rhetoric pouring forth from radio and newspapers. The high level of Middle East tensions reduce prospects of improved relations in the Horn. The outlook is for more tensions, and further polarization of the peoples and states of the Horn.</p>
                        <p>VI. SOVIET INTERESTS</p>
                        <p>45. Soviet strategic interests in the Horn of Africa are associated with but clearly subordinate to their involvement in the Middle East and Mediterranean. Soviet activities in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean contribute to their interest in the Horn. This is further enhanced by the fact that, since the closing of the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Aden provides the only access to the Red Sea. Visits to ports in Somalia, Sudan, and South Yemen are becoming more frequent and servo to remind the local regimes of Soviet interest in their lands and to demonstrate Soviet power. Another, and perhaps more important, instrument of Soviet policy is the provision of military aid to Somalia and Sudan. In the case of Somalia, it is this type of aid which has afforded the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a strong measure of influence with the military rulers.</p>
                        <p>46. A primary Soviet objective in the Horn, as in much of the Third World, is to deny the area to the West, but it is difficult to discern much beyond that. Soviet opportunities in Somalia and Sudan are more promising at the moment, but the Russians have not neglected Addis Ababa. Undoubtedly, they would like to have the US base at Kagnew removed. But they have apparently given no direct aid to the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, nor do they issue threats to Ethiopia. Rather, they are endeavoring to retain the good will of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>, even though they are arming his enemies. When the Emperor complains to Moscow of its arms shipments and training of Somalis, he is told that he, too, can receive Russian arms if he wishes. Probably a condition would be to reduce the American presence. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, meanwhile, is biding its time, offering further economic aid from the credit line of $100 million”extended to Ethiopia in 1959 but only scantily drawn upon. The Soviets seem to be counting on opportunities to gain influence or oust the US after <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs death. It is unlikely that they will succeed in doing so.</p>
                        <p>47. Soviet aid to Somalia and Sudan has not cost a great deal either in money, personnel, or damaged relations with Ethiopia. Nor have they done much over <pb n="20" xml:id="d287-20" facs="d287-20"/>the years to take advantage of their strong position in Somalia. Western scientists have speculated that Somalia would be a useful site for major Soviet space tracking or monitoring installations. Apparently the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not presently interested in using its influence in Somalia in this way. Thus far, it has managed to reduce Western Influences in Sudan and Somalia, and that is probably sufficient satisfaction to Moscow at this time. Perhaps at some point the Soviets would find it useful to seek naval, air, or sophisticated space tracking facilities in these countries. At the moment they have the use of Aden as a port of call, which is better equipped than the ports of Somalia and Sudan. The Soviets rely mainly on their own lines of supply for support and apparently make port visits mainly for political reasons. Soviet combat ships have visited Somalia more than any other country in the area.</p>
                        <p>VII. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES</p>
                        <p>48. The great uncertainty in the Horn is the aftermath of the Emperorʼs death. We think that a successor government would continue to look to the US as its primary backer, if only because the Soviets are deeply involved with the enemies of the Empire. If a successor regime faces some difficulty from internal or external challenges, as seems likely, it would look to the US for additional, emergency support including arms and petroleum, and would probably make subsequent judgments on the continuation of US use of Kagnew largely on the basis of the American response.</p>
                        <p>49. The US lease on Kagnew Station runs through 1978. In a day when military bases of the Great Powers in African countries are generally unwelcome, there is virtually no clamor in Ethiopia against the installation. It is a communications and scientific research base and is publicized as such”with some effect, apparently”in the area. In Eritrea, its contribution to the economy has a significant influence on its acceptability. Propaganda blasts from Communist, Arab, and <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> media will certainly continue to hammer at the foreign base theme, particularly after the US withdrawal from Wheelus base in Libya. But this is likely to have little effect on <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>. Nor do we think that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> is now considering hostile activity against Kagnew, but there is a danger that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> command will slide into anti-Americanism, and order hostile actions against Kagnew.</p>
                        <p>50. In the chronically tense atmosphere of the Horn, there is always a strong risk of a minor incident escalating into a larger conflict. The US no longer has much influence in Somalia or Sudan, but does have a potential capability for restraining Ethiopian military action. So far as we can determine, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not encouraging Somalia and Sudan towards more bellicose positions. Indeed, it would be awkward for both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, if a conflict broke out between Somalia and Ethiopia. The Ethiopians would look to Washington for moral and materiel support, and the US would face some difficult policy decisions.</p>
                        <pb n="21" xml:id="d287-21" facs="d287-21"/>
                        <p>51. Although the US need for Kagnew is a factor in our present interests in the Horn, there is the broader question of the US position in Ethiopia. There are few US investments there, though the potential for development is considered promising. Access to Ethiopian airfields and ports is potentially of great value to the US. In a broader sense, a stable Ethiopia is a kind of linchpin for conservative forces in the area, e.g., Kenya, and Saudi Arabia. Also a strong US presence in a major African country probably helps encourage moderate, pro-Western views in Africa as a whole.</p>

                        <p>1. SUMMARY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED REFTELS, AND LATER MESSAGES, I CALLED TODAY ON GENERAL SIAD, PRESIDENT SRC, TO INFORM HIM OF THE TERMINATION US BILATERAL ASSISTANCE TO SOMALIA AS OF JUNE 1, 1970. PROCEDURES FOR AN ORDERLY PHASE-OUT WERE OUT- LINED, AND SIAD AGREED WITH THEM IN PRINCIPLE. HIS RESPONSE WAS SOBER. OVERTONES OF HIS REMARKS RAISE LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL STRAIN IN US-SOMALI RELATIONS AS RESULT THIS ACTION. END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>2. AFTER REVIEWING EFFORTS OF MANY MONTHS TO FIND MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION TO SOMALI FLAG SHIPPING PROBLEM, AND STRESSING MANDATORY NATURE OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION RE SHIPPING GOING TO NORTH VIETNAM (AND CUBA) I INFORMED GENERAL SIAD THAT US WOULD HAVE TO TERMINATE BILATERAL AID JUNE 1. I DEFINED ASSISTANCE WHICH WOULD BE TERMINATED, E.G. EDUCATION, AGRICULTURE, PUBLIC SAFETY AND SELF-HELP, AND POINTED OUT THAT FUTURE BILATERAL ASSIS <pb n="2" xml:id="d288-02" facs="d288-02"/>TANCE, INCLUDING PL 480, WOULD ALSO BE PRECLUDED. I ALSO DEFINED ASSISTANCE ON WHICH COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THUS NOT EFFECTED, E.G. COMPLETION CHISIMAIO REPAIRS, PRESENT MOGADISCIO WATER LOAN, PRESENT SDB LOAN, PROJECTS CLEARLY REGIONAL, AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS IBRD._AND UNDP. I NEXT EX PLAINED SECTION 617 OF FAA. I PROPOSED USAID DIRECTOR AND I INITIATE DISCUSSION WITH APPROPRIATE SECRETARIES OF MINISTRIES CONCERNED, WITH VIEW TO WORKING OUT ORDERLY PROCEDURE FOR PHASE-OUT OF AID. FINALLY, I REEMPHASIZED WORLD-WIDE NATURE OF REQUIREMENT, FACT THAT CESSATION OF AID NOT DIRECTED SOLELY AT SOMALIA, AND THAT ACTION DID NOT REPRESENT CHANGE IN DESIRE OF USG FOR FRIENDLY AND MUTUALLY RESPECTED RELATIONS WITH SOMALIA.</p>
                        <p>3. GENERAL SIAD RECEIVED ABOVE INFORMATION WITH GREAT SERIOUSNESS AND IN HIS REPLY MADE THREE PRINCIPAL POINTS. HE RENEWED HIS PERSONAL ASSURANCES OF RESPECT TOWARD ME HIS APPRECIATION OF MY DESIRE TO BE HELPFUL TO THE SOMALI PEOPLE. HE THEN EXPRESSED DISMAY (DESPITE MY EMPHASIS ON MANDATORY NATURE OF LEGISLATION THAT PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A WAY OF PREVENTING THIS ACTION, WHICH WOULD HARM THE SOMALI PEOPLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIGHT POVERTY, FINALLY, WITH SADNESS AND CONCERN, HE SAID, “YOU AND I HAVE LOST. THESE PERSONS SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS OPPOSED TO SOMALIA AND THAT THE U.S. WISHES TO PREVENT SOMALIAʼS GROWTH WILL SAY THEY ARE RIGHT.” HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THIS ACTION WOULD NOT DAMAGE TOO SERIOUSLY THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d288-03" facs="d288-03"/>
                        <p>4. GENERAL SIAD AGREED WITH MY PROPOSED PROCEDURE FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH SECRETARIES ON PHASE-OUT, ADDING THAT MATTER, OF COURSE, WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED BY SUPREME REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. HE CONCLUDED CONVERSATION BY AGREEING WITH ME THAT OUR TASK AHEAD WAS TO WORK OUT A METHOD WHEREBY THE TERMIINATION OF AID WOULD HAVE AS LITTLE HARMFUL EFFECT ON PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION, SIAD REFERRED TO EFFORTS OF WARSAMA, SECRETARY OF COMMUNICATIONS, TO FIND SOLUTION VIA SODERI IN PARIS.(WARSAMA HAS NOT HEARD FROM PARIS YET) I NOTED THAT IF EFFECTIVE ACTION TO STOP TRADE WERE TAKEN, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE RECONSIDER DECTSION, BUT GAVE HIM NOHOPE THIS WOULD, IN FACT, BE LIKELY.</p>
                        <p>5. COMMENT: ANY TIME IS A POOR TIME CARRY OUT INSTRUCTION TO CUT OFF ASSISTANCE TO A COUNTRY AS DESPERATELY POOR AND INTENSELY SENSITIVE AS SOMALIA. BUT ACTION AT THIS TIME COULD HARDLY BE BETTER CALCULATED TO STRENGTHEN SUSPICION OF THE UNITED STATES, ACCELERATE GREATER DEPENDENCE ON COMMUNIST ASSISTANCE, AND ADD TO THE SIZEABLE PROBLEMS FACING AMERICAN PRIVATE FIRMS IN SOMALIA. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS (AND SIAD APPEARED AGREE MY PROPOSAL OF NO LOCAL PUBLICITY), THE WIDELY SPREAD RUMORS <pb n="4" xml:id="d288-04" facs="d288-04"/>THAT THE U.S. IS PULLING OUT WILL APPEAR CONFIRMED. THE FIFTEEN-MAN EAST GERMAN DELEGATION HERE TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RECEIVE EVEN MORE URGENT REQUESTS. WESTERN NUCLEAR WILL MOST LIKELY FEEL REPERCUSSIONS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXACT EFFECT ON OUR OWN RELATIONS WITH SOMALIA, NONE OF US EXPECTS THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO SEE THE RECENT TREND OF INCREASING STRAIN AND HARASSMENT.</p>

                            <item>Somali Seizure of American Freighter, “The Midnight Sun”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>On June 25 a Somali naval vessel seized and forced into a Somali port an American freighter, allegedly for violating Somali territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The vessel is “The Midnight Sun”. She is small (180 gross tons)-- and has aboard eight people (five Americans and three Singaporian crew members). The vessel is American-owned and registered and is chartered to Geophysical Services Inc, of Dallas Texas, a subsidiary of Texas Instruments. Geophysical Services is a legitimate and well-known oil exploration company. As of now, there is no reason to suspect hanky-panky but I have asked State to check this out carefully. The vessel has $200, 000 of “very technical seismic recording equipment” aboard -- and this could arouse Somali suspicions.</p>
                        <p>According to a message received by the company from the captain of the vessel, the vessel was 10 to 20 miles off the Somali coast at the time of seizure. (The Somalis claim jurisdiction of 12 miles.) “The Midnight Sun” was ordered to stop, did not, the Somali naval vessel fired a shot across the bow, “The Midnight Sun” stopped, and was then ordered into the port of Chisimaio (pronounced KISS-a-MY-oh). Chisimaio is located some 250 miles south of Mogadiscio and near the Kenya border. It is a town of some 50 to 60 thousand people.</p>
                        <p>State Department first heard of the seizure through a call from Texas Congressman J. J. Pickleʼs office on the afternoon of June 25. Pickle had been approached by the company as a result of a message from the ship sent prior to the vesselʼs arrival at Chisimaio. The shipʼs radio has been silent since arrival in the port.</p>
                        <p>State is in touch with the company and has, of course, put our Embassy in Mogadiscio to work. The problem is complicated by the fact that today is a Muslim holiday, and all the Somali government offices are closed.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d291-02" facs="d291-02"/>
                        <p>Thus far, our Embassy has been able only to confirm that the vessel is in Chisimaio.</p>
                        <p>We have a number of resources.. There is, apparently, a local agent in Mogadiscio of Geophysical Services Inc. We also have an Army Engineer detachment of 3 people working on the port in Chisimaio. Finally, we have 3 AID civilians stationed in Chisimaio. Our Embassy has the pedal down trying to get in contact with all these people in addition to relevant Somali government officials. We should be hearing soon.</p>
                        <p>We recently terminated our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program to Somalia. An anti-American press campaign resulted and could be a factor in this situation. However, as of now, we have no reason to think the seizure was anything more than a fluke -- and no reason to think that the release of the vessel and the crew cannot be amicably arranged once our Embassy has cornered the appropriate Somali officials. So far the press is not aware of the seizure, and Chisimaio is an extremely remote place. I have asked State to suggest to the company that all publicity be avoided for the moment in the hopes that we can keep Somali nationalist pride from becoming a factor in the situation.</p>
                        <p>We are on top of it here, and I do not think anything is required of you until the situation becomes clearer. I suggest, however, that you let the President know of this cloud upon the horizon and recommend that you sign the attached memorandum to the President.</p>

                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d292-02" facs="d292-02"/>
                        <p>4. AS FOR CHARGES THEY ARE THE FOLLOWING, HE SAID:</p>
                        <p>A. VESSEL HAD ENTERED SOMALI WATERS WITHOUT PERMISSION,</p>
                        <p>B. CONTRARY TO INTERNATIONAL LAW VESSEL DISPLAYED NO NATIONAL FLAG. AND</p>

While there was as yet no publicity and Somali officials had not yet officially charged the ship with violations, U.S. officials had still not determined what would be necessary to gain the release of the vessel and its crew. Most worrisome was the fact that to Somalis it must appear there was good reason to believe they had intercepted an American spy ship.</note>

                            <item>Somali Seizure of the Midnight Sun: “Progress” Report</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Thus far, this situation has neither deteriorated, nor improved.</p>
                        <p>On the good side:</p>
                        <p>--There has been no publicity, either on our side or on that of the Somalis.<lb/>-- The Somali authorities have not yet officially charged the vessel even with navigational violations, much less with espionage.<lb/>-- The Somalis have, finally, approved access to the five detained Americans by one of our consular officers. He will be travelling from Mogadiscio to Chisimaio on July 4.<lb/>-- The atmosphere in Chisimaio is calm and friendly, with the Americans stationed there included in the official Independence Day celebrations on July 1.<lb/>-- General SIADʼs Independence Day message was totally bereft of any anti-American tone, which is notable in itself and may indicate that the Somalis are not contemplating making a big deal out of the Midnight Sun.<lb/>-- The five detained Americans are apparently being kept in a hotel and are being well treated.</p>
                        <p>On the bad side:</p>
                        <p>-- The Somalis have cancelled a visit to Chisimaio scheduled to begin on July 3 by a U.S. destroyer.<lb/>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d293-02" facs="d293-02"/>-- It has now been a full week since the Midnight Sun was seized and we have not yet been able to come to grips with Somali authorities on what will be necessary to affect the release of the vessel and its detained crew<lb/>-- We have good indications that the Somalis do not believe that the seismic research equipment aboard the Midnight Sun is truly seismic research equipment.</p>
                        <p>The most worrisome part of this matter is the way it must appear to a Somali, even a fair-minded one. From their point of view, this is what happened:</p>
                        <p>-- An unauthorized vessel penetrated their territorial waters.<lb/>-- It refused to respond to a query from a coastal observation post.<lb/>-- After a long chase it was overtaken by a Somali patrol boat.<lb/>-- It was flying no flag.<lb/>-- It refused the patrol boatʼs order to heave to until fired upon.<lb/>-- It then ran up an American flag and on investigation was found to be full of very sophisticated electronics equipment. Obviously, from the Somali point of view, the strong suspicion arises that they have intercepted an American “spyship”.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the ship is clean as a houndʼs tooth. (I have had Peter Jessup check this out carefully.) We are playing it cool, lest excessive interest on our part serve to confirm Somali suspicions of U. S. Government involvement. State wanted to take the initiative in canceling the naval visit but I dissuaded them from this for which they are now quite glad. We have afoot a scheme by which the owner of the vessel will bespeak the help of an international oceanographic research outfit in persuading the Somali authorities of the bona fides of the Midnight Sun. The worst part of the situation that has obtained for the last week, our inability to have access to the crew members, has now been removed. We are still getting full cooperation from the owner and the charterer. All things considered, I think we are on the best course in letting the Somalis take their time in establishing what is, in fact, the truth. It is, however, by no means clear yet that this approach will work -- and it is still a distinct possibility that we may get a “spyship” incident out of all this yet.</p>

                        <p>1. Department of Navy plan for consolidating the communications functions at Kagnew Station complex in order to reduce U.S. presence and land requirements is currently being reviewed. Plan, if implemented, will reduce required manpower by 175 spaces (135 of which are military) and 1,315 acres of land (tracts “D”, “G” and part of “F”) with one-time costs of $4,930,250 which would be amortized in less than five years through savings in military pay and annual operating costs. Implementation is not contemplated until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72-73 time frame because of lack of funds. Completion of the consolidation would be about two and a half or three years after initiation.</p>
                        <p>2. Plan will be presented shortly to SecDef for approval.<lb/>END</p>

                        <p>The Evans Novak column in the Washington Post this morning has full details on this matter. The period of no publicity is therefore over and, given the nature of the case, we can expect considerable press interest.</p>
                        <p>The Evans Novak column attributes the seizure of the Midnight Sun and keys the whole story to “steadily rising Russian influence” in Somalia and East Africa.</p>
                        <p>Except for the fact that life is unfair, we would have won the race to get the vessel released before its seizure became a matter of public knowledge. The Somali Ambassador in Washington has been under instructions for 5 days to deliver a note from General SIAD to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> informing us that the vessel and crew will be released. The note still cannot be delivered however, because the Somalis cannot decode the message, even after several retransmissions. (They have new coding machines -- doubtless provided by the Russians -- and just cannot make them work properly.)</p>
                        <p>I am sorely tempted to nip this story in the bud announcing what we know of the Somali decision. However, on balance, I do not think that prudent because we have indications, both from the Somali Embassy and from Italian sources, that the garbled part of the message may, repeat may, involve some kind of condition which we might find troublesome.</p>
                        <p>We cannot, therefore, announce at this point that the matter has been resolved. Hopefully, we will be able to do so quite soon.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, I think the White House Press Office should leave this one strictly alone and simply refer all questions to the State Department. We will get our innings when we are able to announce the letter to President Nixon and the decision to release the vessel and crew.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">1. Horn of Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As I mentioned to you, Roger and I discussed many months ago the need for a study of problems in the Horn of Africa. The recent Evans-Novak article on Midnight Sun/Somalia, with its dire predictions for Kagnew, put a fresh focus on this problem area.</p>
                        <p>Attached are a long outdated draft of a memorandum and a proposed NSSM on the subject which might be useful for your thinking.</p>
                        <p>-- When HAK was last approached on this subject, he shied away. He was thinking in terms of contingency plans rather than a policy paper.</p>
                        <p>-- It seems to me that we do need a general policy look at this area -- it consumes the lionʼs share of our military and economic aid on the continent and embraces our single most important facility. Moreover, a basic policy look would provide a better framework for contingency plans.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, two contingencies at least worth noting: (1) a major upheaval in Ethiopia resulting either from the demise of <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> or out-of-control Eritrean dissidence threatening Kagnew, and (2) a border “war” involving any two or more of Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and the French territories. There is room for mischief making and signs of it from the Arabs, Israelis and the Soviets. These contingency studies might be done as a <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>/IG project which could later be forwarded for consideration by the WSAG (they could be undertaken at Dave Newsomʼs instigation).</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">2. Southern Africa</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As we noted in reviewing the Presidentʼs decisions on Southern Africa, there are three major issues not yet reduced to decision memoranda:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d297-02" facs="d297-02"/>
                        <p>(1) EXIM policy, (2) aid to the black states, and (3) general posture. The President made decisions but for bureaucratic reasons they were not included in the NSDM issued after the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>-- It might be time now to clarify the EXIM policy as to South Africa -- the NSDM on Southwest Africa dealt with EXIM policy there.</p>
                        <p>-- The Presidentʼs foreign policy statement indicated a desire to increase our aid to the black states. Something more definitive probably should be stated.</p>
                        <p>-- As to general posture, it seems to me we need not do anything about stating it -- it, after all, is the sum total of the effect of all the other decisions that have been made. The Presidentʼs foreign policy statement and the Secretaryʼs statement on Africa probably says all that needs to be said on this subject.</p>
                        <p>3. The foregoing are just some thoughts that occurred to me as possibly of some help. If you are inclined to move on any of them, I would try to be helpful in any way you wish.</p>

                        <p>Recent events have pointed up several potential trouble spots in East Africa:</p>
                        <p>-- Ethiopiaʼs internal situation is shaky with pressures for modernization and separatist guerrillas straining the traditionalist regime of the aging Emperor.<lb/>-- Somalia is unsettled in the wake of a recent coup, which ousted pro-Western Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> in favor of left-leaning officers who are warm to the Soviets and cool to us. This new regime may mean a revival of the Somali-Ethiopian border dispute which has threatened war several times in the last decade.<lb/>-- In Kenya, tribal rivalry in the aftermath of Mboyaʼs murder could explode, particularly when the aging Jomo Kenyatta dies. Kenya also has its own potential border problems with Somalia and Ethiopia.<lb/>-- The Sudan is caught up in the Arab-Israeli problem while it continues to (a) fight a 10-year old civil war against a black minority in the South and (b) aid the guerrillas fighting in northeastern Ethiopia. (The Soviets are arming Sudan. Both Moscow and Peking are giving military aid to Somalia. )</p>
                        <p>Our interests and influence in the area are limited. But we have a sizeable investment of economic and military aid in Ethiopia, and enjoy a major <pb n="4" xml:id="d297-04" facs="d297-04"/>communications facility at Kagnew Station in the troubled northeastern province of the country. Also, there are growing U.S. private investments in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>The Somali and Sudanese coups, as well as the mortality of the Emperor, may pose some thorny choices about keeping our hand in the region. We should clarify our long-run priorities in the various countries to be ready for any contingency.</p>

                        <p>The President has directed a review of the specific issues and general policy choices facing the United States in the Horn of Africa -- concentrating on Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, but also covering adjacent countries to the extent that they relate to the problems of the region.</p>
                        <p>The study should assess U.S. interests and ʼevaluate our programs in the area. It should also analyze internal dissidence in each country, relations among the countries of the area, and the influences on the region of other powers -- as these factors bear on U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>The study should address in particular the problems and prospects of political succession in Kenya and Ethiopia. It should consider as precisely as possible alternative contingency plans for responding to the conceivable changes in leadership in those countries including the eventuality of civil war.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have considered the recommendations in your memorandum of 19 March 1970, subject as above, that consolidation of DCS facilities at Kagnew Station be deferred indefinitely with Service assignments remaining unchanged and, alternatively, that if the decision is made to proceed with consolidation, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) responsibility be assigned to the Army vice the Navy.</p>
                        <p>After re-examination of the various facets of our operations in Ethiopia, I still consider it inadvisable, both politically and economically, to attempt to retain the status quo at Kagnew Station.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate your concern over the phase-out of the Army Strategic Communications Command Facility at Kagnew that will result from implementation of the proposed consolidation plan forwarded by the Navy in response to the specific guidance provided in my memorandum of 17 July 1969. However, I do not consider the rationale included in support of your recommendations contains sufficient justification to warrant a change in my decision to effect consolidation at Kagnew based on single Service communications O&amp;M with responsibility as-signed to the Navy. Analysis of your supporting material discloses no pertinent information that had not previously been carefully considered.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I have directed the Director, Defense Communications Agency, in coordination with the Services, to prepare a Management Engineering Plan for communications consolidation based on the Navy plan referred to above.</p>

                        <p>The high point, or the low point, depending on your point of view, of this episode was the attempt of the head Somali, General SIAD, to send you a personal message announcing the decision to release the Midnight Sun. The Somali Embassy here was never able to deliver the message because they could never get their Russian-provided coding machines to function properly.</p>

Also mention we anticipate further reductions in next year or so as additional technical advances introduced which will likely include relinquishment certain land areas.</p>
                        <p>4. Suggest Yost also inform Brumit EAL of reduction to cut off one source speculation and permit him adjust, if necessary, services accordingly.</p>
                        <p>5. Anticipate Asrate, and possibly Ketema, will express concern at effects reduction on Asmara. Should he do so suggest Rabida use opportunity to gently point out differences Addis and Asmara opinion, both public and <pb n="3" xml:id="d300-03" facs="d300-03"/>official, on Kagnew and to suggest some Eritrean missionary work with Addis might be useful.</p>
                        <p>6. Once <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> notified suggest U.S. officers of all elements be briefed and authorized respond factually to rumors and questions which will arise.

                        <p>After an initial exchange of pleasantries the Emperor spoke at great length in Arnharic to Ambassador Minasse, who subsequently translated into English. In his remarks the Emperor made the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Ethiopia was grateful for American assistance, and firmly attached to its policy of cooperation with the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. The Ethiopian security situation has sharply deteriorated in the recent past.</p>
                        <p>3. Soviet influence in East Africa and the Indian Ocean areas has grown greatly.</p>
                        <p>4. The Soviets are providing large amounts of modern military equipment to Somalia, the Sudan, Yemen, and the Eritrean Liberation Movement.</p>
                        <p>5. The Chinese Communists are also active in the area and have established great influence in Tanzania and Zambia through the Tanzam Railroad project. The Chinese Communists are also competing with the Soviets for influence with Ethiopiaʼs neighboring state and with the Eritrean Liberation Movement.</p>
                        <p>6. All the countries surrounding Ethiopia with the exception of Kenya are now subject to a high and increasing degree of Communist influence and are receiving a high and increasing amount of Communist military assistance.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d302-02" facs="d302-02"/>
                        <p>7. Ethiopiaʼs position as a friend of the United States and Ethiopiaʼs role -- in the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and elsewhere -- as a force for stability in the area, make Ethiopia a bulwark against and therefore a target for Communist influence in the area.</p>
                        <p>8. The problem is complicated by the fact that Sudan, Somalia, and the Eritrean rebels have claims against Ethiopian territory.</p>
                        <p>9. The young people in Ethiopia are opposed to Ethiopiaʼs policy of friendship with the United States (for instance Kagnew Station) for they think it endangers Ethiopian security.</p>
                        <p>10. Ethiopia needs more military help from the United States both for hard security reasons and to demonstrate to its people that Ethiopian policy does meet the countryʼs security needs.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Ethiopia was already receiving the highest priority of any African country in U.S. assistance programs. He said that our military assistance to Ethiopia comprises about 60 percent of our total military assistance to African countries. The President said we were glad to help and would continue to help but that there were limits on our resources.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood the Ambassadorʼs message to be as follows: The threat to Ethiopian security had increased, and was now more serious than it was assessed to be in American Government circles. Therefore, the military assistance programs which had been adequate in the past were no longer adequate to the need of a deteriorating security situation. The Emperor confirmed that that was the thrust of his presentation.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would have a careful look taken at this situation with full weight given to the Emperorʼs remarks. The President directed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> to undertake the study forthwith.</p>
                        <p>The President told the Emperor that in this Administration, America knew who its friends were and that we did not intend to let our friends down. We understand fully the Emperorʼs position, and the depth of his dedication to the cause of freedom and national independence. The President pointed out that the Emperor had been an international symbol of those values long before most of the Chiefs of State at the dinner last evening had even entered public life.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d302-03" facs="d302-03"/>
                        <p>The Emperor presented to the President a personal memorandum concerning a request for additional military assistance and a study of Ethiopiaʼs security situation prepared by the Emperorʼs Ministry of Defense. The President turned these documents over to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName>, and assured the Emperor that they would be carefully studied and reflected in the new assessment of Ethiopiaʼs assistance needs which we would undertake as a result of the Emperorʼs presentation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have reviewed your memorandum of 12 September 1970 (Serial 0083) wherein you recommend deferring implementation of the subject plan. In light of the study requirement outlined in my memorandum of 16 September 1970 to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> (Enclosure 1) and the new areas it will explore, I agree that consolidation of communications functions at Kagnew under the Navy should be withheld. Accordingly, the requirement to implement the Engineering Plan should be held in abeyance pending the outcome of this study. It is hoped that this study, when completed, will provide a clearer picture of the interrelationship between communications in the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans, taking into consideration projected plans and programs, i.e., Reindeer Station, reductions at Kagnew and withdrawal from Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>I would hope that you would be able to provide the requisite data to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> for the proposed study covering as a minimum (i) your assessment of the impact Diego Garcia might have upon Kagnew over the next five years (ii) displays showing the propagation limitations of the various communication facilities, i.e., Kagnew, Harold Holt (Australia) and that proposed at Diego Garcia, (iii) and overlays showing communications coverage over-lap (if any) emanating from the Naval Communications Station in Greece and the proposed facility at Diego Garcia.</p>

                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> study reveals consolidation of the communications functions at Kagnew is still warranted I will so advise you and request submission of an engineering plan reflecting the current situation. In this regard, I suggest that any <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971-1972 Navy funds which have been identified for Kagnew consolidation be held in reserve pending the outcome of this action.</p>

                        <p>1. Somali Ambassador ADDOU called on Asst. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> December 23 prior to his departure December 28 or 29 for Mogadiscio for consultations. ADDOU said one of major reasons for returning was to attempt to persuade General SIAD to stop Somali flag vessels from trading with North Vietnam and Cuba. He said Somalia receives little of value from this traffic and monetary gain is not comparable to former US aid program. ADDOU believes many GSDR officials are convinced termination of aid was predetermined USG policy and shipping problem was only excuse to stop aid. ADDOU is under no illusions about difficulty of his task. He specifically asked, however, what aid could USG provide if shipping problem was resolved.</p>

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> briefly reviewed history of US-Somali aid relations, noting that even before change of Somali government, our bilateral aid program was tentatively scheduled to end after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added that it was not possible to make any promises or specific predictions. At same time, if Somali flag shipping to North Vietnam and Cuba is terminated, USG might be able to go forward with x certain regional and multidonor projects and self-help assistance which is now prohibited by application of Section 620(n). <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added we will try to do all we can to let GSDR know of our desire for good relations, but said it is not possible to go beyond that statement.</p>
                        <p>3. When asked if he was still planning to visit Somalia in near future, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> responded that he would probably not be able to make another African trip during first 3 months of 1971.

                        <p>I. SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The most important U.S. policy objectives in Somalia are I) to support Somali efforts toward economic development and improvement of govern-mental efficiency; 2) to seek continuation of the detente in the Horn of Africa and encourage regional cooperation; 3) to support a policy of true non-alignment; and 4) to strengthen Somaliaʼs ties with the West.</p>
                        <p>Since its establishment in October 1969, the Army-dominated revolutionary regime has firmly established itself in power but has not yet won the confidence of important segments of the population. The Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) has set reasonably sound goals for economic development and social reform and is attempting to achieve them by making maximum use of Somaliaʼs own resources. However, as the Somali economy is depressed and resources scarce, the SRC will continue, in large measure, to be dependent on foreign aid to reach its long-range development objectives. Soviet influence is strong in Somalia, particularly in the Army, because of the presence of Soviet technical and military advisers, the number of which has increased over the past year. The SRC is seeking through various means -- including the establishment of “Scientific Socialism” as its ideology -- to win broad acceptance and to enlist the support and co-operation of the population as a whole in carrying out its plans.</p>
                        <p>In its foreign relations Somalia: is non-aligned but leans toward the East. With the sharp decline of the U.S. presence over the past year Italy remains the most influential of the Western powers represented in Mogadiscio. The GSDR continues the detente with respect to Ethiopia, Kenya and the TFAI, strongly condemns the white-dominated regimes of southern Africa and is a vociferous champion of African independence. Somalia, as a Muslim country, maintains close ties with the key Arab states, particularly with the UAR.</p>
                        <p>Specific recommendations on U.S. policy under the present circumstances in which U.S. influence in Somalia is severely limited are briefly out-lined in Section IV of this airgram.</p>

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>After your October 25 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> you directed <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">MARSHALL WRIGHT</persName> of my staff to give you an assessment of the Emperorʼs claim that his security situation has deteriorated significantly in the past several years.</p>
                        <p>The Emperorʼs assertions were correct. Items contributing to the worsening security situation are:</p>
                        <p>-- In 1969 leftist and pro-Russian military groups seized power in both the Sudan and Somalia, both of which countries have an unresolved territorial dispute with Ethiopia.<lb/>-- The Russians are the sole arms and military assistance suppliers to the Sudan and Somali military forces.<lb/>-- The militant Arab states have sharply increased their assistance to the Eritrean Liberation Front, a Muslim group which aims at the independence of a substantial part of the Ethiopian Empire. As a result, <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> activities have increased dramatically and caused the Ethiopian Government to declare martial law throughout the province of Eritrea.<lb/>-- The Chinese Communists are building the 1, 200 mile Tanzam Railroad through. Tanzania and Zambia and the Chicoms have now undertaken to equip and train the Tanzanian armed forces.<lb/>--In short, communist influence appears markedly on the rise among the Emperorʼs immediate and unfriendly neighbors as well as more widely in East Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d307-02" facs="d307-02"/>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are other factors which substantially reduce the threat to Ethiopian security. Neither Somalia nor the Sudan is capable of mounting a sustained attack against Ethiopia. Despite the relative increase in the strength of her neighbors, Ethiopia continues to have by far the strongest and most effective military establishment in the area.</p>
                        <p>We believe the Emperor fears that the U.S. intends to terminate our military assistance program for Ethiopia. That fear, we believe, rather than any immediate concern with his security situation, was the motivation behind his presentation to you. We have, therefore, taken two steps to meet his concern. First, we have sent a message from you expressing your understanding for his concern with his security situation and assuring him that we intend to continue a significant military assistance program in the coming years. The message also informs him that you have instructed our military mission in Addis Ababa to make itself available for discussions to identify the priorities for the continuing program. Secondly, we have restored million to the Ethiopian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program for 1972 which had earlier been<lb/>out by OMB.</p>
                        <p>A more detailed assessment of the Ethiopian security situation and of our response to the Emperorʼs concern is found attached at Tab A.</p>

                        <p>At his October 25 meeting with you <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> renewed his 1969 request for more military assistance and asserted that the Ethiopian security situation has deteriorated in the last several years. You directed that we give you an assessment of the validity of his assertion.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor is correct. The past two years have brought a clear deterioration in the overall political situation in the East Africa area, and there has been a sharp increase in the military hardware available to hostile neighboring states. Factors contributing to this assessment are:</p>
                        <p>-- In 1968, Sudan and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> signed a $60 million arms agreement. Deliveries thus far have included 24 Mig 21 jet fighters, 55 tanks, and a number of transport aircraft.<lb/>-- In May 1969, a leftist military group seized power in the Sudan. The group is hostile to Ethiopiaʼs friendship with Israel and provides assistance to Moslem separatists in Ethiopia.<lb/>-- In October 1969, the Soviet trained and equipped Somali Army seized power and Somali policy since that time has been increasingly pro-Soviet and anti-American. The ruling group is erratic and highly nationalistic, characteristics of significance in view of the longstanding Somali claims to a portion of Ethiopia.<lb/>-- Since 1963, the Somalis have received about $40 million of Soviet military equipment and there are credible rurnors of an enlarged program of assistance.<lb/>-- The Eritrean Liberation Front, a Muslim rebel group seeking the independence of Ethiopiaʼs northern-most province, has been reinvigorated in the last year by assistance from radical Arab states. The<lb/>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d307-04" facs="d307-04"/>current level of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> terrorism, although still no threat to overall Ethiopian control, is more intense and more widespread than at any time in recent years.<lb/>-- The Chinese Communists have lent Tanzania and Zambi over $400 million to build a 1200 mile rail link from Zambia to the coast, and, in January 1970, undertook to arm and train the Tanzanian armed forces.<lb/>-- In March 1968, the Soviets began to project their naval presence into the Indian Ocean. Since then, there have been 49 naval visits to 24 ports in 16 countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Factors Which Lessen the Threat to Ethiopian Security</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Taken in isolation, the facts cited above portray an excessive picture of the security threat which Ethiopia now faces. There are other factors which substantially reduce the short-run threat to Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>-- The Sudanese Government is faced with a serious revolutionary movement in the South which substantially reduces both the inclination and ability of the Sudanese Government to harm Ethiopia.<lb/>--According to our best intelligence, both the Sudanese and Somali forces are having severe difficulties in absorbing the impressive amounts of Soviet military equipment which they have received. It is not at all likely within the next several years at least, that either will attain a level of quality comparable to that of Ethiopian military forces.<lb/>-- Even were they to do so, neither country has the capacity to support sustained combat operations against Ethiopia.<lb/>-- Despite the relative deterioration of Ethiopiaʼs position, Ethiopian forces continue to be superior in both numbers and quality to that of any credible combination of forces in the area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Overall Assessment of Ethiopiaʼs Security Position</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ethiopia exists in an area of congenital tension and instability. Long-standing border disputes, irredentist political movements, and active insurgency movements compound the situation. Recent political developments in the area are distinctly unfavorable in terms of Ethiopiaʼs long <pb n="5" xml:id="d307-05" facs="d307-05"/>range security. The threat, however, is more potential than immediate and Ethiopiaʼs military strength is adequate to deal with any military attack which can be deemed at all likely. To a certain extent, Ethiopian attempt to maintain an overwhelming military superiority as compared to its potential enemies is self-defeating, for Ethiopian superiority engenders a large appetite on the part of Ethiopiaʼs neighbors for Soviet military assistance. Yet the animosity and political trends of Ethiopiaʼs neighbors is such that Ethiopia can hardly be expected to feel secure with anything less than clear military superiority.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">What Do We Do About the Emperorʼs Request</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think there is a sharp distinction between what the Emperor says he wants and what, in fact, he really wants. He expresses his needs in terms ʼof new agreements on force goals for the Ethiopian air force and navy, modernization, assistance with Ethiopian counter-insurgency problems and support for the Ethiopian militia. In all probability, however, his real fear is that we intend soon to terminate or drastically cut back the size of our military assistance program to Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>From his point of view, this fear is altogether rational. Our military assistance program for the past 10 years has been keyed to the 1960 agreement to equip a 40, 000 man Ethiopian Army. That program is all but completed. Although we in fact plan to continue a military assistance program comparable in size to those of recent years, the Ethiopians do - not know this. Nor, in all probability, do they realize that on-going support, spare parts, and replacements for the existing Ethiopian force,ʼ necessarily involves a program of significant dimensions. Nor, for that matter, have we ever told them that we intend to continue on-going support for the force we have now equipped.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, altogether likely that for the past several years the Emperor and his Defense advisors have feared that we considered ourselves approaching the end of our commitment to Ethiopia for military assistance, and they have been anxious to establish a new basis for continuing the U.S. program.</p>
                        <p>We know, for instance, that the Emperor has been deeply concerned about the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and has on several occasions expressed the fear that it will mean a sharp cut-back in American assistance to its friends abroad (read Ethiopia). More significantly, we also know that the Emperor was extremely reassured by his meeting with you on October 25 In view of the fact that you were totally non-commital about his specific requests, the only way to account for that reassurance is your vigorous statement that <pb n="6" xml:id="d307-06" facs="d307-06"/>“we know who our friends are” and that our friends can count on our continuing support.</p>
                        <p>We have, therefore, sent a personal message to the Emperor keeping completely away from the specifics of his request for military equipment, but making it plain that we contemplate the continuation of a significant military assistance program to Ethiopia, and urging that Ethiopiaʼs priority needs be worked out between our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Addis Ababa, and the Ethiopian Ministry of Defense. This, I believe, will meet the Emperorʼs basic need, which is a firm reassurance that his country is not about to be cut adrift.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we have instructed our Embassy in Addis Ababa to renew consultations as soon as possible with Ethiopian authorities to examine Ethiopian needs, and, to the maximum extent possible within prevailing fiscal guidelines, to incorporate those needs in the on-going military assistance program for Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we have restored a one million dollar cut made by OMB in the 1972 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Ethiopia. This will keep our program at a steady level and permit us to respond to some of the Ethiopian desires for modernization.</p>
                        <p>We will thus have established with both the Ethiopians and our own bureaucracy the fact that Ethiopia continues to have a priority claim to military assistance funds available for Africa and that you wish, within the fiscal limitations of that program, to be as responsive as possible to Ethiopian needs for additional military assistance.</p>
                        <p>This is not, in fact, a new policy, but rather a confirmation at the Presidential level of what we are already doing. Military assistance to Ethiopia is seen clearly, by both the Ethiopians and ourselves, as payment for our major communications [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] station at Kagnew. While the Emperor lives, while we still have a need for Kagnew (a recent study deemed it essential for the next 5 years, at least), and while the general posture of the Ethiopian Government remains acceptable, it is hardly conceivable that we would terminate the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program to Ethiopia.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I feel conscience-bound to bring to your attention a situation that could, without much warning, become a major foreign policy problem for the Administration. It concerns our operations in Ethiopia, specifically Kagnew Station and the exposed position of its 3,500 Americans. The danger is that the situation could develop into what the vulgar and the hostile might view as “another Viet-Nam” type situation. (A recent memo from State is at Tab B.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Background</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I first became seriously concerned about Kagnew in November as a result of stepped-up terrorism in the area by the Eritrean Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>). Radical Arab support of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, some of whose guerrillas have received El Fatah training, compounded my worries. I hosted an informal meeting with State and Defense personnel on December 3rd in order to learn more about the situation and the degree to which American personnel and installations were exposed. I learned that we were indeed vulnerable to <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> attack, even though we had been spared up to now. I generated some measures aimed ʼat tightening our security procedures.</p>
                        <p>Since then, the situation has worsened considerably. In December, the Ethiopian Commanding General in Eritrea was ambushed and killed, martial law was declared in the region, and the Ethiopians publicly acknowledged that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> was receiving outside support. This month, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> killed an American for the first time, (whether purposely or not is unclear). A few days ago the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> for the first time threatened to sabotage Kagnew Station in retaliation for US military assistance to Ethiopia. There are also credible reports circulating among western embassies in Addis Ababa that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> plans to kidnap an ambassador, perhaps ours.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the immediate <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> threat, we have the additional complication of the Emperorʼs health. Dick Helms summed up this worry in a “world problem” memorandum to you of January 14. He said: “[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] .… Should he die or otherwise be eliminated from <pb n="2" xml:id="d308-02" facs="d308-02"/>the throne, tribal divisions and elitist rivalries could result in destructive civil war or fragmentation of the empire … Unless a strong central government … emerges … Ethiopia could fall apart or become the scene of an East-West confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Soviet involvement in the Sudanʼs efforts to put down a rebellion in Southern Sudan is another East-West factor. Israel and Ethiopia have been assisting Sudanese rebels.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Action Taken So Far</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The following measures, some in response to my December meeting with State and Defense, have been taken:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The number of guards patrolling Kagnewʼs facilities has been increased by 60. (26 Americans, 34 Ethiopians.) The first American guards have already been sent to Ethiopia.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Two US Army helicopters are to be sent to Kagnew within the next 60 days for use in ferrying personnel and in mail runs. (This will get us off the highways, the most dangerous place to be right now in Eritrea.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>An Army security team is going to Kagnew to see how security might be further improved.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Travel restrictions have been placed on all American personnel to insure their safety.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Radio communications between Kagnew facilities and Ethiopian security units have been improved.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Special precautions have been taken by our Ambassador in Addis Ababa and Consul General in Asmara to guard against their being kidnapped.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Frankly, these measures could prove to be totally inadequate, for the hard fact is that attacks on our people in Ethiopia could commence and escalate quickly and face the Administration suddenly with very difficult choices. These would range from a precipitous withdrawal from Ethiopia to a dramatically deepened involvement there made necessary to maintain Kagnew and the security of our</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Somalia has “virtually lost its independence” to the Soviet Union. The Somali military is in charge of the government and Soviet advisers have a preeminent position in the Somali military. A Soviet Colonel is the principal adviser to Somali military intelligence and; sees General Siad regularly. The Soviets are also influential in the Ministry of Information and are now moving into the economic areas and a Soviet adviser is being appointed in the Presidentʼs office td coordinate the work of economic ministries.</item>

                            <item>The Chinese are active in economic projects. The latest is an offer, which the Somalis are considering seriously, for a 2,000-mile road to be constructed from Mogadiscio to Berbera. The Chinese would offer a no interest, long term loan.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>General SIAD remains suspicious of the U.S. His suspicion is undoubtedly fed by the Soviet advisers and by the younger officers who are supporters of the Soviets. The cutting off of aid and continued U.S. military assistance to Ethiopia also feed these suspicions. General SIAD still believes that aid was cut off in order to undermine his regime. He claims that he had been prepared to withdraw the ships from trade with North Vietnam but our public announcement of the cutting off of aid came too soon.</item>

                            <item>While relations with Kenya are good, relations with Ethiopia are deteriorating. Both the Ethiopian Ambassador in Mogadiscio and the Somali Ambassador in Addis spoke about this deterioration. Ambassador ADDOU did not give me specifics but suggested that the atmosphere was such that incidents could erupt at any time.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Ambassador ADDOU raised specifically with General SIAD the possibility of a visit by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>. General SIAD said he would welcome such a visit. The Ambassador stressed that he too felt that such a visit could still be useful (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> advised him that he was seriously considering a visit in May).</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The position of the Italians is still strong and hope-fully continued expressions of Italian interests in the economy and in business with Somalia will serve to maintain the influence. All Western influence in Somalia, however, is threatened by the current Soviet domination.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Ambassador ADDOU said he saw very little that the U.S. could do under present circumstances but urged that we keep open our communications. He said that the greatest preoccupation in Somalia is still the settlement of disputed territories with Ethiopia. Realizing all the difficulties he said that the one action which could reestablish American influence among the Somali military would be U.S. pressure on Ethiopia to settle the questions of the Ogaden and the Haud. Such a settlement would not need to provide all of the territory claimed by Somalia. Undoubtedly, Somalia would settle for less and American association with such a settlement could reverse the present trend.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador ADDOU called at his request for a further private meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>. Referring to their conversation of February 24 the Ambassador asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> had had time to reflect on the Ambassadorʼs proposal that the U.S. encourage Ethiopia to make a territorial adjustment in favor of Somalia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that he had certainly reflected on their previous conversation. The question of the U.S. role in the territorial problems between Ethiopia and Somalia had long been an element in US-Somali relations. The U.S. did not believe that it was in a position to encourage any nation to give up territory and particularly a friendly nation such as Ethiopia. At the same time the U.S. recognized that a situation existed in the Horn of Africa where peoples traditionally had wandered back and forth across current political boundaries. Perhaps in such a situation the solution was not to try to redraw the boundaries but in effect to set aside the boundary question by establishing forms of regional cooperation. The U.S. had shown an interest previously, an interest shared by the World Bank and others, in the joint development of water resources in the Somalia-Ethiopia-Kenya area. Examples exist elsewhere in Africa where nations have successfully resolved frontier problems by regional economic cooperation. Current arrangements between Algeria and Morocco are of such a nature.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d311-02" facs="d311-02"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador, without responding to this approach, emphasized that Somalia wants good relations with the U.S. but that it is difficult under present circumstances to find a way to improve current relations. The orientation of the Somali Government is naturally affected by economic assistance. The Soviet Union is prepared to provide aid to Somalia. The Somali Republic is there-fore responsive to Soviet views on issues such as Uganda where the Somali stance, in part at least, reflects Soviet views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said he was astonished to hear that the Somali Republic would be influenced on an African issue by pressures from an aid donor. In his time as Assistant Secretary Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said he could not recall any time at which the U.S. put pressure on an aid recipient on an African issue. He could not understand why the Somali Government claimed that the U.S. efforts to restrict shipping with North Vietnam, a matter of direct interest to the U.S., would be looked upon as a violation of Somali sovereignty whereas the Somali Government would permit the Soviets to influence their views on an African matter with which the Soviet Union has no relationship.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. wants good relations with the Somali Republic but it is difficult in such circumstances to see any real indication that this is shared by the Somali Republic. The initial actions of the present Somali Government in throwing out the Peace Corps, in expelling official Americans and in the treatment of private American citizens are not forgotten and certainly do not help the climate of relations either officially or in the private sector. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> acknowledged that Ambassador ADDOU had worked hard and courageously for good relations. For this reason Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> regretted speaking so bluntly to him but it was important that he understand the situation as seen from Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d311-03" facs="d311-03"/>
                        <p>Ambassador ADDOU said that he understood the American feelings but that the cases mentioned were all in the past. The present government feels that the U.S. is not doing anything which was not agreed upon with the old government and therefore it has not shown any clear interest in the new government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> emphasized that the decision to proceed with the Mogadiscio water project was made against some considerable reluctance in Washington after the revolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> was disappointed that there was so little acknowledgement by the Somali Government that such a step had been taken in the face of all the problems that existed. He said he also felt obliged to tell the Ambassador that the withdrawal of the ships from trade with North Vietnam would certainly improve the atmosphere but given other U.S. commitments the U.S. could make no promise on the resumption of any major bilateral program.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador ADDOU said he realized the many problems that existed but he did hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> would continue with his plans to visit Mogadiscio. General SIAD welcomes frank talk and a review of some of these aspects with him would be useful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said his current plan, although still tentative, was to visit Mogadiscio early in May. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HFL1">Hadsel</persName> was so informing Foreign Minister Arteh.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">I. PURPOSE</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This study is intended to pose alternatives for U.S. policy towards the Horn of Africa--Ethiopia, Somalia and French Territory of the Afars and Issas (TFAI)--in the light of: (1) the current situation; (2) the potential difficulties which may well arise in the area over the next five years; (3) the demonstrated Soviet interest in the area; and (4) our desire to retain our Kagnew communications facility located in Asmara, Eritrea, for at least the next five years. By identifying the nature of US interests in the Horn and the policy choices available to the United States in various contingencies, this paper will offer a basis for choosing among policy alternatives. In particular, it will examine the key issue of the degree to which the US should become involved in Ethiopiaʼs counterinsurgency operations in order to protect our interests.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">II. U.S. INTERESTS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. General. US interests in Ethiopia are considerably more important than our interests in Somalia or than those in Sudan. Ethiopia has been a major focal point of U.S. activity in Africa having received $250 million in US economic assistance since 1948 and $150 million in military aid since 1953. Two <pb n="2" xml:id="d312-02" facs="d312-02"/>types of US interests in Ethiopia may be distinguished: (l) our direct and tangible interest in maintaining a US communications facility at Kagnew and (2) our broader interests stemming from Ethiopiaʼs size, location and population; its traditional friendship with the United States; and the moderating influence it has exercised in African affairs and the third world under the leadership of Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>. U.S. interests in Somalia are largely derivative of our interests in Ethiopia. They center on preserving regional stability but include a possible interest in future access to Somali ports and air facilities.</p>
                        <p>B. Kagnew Station. The importance of Kagnew Station to the US has been a major determinant of our scale of involvement in Ethiopia and has shaped our regional policies. Established in 1942 as a small communications station when we obtained the site from the British, Kagnew has grown (primarily because of its ideal location for [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and communications-[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]) up of over 1900 US employees (1700 of which are military), 1600 dependents and over 1700 local personnel. Kagnew Station was developed pursuant to the US-Imperial Ethiopian Government (<gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss>) Base Rights Agreements of 1953 which runs until 1978 and is then subject to one yearʼs termination notice by either party. While the US pays nominal land rent, the quid pro quo for use of the facility is our military assistance program which, over the last five years, has averaged $12-13 million annually.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d312-03" facs="d312-03"/>
                        <p>Kagnew functions include [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] separate US Army and Navy communications links [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. If it becomes necessary to withdraw from Kagnew, however, it is not proposed that the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] facility be relocated; rather efforts would be made to obtain [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. By that time, according to the study, it should be possible to tell what, if anything, is needed in later years. If it appears that the<lb/>US will have a continuing need for Kagnew Station beyond 1978, the study forecasts that it would be for a fairly small, well-equipped communications station [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] from the present complex.</p>
                        <p>A satellite concept has been approved by the Secretary of Defense and, if funded, a US military tactical satellite system satisfying most Navy communications needs could be operational in the mid to late 1970s. Because funding constraints and ship overhaul schedules would not permit installation of satellite communications transceiver terminals in all Navy ships at one time, certain high frequency (HF) stations would still be <pb n="4" xml:id="d312-04" facs="d312-04"/>required beyond this time frame to cover the transitional period until all ships and ground stations could be configured. A current study concludes, therefore, that some of the HF functions being performed at Kagnew may be required even after a military tactical satellite system covering the Western Indian Ocean, Red Sea and Persian Gulf is operational.</p>
                        <p>A separate but related communications system located at Kagnew is the Defense Communications System (DCS) which primarily provides point-to-point communications. Plans for deployment of a DCS tactical and strategic satellite system to replace these functions have neither been approved nor funded and a satellite system would not be deployable within the time frame of this paper. Because of the isolation of Kagnew Station from Middle Eastern and European communication nodal points, the employment of non-satellite communication technologies, e.g., microwave, troposcatter, in place of the present HF systems is not feasible.</p>
                        <p>In addition to its cost in US military aid, Kagnew has imposed some political costs on both Ethiopia and the United States. It is the larger of two remaining US operated military facilities in Africa and as such draws some criticism from African states opposed to foreign military presence in Africa. In Ethiopia, students and other elements of the young educated urban class have criticized our facility in Asmara. Most of the Ethiopian elite, however, tend to regard it favorably as <pb n="5" xml:id="d312-05" facs="d312-05"/>inseparable from the important US aid programs. In the light of our requirements for Kagnew, the current political costs to the US seem acceptable.</p>
                        <p>If, however, we were to become openly identified by in-creasing our aid and involvement in <gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> actions against the Eritrean Liberation Front (LF) and, in retaliation, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> for the first time were to attack Kagnew and/or American personnel, these political costs would increase substantially. Political costs would also rise if the Station should become an issue among contenders for power in a succession crisis (see V A-C and VI A below).</p>
                        <p>C. Ethiopiaʼs Role as a Friendly, Moderate State. Over the past decade, Ethiopiaʼs moderating influence has served US <pb n="6" xml:id="d312-06" facs="d312-06"/>interests by helping resolve regional conflicts in Africa, minimizing great power rivalry on the continent, and strengthening the independence of African states. For example, Ethiopia acted in support of US objectives in both the Congolese and Nigerian crises. A friendly Ethiopia has benefited the US at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in other international forums. Its stabilizing role on the international scene, for example, its contribution of troops to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort in Korea and the Congo, has been in marked contrast to the attitude and policies of the more radical African states. To a large degree, this situation has been the result of our close personal relationship with the Emperor and his prestige and influence among other African countries.</p>
                        <p>During the next few years, instability within Ethiopia, the death of the Emperor, or the increasing assertiveness of other African states may diminish Ethiopiaʼs weight in African affairs. However, its status as tropical Africaʼs second most populous state, its long history of independence, its political coherence and stability as a nation, and its being the location of <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> headquarters are all factors which should help maintain continued, if reduced, Ethiopian importance in African councils. Ethiopiaʼs agricultural potential should permit continued economic development, albeit from a low base. Its military establishment, though of poor quality by Western standards and dependent on US assistance, will remain an imposing force in Africa.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d312-07" facs="d312-07"/>
                        <p>D. Promotion of Stability and Political Moderation in Somalia. A military government composed largely of younger military and police officers including a number trained in the Soviet Union, took charge of Somalia in October 1969. The regime is increasing its ties with radical Arab regimes and with the Soviet Union, whose influence in Somalia is growing. By virtue of its location and the presence of large numbers of Somalis in adjoining territories, Somalia has the potential for causing serious trouble for Ethiopia, Kenya and TFAI. This has been demonstrated in the past, and Somalia has never renounced its irrendentist claims to the Somali-populated portions of those three territories, although they have been substantially moderated in recent years.</p>
                        <p>In former years, the U.S. and 3ther Western powers were able to exercise some restraining influence on Somali aspirations and to encourage the establishment of a detente with Ethiopia and Kenya. The continuation of this detente and over-all stability in the Horn is clearly in US interests. To this end, the U.S. welcomes the continuation of as much Western influence as possible Somalia, lest the field be entirely abandoned to those whose advice would run counter to broader US interests in the Horn.</p>
                        <p>E. Strategic Importance of the Horn. Relative to global US strategic interests, the Horn is of marginal <pb n="8" xml:id="d312-08" facs="d312-08"/>strategic importance. US military movements and communications in genera: proceed directly from the US eastward and westward across the Atlantic and Pacific. We are interested in retaning access to port facilities at Massawa, Assab, and Djibouti (TFAI) and landing rights at Ethiopia airports. We also continue to have some interest in obtainang access to Somaliaʼs ports-Berbera and Chisimaio-and airfields which are now denied to us. At the same time we retain a modest naval force in the area and wish to maximize the number of ports accessible to it, particularly in countries such as Ethiopia located adjacent to the narrow straits connecting the Red Sea with the Indian Ocean. The reopening of the Suez Canal would enhance the strategic importance of the Horn and its seaports oh the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>Our interests in the Indian Ocean are generally of a moderate level as is the threat posed to them by the Soviet Union at the present time. Short iff general war, the Soviet Union or any of the littoral states would be unlikely to attempt to deny US vessels access to the Indian Ocean itself or to the Red Sea Basin. In general the principal problems facing us in the Indian Ocean arise from the political instability and the low level of economic development in many parts of the area. Our posture in Ethiopia can do little to contribute to an amelioration of this situation.</p>
                        <p>In some contingencies the availability of military landing rights in Ethiopia would be of value, particularly if access to states in the western Indian Ocean area through Turkey and <pb n="9" xml:id="d312-09" facs="d312-09"/>Iran were denied to us. The most likely contingencies might involve the necessity for evacuating American citizens should a crisis erupt in Iran or Saudi Arabia. Our ability to utilize Ethiopian facilities in politically sensitive situations in which we might wish to intervene actively east of Ethiopia would, however, be limited by difficulty in obtaining landing or overflight rights in Uganda, Congo (K), Kenya and Sudan or in effecting a long and costly detour around South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Ethiopia has been referred to as a buffer between the Soviet-influenced, radical Arab states to the north and the more moderate states of East and Central Africa. Kenya, for example, is concerned over the need to maintain a stable and moderate regime in Addis, as is the new government in Uganda. The Kenyans regard their economic cooperation and mutual defense arrangements with Ethiopia as mutually reinforcing for the two countries and a bulwark against Somali Irredentist claims in the area. The effect of Ethiopiaʼs allowing Israeli aid to southern Sudanese insurgents through its territory is to impede the spread of radical Arab influence southward by inhibiting the full integration of that region into Sudan. But the ability of African states in this area to exert military pressure against each other across their frontiers is limited; the heartlands of Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan are separated by broad areas of sparsely-inhabited territory. <pb n="10" xml:id="d312-10" facs="d312-10"/>Radical Arab or Soviet influence would be more likely to manifest itself in Nairobi or Kampala as a result of internal political developments in those countries than via Ethiopia, Somalia or Sudan.</p>
                        <p>F. Economic and Political Development. The US is committed to seeking a world of free, independent and viable states. The President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> have publicly affirmed that it is in the US interest to cooperate with African states in their efforts to achieve economic and political development. They have pledged the US within the limits of its resources to be responsive to African needs. Ethiopiaâs friendly character, its long historical relationship with the United States, its agricultural potential and generally satisfactory economic growth rate, its large population, and its lack of a former colonial patron identify it as being eligible as an important recipient of US economic aid.</p>
                        <p>G. Maintenance of International Peace and Security. In accordance with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter, the US has several broad policy commitments which are relevant to the Horn. We seek to pro-mote international peace and stability. We wish states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of other states. We are also concerned that the wishes of peoples to achieve self-determination not be disregarded. Issues of territorial <pb n="11" xml:id="d312-11" facs="d312-11"/>integrity and self-determination are very much alive in the Horn including mutually conflicting Somali and Ethiopian territorial claims, <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> demands for independence from Ethiopia, and the desire of Somali peoples outside Somalia for self-determination. To the extent that we are drawn into these regional issues, it will be in our interests to pursue regional policies which are as consistent as possible with our broader policy commitments.</p>
                        <p>H. Limiting Soviet Influence. In the Horn the extent of our concern about Soviet influence in Somalia and Sudan is in great measure a function of our interests in Ethiopia. Moscowʼs influence in Sudan and Somalia could result in improved Soviet access to the Indian Ocean; this would be especially true if the Suez Canal were opened. At present, access to Somali port facilitates Soviet operations in the Indian Ocean. Soviet identification with Khartoum serves to advance the Soviet position in the Arab world. Nevertheless, there is little that the US can do to deny these advantages to the Soviets--in Khartoum, as long as we remain identified in the Arab mind, with Israel, and in Mogadiscio as long as we maintain our support for the Ethiopian Government.</p>
                        <p>I. Trade and Investment. US trade and investment in the Horn are extremely small. Our investment in Ethiopia is only $35 million and is insignificant in Somalia. The US purchases about 60% of Ethiopiaʼs coffee production, but <pb n="12" xml:id="d312-12" facs="d312-12"/>bilateral trade with that country is insignificant as a percentage of total US foreign trade. As yet, neither Ethiopia nor Somalia has any known minerals or other resources of importance to the United States.</p>

                            <item>(S) Reference is made to a memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, dated 16 September 1970, subject: “Kenitra and Kagnew Communications Facilities,” which requested that a study of US communications functions at Kenitra, Morocco, and Kagnew Station, Ethiopia, be developed in the form of contingency relocation plans.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>(S) The plan for Kagnew Station, Ethiopia, Appendix A hereto, is forwarded as requested in the reference. The plan for Kenitra, Morocco, was submitted to you on 8 January 1971. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and were forwarded to you on 19 February 1971.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>(S) The Kagnew Station communications facilities are important to the national security interests of the United States. Loss of the station and the relocation of these facilities to other sites would result in a serious reduction of the capabilities now being provided at Kagnew Station. A complete reconstitution of the missions now performed at Kagnew Station is not possible. Circuit cost estimates for the relocation of minimal essential capabilities exceed $18 million, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. Further, the total value of an installed plant which cannot be recovered is estimated to be in excess of $60 million.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>(S) The possibility of reducing strategic communications facilities at Kagnew Station by utilization of advanced technological developments was investigated. Expansion of the use of military satellite communications capabilities would permit the reduction of high-frequency (HF) circuitry in the Defense Communications System (DCS). However, because a program has not been approved and funded, replacement of the US Navyʼs tactical HF facilities by satellite communications is not feasible at this time. Present plans for development of the military satellite <pb n="2" xml:id="d313-02" facs="d313-02"/>communications system for tactical and strategic purposes in the Indian Ocean area have not yet been funded. Because of the isolation of Kagnew Station from Middle Eastern and European DCS nodal points, the employment of other advanced communications technologies, e.g., microwave and troposcatter, is not feasible.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>(S) In planning relocation sites for the communications facilities of Kagnew Station, use of the US Navy site at Diego Garcia was considered as a suitable location from the technological standpoint. The site, however, is limited in scope to construction of an austere communications facility by an understanding with Congress. Therefore, expansion beyond the presently approved scope would require your approval and that of Congress. In addition, coordination with the Government of the United Kingdom would be necessary.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>(S) Construction at Diego Garcia will commence in March 1971 and is estimated to be completed in March 1973, at which time an interim operational capability will be available. Upon completion, an 18-month testing period will be authorized to acquire sufficient data to ascertain the feasibility of phasing down a portion of the US Navyʼs tactical communications facilities at Kagnew Station oriented towards the Indian Ocean area. If the data prove that communications for fleet operation in that geographic area can be provided from Diego Garcia, that portion of tactical communications facilities at Kagnew Station, Ethiopia, might no longer be required. Tactical HF coverage of the western Indian Ocean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf now available from Kagnew Station could not be provided from Diego Garcia, even if it were to be expanded. The most feasible alternative for Kagnew Stationʼs naval tactical HF facilities covering these areas is Bahrain Island.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>(S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that Kagnew Station communications facilities be retained to support the continuing requirement for command and control communications facilities for naval forces, Presidential communications support, the DCS, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>].</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>(S) In accordance with a memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, dated 27 October 1970, implementation of the US Navy plan for the consolidation of DCS facilities at Kagnew Station, Ethiopia, has been held in abeyance, pending the updating of Appendix A. The estimated cost of $6 million involved in implementing the consolidation plan could not be offset by projected savings in less than 5 years.</item>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d313-03" facs="d313-03"/>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>(S) Although there has been general interagency agreement on the necessity to retain Kagnew Station for at least the next 5 years, National Security Study Memorandum 115, dated 25 January 1971, subject: “Horn of Africa,” will focus on Kagnew Station and its value to the United States. In view of National Security Study Memorandum 115 and the resultant uncertainty of US tenure of Kagnew Station, the Joint Chiefs of Staff further recommend that implementation of the consolidation be reconsidered after the response has been approved by the Senior Review Group.</item>

                            <item>Detention American Owned Vessels in Somalia</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>On June 12 three U.S. owned vessels (two tugs and a work ship), a derrick and pipe laying barge, and a cargo barge used in offshore marine construction were apprehended by Somali authorities off the Somali coast while en route from Louisiana to Bahrain. All the craft are owned by SEDCO Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and its subsidiary, the Houston Contracting company of Houston. The three vessels and cargo barge fly the Panamanian flag while the derrick and pipe laying barge has U.S. registry. The crew of the vessels and barges is composed of Americans, Brazilians, and Germans. Seven Americans are included in the total, five on the derrick and pipe laying barge and two on one tug.</p>
                        <p>The exact distance of the craft off the Somali coast at the time of interception has not been established but various reports which we have received from Somali authorities and from the vessels themselves indicate that it was less than 12 miles. Somalia claims a 12 mile territorial sea. According to a radio transmission from one of the barges, the craft were fired upon by a Somali aircraft and patrol boat and required to enter the port of Mogadiscio where they are now under the custody of the Somali Government. Somali port authorities claim the craft were apprehended because they were not flying flags (except possibly on the derrick and pipe laying barge)and because they failed to respond to international signals to heave to. One of the tugs is damaged and surrounded by a reef while the cargo barge has drifted onto the beach.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d315-02" facs="d315-02"/>
                        <p>Our Ambassador in Mogadiscio was not able to see a high Somali official immediately. On June 16, however, he discussed the incident with the Somali Secretary for Communications. On June 17 he reviewed the situation in detail with the Secretary for Defense. Although the Somali Secretary for Defense has said that his Government does not desire to magnify the incident, up to now there has been no positive response by the Somalis to the specific points in our representations. The Ambassador is pressing vigorously for consular access to the Americans, which has so far been denied by the Somalis, as well as an early release of the craft. The Department of State is in frequent contact with a representative of SEDCO Inc.</p>
                        <p>At our request, Somali Ambassador ADDOU sent a cable to President SIAD when we first learned of the seizure, in which he reportedly asked that the vessels be released as quickly as possible. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> discussed the seriousness of the situation with Ambassador ADDOU on June 16, emphasizing the need for consular access and prompt resolution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State is also seeking Panamanian support in representation of their craft of registry, which may help to expedite a solution to the problem. SEDCO Inc. has obtained the services of a local Somali shipping agent and is exploring the possibility of intervention of Lloyds of London, which insures all the craft for $6 million. Since the craft are insured by Lloyds, the British Government has expressed its willingness to have the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> Ambassador in Mogadiscio support our representations to the Somali Government if we should so desire. For the time being, our Ambassador believes it advisable not to draw on the British offer.</p>
                        <p>This is the fourth in a series of incidents involving American vessels since February 1970. While an incident earlier this month was settled amicably, the current difficulty has considerably more potential for harming Somali-American relations.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d315-03" facs="d315-03"/>
                        <p>The harm done to our bilateral relations as a result of the Midnight Sun incident of last summer is still fresh in the minds of all concerned. The Department of State is taking every step possible to help prevent future incidents of this nature. Warnings to appropriate organizations and headquarters concerning the difficulties encountered while plying the waters off the Somali coast have again been made. Nevertheless, as long as so many American vessels use the lanes off Somalia, and given the. continuing suspicions and fears of the Somali Government, the potential exists for a future incident of this type.</p>

                        <p>June 13th Brief reported Somaliaʼs seizure of five American-owned vessels. Seven Americans were among the thirty US, Brazilian and German crew members involved. So far, not even our Embassyʼs most insistent efforts to achieve consular access have met with success. The Somalis claim that the ships violated their territorial waters and they claim that the vessels were not flying flags and failed to heave, to in response to inter-national signals. The only hopeful note has been the June 20 arrival in Mogadiscio of an agent of the ship owners. He seems competent, is trying to salvage the ships, and has talked to the crew, who are apparently in satisfactory shape. Both State and our Embassy intend to keep up their urgent representations to the Somalis.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Since my previous memorandum of June 18 on this subject, some progress has been made in resolving some elements of the problem of the detained vessels. There is still no indication, however, when the craft and crew will be released by the Somali Government, despite the fact that General SAMANTAR, Secretary of Defense, has twice promised our Ambassador that he would have an official reply in the “near future.” Following several representations the Somali Government finally granted our Embassy in Mogadiscio consular access with the Americans among the crew on June 23. An Embassy officer immediately got in touch with the men. The crew are being well treated. A local Somali shipping agent is assisting the American owners in efforts to resolve the problem and an American agent for the owners arrived in Mogadiscio on June 20. Four of the craft are now in a protected anchorage but the fifth, a tug, has taken five feet of water and may not be salvageable.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HFL1">Hadsel</persName> has emphasized the seriousness of the problem and the need to release the craft in numerous meetings with high level Somali officials. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> has called Somali Ambassador ADDOU to the Department on two occasions to express the same points. Our Embassy in Mogadiscio <pb n="2" xml:id="d317-02" facs="d317-02"/>has been successful in obtaining permission for a salvage tug to enter Somali waters. It is also making every effort to obtain a visa renewal for the American company representative. The assistance of the Saudi Arabian Government has been enlisted. Our respective embassies in Panama (four of the craft have Panamanian registry), Bonn (most of the crew are German nationals), Brasilia (five crew members are Brazilian), and London (Lloyds insures the craft for $6 million) have discussed the case with the host governments. To one extent or another these governments are trying to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Senior officials of SEDCO Inc. and the Houston Contracting Company are understandably concerned over the delay and continue to press strongly for the earliest possible release of the crew and craft. The Department is in frequent contact with representatives of both companies. The company officials have a better understanding of the difficulties which we face in dealing with the Somalis, however, and appear less inclined than previously to hold a press conference on the incident. At the request of the President and one of the Vice Presidents of Houston Contracting Company, the Department arranged a meeting with Somali Ambassador ADDOU at the Somali Embassy on July 2 for the purpose of discussing the incident. The meeting was cordial and Ambassador ADDOU agreed to. issue visas to both officials should they decide to proceed to Somalia. The two officials expressed appreciation for the assistance they are receiving from the Department.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HFL1">Hadsel</persName> will be seeing Foreign Secretary Omar Arteh in the next day or two. The latter has been away from Mogadiscio for the past three weeks.</p>

                            <item>We are increasingly concerned that five American-owned craft being detained Mogadiscio are not likely to be released prior to your scheduled departure July 14. While we realize that you already have postponed your departure longer than you had initially planned, depending on progress (or lack thereof) during current week in resolving this incident, we believe that it would be desirable for you to remain at post at least until we have good indication that craft will be released.

                            <item>Your departure may also indicate to GSDR that USG is becoming less interested in resolving problem. This is especially true since you, as Ambassador, have best access to top Somali officials and you personally have been handling contacts with GSDR on this matter to date. Therefore, until we can see more light at end of tunnel than currently exists, request you plan remain in Mogadiscio beyond July 14. We <pb n="3" xml:id="d318-03" facs="d318-03"/>regret any complications this decision may have on your personal arrangements, but as matter currently stands, we see no acceptable alternative to this course of action.</item>

Therefore, we leave to you best tactics in handling any delay in your departure. You may wish, for example, to use pretext of departure to schedule certain calls, e.g. on Gen SIAD, at which you would raise subject of detained craft; then decide at last minute to stay until there is significant breakthrough towards resolving matter.<lb/>End</item>

                        <p>1. IN MY FAREWELL CALL WITH PRESIDENT SRC, GENERAL SIAD WHICH LASTED OVER TWO HOURS, WE RANGED OVER A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS (REPORTED SEPARATELY). THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS ONLY THE GIST OF THE GSDR DECISION ON THE SHIPS.</p>
                        <p>2. DESPITE VARIOUS CONCERNS AND A DEEP FEELING OF RESENTMENT</p>
                        <p>AT FACT U.S. SHIPS HAVE NOW FOUR TIMES IGNORED AND VIOLATED SOMALI LAWS, SHIPS WILL DEFINITELY BE RELEASED. A FINE WILL BE LEVIED TO COVER EXPENSES (SIAD NOT SPECIFIC ON AMOUNT). SHIPS CAN LEAVE VERY SOON, PERHAPS BY THIS WEEKEND</p>

                        <p>I HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT THOSE WHO HAVE STAYED THE COURSE IN FOLLOWING THIS PROBLEM WILL READ THE SUPPLEMENTAL TELEGRAMS I AM SENDING ON THIS CONVERSATION.</p>

We know that your task has not been an easy one and that you have had to change your departure plans in order to remain in Mogadiscio to see the task through. For all of this we are most appreciative.</item>

                            <item>The assurances given you by General SIAD, General SAMANTAR and Omar Arteh are indeed encouraging. Hope-fully craft will be released by July 18 as General SIAD implied. Nevertheless we remain concerned that GSDR has not yet informed you amount of fine to be imposed or possible other conditions. Until we have this Department of State <pb n="2" xml:id="d320-02" facs="d320-02"/>specific information, and the companyʼs reaction to it, we cannot be certain that all problems relating to release of ships have been resolved.</item>

                            <item>I am fully sympathetic with your desire to be on your way, and hope that things work out so that you can in fact leave on July 18. Nevertheless, in view of intense interest in problem here I feel that it is essential that you remain at the post until conditions of release of ships are known and you are fully convinced that there are no remaining obstacles to their release.<lb/>GP-2.<lb/>END</item>

                        <p>I believe that we should continue to seek ways that might allow us to phase-down our facilities there whenever feasible. Therefore, I would like you to maintain a continuous review of our communications requirements and submit to me any changes in our need for the Kagnew facilities. Also, as requested in my memorandum of 17 July 1969, the Contingency Relocation Plan for the Kagnew Station Complex should be updated as required.</p>
                        <p>Since our own review is partly dependent upon the telecommunications requirements of the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] located there, I have suggested to the Under Secretary that it would be desirable if the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] would also review periodically its requirements.</p>

                        <p>We learned yesterday that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> had recently decided to eliminate the Army Security Agency (ASA) operation at Kagnew Station by June 30, 1972. ASA manages the Station and employs about 56% of its American personnel. ASA estimates 903 American and 350-400 local employees would be dropped.</p>
                        <p>The decision to reduce the Kagnew operation was apparently made without consultation with many interested sections of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, let alone the Department. While we have no objection in principle to the decision, we are concerned about its implementation. We have urged <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> not to send an implementation directive to the field until we have more details on the proposed cut-back and a better picture of its effects on the Ethiopian economy, the security of the abbreviated Station and our relations with the Ethiopians. We are also concerned with what effect this action may have on the future of such other activities at Kagnew as Navy Communications, Strategic Communications and Diplomatic Communications. We wish, of course, to explain the situation to the Emperor, who has consistently supported our presence at Kagnew, in a way that will have the most favorable impact on our relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> officials have assured us that they will work with the Department in preparing more detailed information to be used as a basis for deciding how best to proceed.</p>

We intend to study possible effects of proposed termination on other operations at Station, its ramifications for the Ethiopian economy and our<lb/>bilateral relations; how phase-down would be accomplished and in consultation with Embassy and Consulate General, prepare scenario for informing Ethiopians in way most likely serve our interests. <pb n="2" xml:id="d324-02" facs="d324-02"/>Dept. shares your concern and regrets that despite its efforts “rumor” has reached Ethiopia.</item>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> called Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AER1">Ross Adair</persName> in yesterday to discuss the cut in our 1972 military assistance for Ethiopia. The Emperor made it very plain that he is deeply distressed by the cut, and several times referred to his conviction that a meeting with you was desirable to discuss <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-levels and long-term relations between the United States and Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>One of the effects of the Congressional reduction of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds has been the decision to cut the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 military assistance program for Ethiopia from $12.5 to $9 million (a 28% cut). This decision was conveyed to the Ethiopian Foreign Minister a few days ago and, as expected; Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs reaction was very strong and very quick. <persName corresp="#p_AER1">Ross Adair</persName> says the Emperor spoke “in stronger terms than we can recall”, that the conversation was friendly but the “most serious I have,ever had with him”. The Emperor said the cut came “as a great blow to him” and would raise many doubts both in Ethiopia and in other countries, friend and foe alike, as to whether the US was readjusting and reducing its interest in Ethiopia and the Red Sea/Indian Ocean part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Selassie said he had felt for sometime, and let it be known, that it was desirable that he meet with you for a discussion of levels of US assistance to Ethiopia. He said that the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut was of “the utmost importance” to him and brought into question the future of the long-term friendship between our countries. He expressly asked Ross Adair to convey his deep concerns to you.</p>
                        <p>Adair replied by stressing your friendship and respect for the Emperor, but pointed out that the pressures on you this year had already caused you to forego conferences with several other world leaders. Adair also pointed out that the cuts were the result of Congressional action, and <pb n="2" xml:id="d328-02" facs="d328-02"/>that Ethiopia still received 70% of total US military assistance for Africa. The Emperorʼs reply was that he knew all that, but thought Ethiopia was entitled to special consideration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> has repeatedly used a personal visit to Washington as a device by which to increase or maintain assistance for Ethiopia. It is clear that he hopes to do so again. As of now, he has not asked for a meeting, but has made it plain that he wants an invitation. At the very least we are probably going to need to send a personal message from you to the Emperor regarding the military assistance program and the future of US policy toward Ethiopia. We are now looking into the possibility of a modest restoration of part of the cut in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Ethiopia but, of course, this must come out of someone elseʼs hide and-the hides of all our friends have been badly gored. A personal message from you and a modest increase may deflect the Emperor from treating a visit to Washington as a symbol of your continued interest in Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor promised Adair a formal communication on the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> level within the next few days. We will hold off making specific recommendations to you pending receipt of that document.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You recall that last month Haile Selassie conveyed to you his dismay over the military assistance cut Ethiopia would suffer in fiscal year 1972. Selassie was distressed to learn Ethiopia would take a 28% slice in grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aid from $12.5 to $9 million. The Emperor indicated that he might seek an appointment with you, and he sent the letter at Tab 2 urging your personal intervention on Ethiopiaʼs behalf.</p>
                        <p>We have found additional monies for Ethiopia and have also prepared a reassuring letter from you to Selassie. In addition to the current $9 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 military assistance for Ethiopia, Defense can provide $1.5 to $2 million without cutting any other country programs. This will enable us to continue a modest arms modernization program in Ethiopia to which the Emperor attaches high priority. As a further sweetener, we can offer a coastal minesweeper which initially cost $5.6 million.</p>
                        <p>Though this does not entirely restore the Emperorʼs program to earlier levels, it does demonstrate your personal concern and high regard.</p>
                        <p>Your letter, which African Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> will personally deliver to Selassie next week, says that Congress has severely limited military assistance funds, that many of our other closest friends are suffering cuts too, but that because of your desire to respond to his needs, we have managed to raise this yearʼs program. This message should minimize the Emperorʼs unhappiness, assure him of your personal good will, and dissuade him from seeking a meeting with you.</p>

                        <p>Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                        <p>Even before I received your letter of March 15, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AER1">Ross Adair</persName> had informed me of your serious concern about this yearʼs reduction in United States military assistance to your country. I appreciated your letter and I under-stand fully the concerns which you expressed.</p>
                        <p>I know you understand the stringent budgetary limitations under which the United States Government is operating this year. Because of severe Congressional reductions in our military assistance request, many of our closest friends have experienced sharp drops in United States assistance.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, in response to your concerns, I ordered a reexamination of ways in which my country might be of further assistance to Ethiopia. I am happy to inform you that we have had some success in this endeavor, more than we originally thought possible given the serious limitations we face. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, whom I have asked to deliver this letter, will be able to provide you with fuller explanations.</p>
                        <p>I know you understand how deeply I value your friendship and how highly I esteem the <pb n="3" xml:id="d329-03" facs="d329-03"/>contributions you have made to the cause of peace in Africa and the Middle East.</p>

                        <p>Unless you prefer to keep them on the Senior Review Group calendar, I recommend removing the studies on the Horn of Africa and Rhodesia from active consideration.</p>
                        <p>NSSM 142 on Rhodesia was predicated upon a successful British settlement with <persName corresp="#p_SID1">Ian Smith</persName>. It did not come about. With no early prospects for British recognition of Rhodesia, I see no need for us to further consider the policy options in the NSSM 142 study.</p>
                        <p>A review of our Horn of Africa policy is probably still a good idea but there is no urgency to do so in 1972. If you disagree, I think that we would want a fresh NSSM study rather than the March, 1971 study which was written at a time of increased <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> insurgency, of doubts about our proceeding with a small arms modernization program (M-14s) in Ethiopia or not, and when there was a conviction [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] that Kagnew was essential. Since then, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has quieted down, the American complement [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] at Kagnew has been reduced from 1500 to 900 men, and we have gone ahead with the arms modernization program notwithstanding reduced <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> levels.</p>
                        <p>Rather than keeping the NSSM 115 and 142 studies on the books any longer, I recommend killing them. If you agree, would you initial the chit for <persName corresp="#p_DJW1">Jeanne Davis</persName> at Tab 1.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On Tuesday (July 25) the Sudanese government and the State Department announced resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Sudan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> feels it would be appropriate for you to send a letter to President Nimeri on this occasion, and a draft is attached.</p>
                        <p>We have done this for the other countries -- Mauritania and Yemen--resuming ties, and the text is a straight-forward expression of pleasure and of interest in the Sudan. You have previously sent messages to President Nimeri on appropriate occasions in the absence of relations. Although there are those who see a tie between US progress in resuming relations with the Arabs and Sadat spoke against these steps until there is a change in US policy, there is little reason to avoid sending a simple letter on a step that is to our advantage.</p>
                        <p>We may not be alone in this step either. There are reports Sudan will soon re-establish relations with Iraq and with the Soviet Union at an ambassadorial level -- ties which Sudan severed after last yearʼs abortive coup which the Soviets supported and the Iraqiʼs heralded. Iran is also believed thinking about establishing ties with Sudan - a move which would be consistent with the Shahʼs strategy of building a strong network of regional relationships.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you sign the attached letter to President Nimeri. [<hi rend="italic">Text cleared by Ray Price</hi>.]</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I would like to express to you my deep gratification in the resumption of diplomatic relations between Sudan and the United States. The United States has always had a deep interest in Sudan as the largest of the African states with important historic and cultural ties with the Arab world as well. During the past two years I have followed with great personal interest your statesmanship in establishing cordial relations between Sudan and its neighbors and your leadership in achieving the reconciliation of the Sudanese people.</p>
                        <p>On this historic occasion in the relations between our two governments, I would like to assure you that the United States will continue to follow with sympathy your efforts to realize the full potential of Sudan and the Sudanese people. The United States is willing to do what it can to assist in those efforts.</p>

                            <item>The Horn of Africa is an area of chronic tensions and instability. State-to-state relations and the interests of the great powers there are affected by a complex mixture of ethnic, religious, political, and ideological conflicts. In the last year or two some of the more serious tensions have eased, and some of the groups in conflict have reached a stalemate. The reconciliation of northern and southern Sudanese has greatly improved relations between Sudan and Ethiopia. Internal dissension in the Eritrean Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>) has eased pressure on Ethiopian counterinsurgency forces. In Somalia problems within the ruling council are diverting attention from potentially risky irredentist activity.</item>

                            <item>From the US point of view the situation in the Horn appears more favorable than it has for many years. But much of this is transitory. The stability of governments and continuity of policies in this area depend greatly on the quality and strength of the national rulers. This applies especially to Ethiopia, the most important country in the Horn, and the focus of US interests. Haile Selassie, at 80, still rules his Empire with a firm hand, and has made formal arrangements for the succession of his son, Crown Prince Asfa Wossen. But the Crown Prince is not highly regarded and is likely to run into trouble in establishing a successor regime. Much will depend upon the cohesion and loyalty <pb n="4" xml:id="d332-04" facs="d332-04"/>of the armed forces, both for fending off possible externally-directed subversion and for putting down challenges from within. The odds favor the Crown Princeʼs succession, but there is certain to be some turmoil in the process.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>So far there has been little public opposition in Ethiopia to Kagnew Station, the US communications facility in Eritrea. Although it does not appear to be in much danger from the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, there is some danger that an individual or dissident faction-or even a Palestinian group-might take some hostile action against Kagnew. We judge that the Ethiopian Government is likely to permit Kagnew to continue functioning through the period of its lease (1978).</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>In Somalia President Mohammed Siad has managed to stay a step ahead of his numerous opponents, and has purged a number of his foes. His relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> currently are close, and he pro-claims a Marxist-Leninist Somali socialism. The prospects are for pro-longed instability. Even if SIAD wins this round, there will be further plotting and resistance.</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>Outside influences have always had an impact on developments in the Horn. Tensions stemming from the Arab-Israeli conflict are easing, but Israel will continue to provide important aid to Ethiopia, and will aim to maintain its influential position there. Russian influence in Somalia is considerable, particularly with the SIAD faction of the ruling council. SIAD would be unlikely to grant extensive facilities to the Soviet military, knowing that this would be unpopular in Somalia. Military aid, the basis of Soviet influence, is likely to continue, but will probably not include much, if any, of the sophisticated equipment Somalia wants. The Chinese have extended large new economic aid agreements to Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia, but over the long run are unlikely to gain substantial influence in the Horn.</item>

                        <p>DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">I. INTRODUCTION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Horn of Africa is an area of chronic tension, in which a complex mixture of ethnic, religious, political, and ideological disputes affects state-to-state relations and the interests of the great powers there.1 Ethiopia and Somalia are very poor countries whose per capita incomes, literacy rates, and social services rank them near the bottom of the worldʼs underdeveloped countries. In both countries traditional social organizations and attitudes are in competition with modern institutions and concepts advanced by the small educated elites.</p>
                        <p>1 The term “Horn of Africa” is used in this paper to mean Ethiopia, Somalia, and the French Territory of the Afars and Issas, with Kenya and Sudan on the borders and often involved in the affairs of the Horn itself.</p>
                        <p>2. Surface appearances indicate a relaxation of some of the more serious tensions and a stalemate between some of the important groups in conflict. The reconciliation of the northern and southern Sudanese, for example, has improved relations between Ethiopia and Sudan, and affected adversely the for-tunes of the Eritrean Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>). A major split within the ranks of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has served to reduce the effectiveness of its insurgency activities in Eritrea. In Somalia irredentist activity has been in abeyance in recent years.</p>
                        <p>3. From the US point of view, these are favorable developments and perhaps they arc harbingers of further movement towards reducing tensions. But the kind of equilibrium prevailing in the Horn of Africa is quite unstable and fragile, and could be upset suddenly. Some observers of the area note a growing uneasiness or sense of impending change. In part this can be attributed to the political shifts of the past year among the great powers, and changes in great power relations with countries of Africa and the Near East. The US Presidential visits to Moscow and Peking; the emergence of the Chinese in international affairs, and their substantial aid offers; the expulsion of the Soviets from Egypt and the Sudan-all have important implications for the governments of the Horn. Also, in Ethiopia and Kenya people expect changes to occur <pb n="6" xml:id="d332-06" facs="d332-06"/>following the deaths of the 80-year old national leaders. In Somalia there is also a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction, which might bring about changes that would upset the delicate balance of relationships in the Horn of Africa.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">H. ETHIOPIA</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">A. Political Dynamics</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Although Ethiopia is one of the more prominent African countries, its potential is limited. There is some basis for economic development (agriculture, grazing, tourism, and perhaps petroleum), but only modest progress has been made so far, and Ethiopia suffers from a host of natural and human constraints and obstacles. Broad deserts, a high plateau with deep gorges, and a lack of roads make internal communication difficult; low literacy rates, shortages of all types of skills, and a scarcity of medical and social services tend to slow the rate of emergence of the population from traditional ways of living.</p>
                        <p>5. Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> is both the chief innovator of, and a major obstacle to, social change. His aim is to modernize the country, but at a pace which is geared to the preservation of the ancient institutions of the Empire, the feudal nobility and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Though now 80 years old, he continues to make all important, and a great many unimportant, decisions. His rule depends primarily on the loyalty of the armed forces (his own creation), and on the support of the bureaucracy, the church, and the higher ranks of the traditional nobility-mainly his own Amhara people. The Christian Amharas, a minority in Ethiopia, cling to a privileged position, dominating a collection of diverse peoples-Christian, Moslem, and Animists.</p>
                        <p>6. National priorities and allocation of budgetary funds are determined according to the Emperorʼs perception of Ethiopiaʼs mostpressing needs. He is acutely conscious of real and imagined external threats, and worries about encirclement by hostile, often Communist-backed, Moslem states. Over the years the Emperor has favored the development of an army and air force well enough equipped to match any combination of potentially hostile neighbors. Ethiopian forces are equipped almost exclusively with US-supplied weapons and are generally considered to be one of the most effective military establishments in black Africa. Training of selected army units, and of the 8,000-10,000-man Emergency Police is conducted by US, Israeli, and other foreign instructors. Training of the armed forces has been spotty, however, and there are serious deficiencies in logistics and mobility. Most officers and men probably are loyal to the Emperor, but morale generally ranges from fair to poor. Both the army and the Emergency Police are tasked with counterinsurgency duties, while the 32,000-man regular police force attends to usual police activities and is rarely concerned with insurgency problems.</p>
                        <p>7. The Ethiopian military is heavily de-pendent on US support. If this support were substantially reduced for any reason, or with-drawn, Ethiopia would probably try to maintain its current level of military strength, first by seeking assistance from such friendly countries as France, Israel, and Great Britain. If such aid were not forthcoming, Ethiopia probably would purchase arms commercially. It probably would get along without turning to Communist sources of aid.</p>
                        <p>8. The Emperor and most of his advisors see economic development as a desirable goal, but clearly secondary to defense requirements. The Ethiopian approach to economic modernization, a slow and measured one, has paid off in the sense that there have been few hasty, impractical projects, and that the country has not been so troubled by the surge of <pb n="7" xml:id="d332-07" facs="d332-07"/>migration to the cities as many other African states. The Emperorʼs restraining hand, and a succession of competent finance ministers have managed to keep inflation down and foreign debts at a manageable level. Debt service is rising much faster than exports, but re-payments are likely to level out in the next few years, and enough foreign aid will be coming in to take care of the debt service and to carry forward the relatively modest economic plans.</p>
                        <p>9. Even the halting moves towards modernization have created new tensions. Western or locally educated urban elites are impatient at the restraints imposed by the Emperor and the powerful traditional alliance of church and nobility. In recent years secondary and university students have been the most demonstrative of the modernists. The Emperor and his security forces have applied a mixture of toughness and leniency which has generally succeeded in isolating and quelling the student disturbances, without completely alienating the modernists. The Emperorʼs will has prevailed, but at a cost of frequent disruptions of the educational processes. Student discontent, abetted by others in the modernist camp, is likely to manifest itself again but security forces will be able to contain it. Divisions within the elite are likely to become more pronounced, even while the Emperor lives. After his death, the frustrated advocates of reform will make a major effort to attain influence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">B. Internal Security Problems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. Most of the non-Amhara peoples of Ethiopia are not enamoured of the prevailing political arrangements.2 There is no grievance mechanism except personal appeals to the Emperor. The officials they encounter are generally Amharas, unsympathetic and uninterested in local problems. There are no political parties in Ethiopia, and the elected members of Parliament are generally conservative property owners. The non-Amhara educated elite, a small group, are frustrated by the lack of economic and social progress in their provinces, but the bulk of the population does not hold very high expectations of economic betterment. The general tendency is to tolerate existing conditions. Hence, there appears little prospect of an effective popular uprising or serious tribal dissidence, at least so long as a strong central government has at its disposal a substantial military force.</p>
                        <p>2 There has never been a census of the Ethiopian population. The estimated ethnic composition is 40 percent Gallas; 32 percent Amharas and Tigrais; 9 percent Sidamo peoples; 6 percent Shankellas; 6 per-cent Somalis; 7 percent others. Estimates place the total population at something between 20 and 25 million.</p>
                        <p>11. There are, however, two special problems of internal security which have no easy solution-the Ogaden and Eritrea. The Ogaden, an arid wasteland in the southeast, is inhabited by a half-million nomadic Somalis, many of whom cross into Somalia on seasonal migrations. Somalia does not recognize the Ethiopian border, which was drawn by colonial powers. In the early 1960s, following Somaliaʼs independence, Mogadiscio sponsored an intermittent guerrilla war in the Ogaden, which culminated in a brief border conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia. At the moment an uneasy truce prevails, the legacy of a detente policy carried out by a previous civilian government in Somalia. An Ethiopian army division is in the Ogaden, and on rare occasions it clashes with small bands of Somali nomads.</p>
                        <p>12. The Government of Somalia still lays claim to the Ogaden (as well as to Somali-inhabited lands in Kenya and the French Territory of the Afars and Issas), but is too weak militarily to seize it. Recently Ethiopia and Somalia have held a number of discussions over the disputed territory. It is highly unlikely that any Ethiopian government would cede any Ogaden territory to Somalia. The <pb n="8" xml:id="d332-08" facs="d332-08"/>Government fears to set a precedent for other dissatisfied groups, and regards the Ogaden as strategically important. National pride is heavily involved on both sides.</p>
                        <p>13. The Somali Government has sent off to North Korea a number of recruits for guerrilla training, some of whom (including tribesmen from the Ogaden) have already returned. There is a good chance, therefore, that the insurgency will be revived, although this would probably not involve regular Somali forces, and would not cause insurmountable problems for Ethiopian Armed Forces in the Ogaden. A potentially complicating factor is the oil drilling activity, conducted by an American firm in the southern part of the Ogaden. Oil discovered so far has not been in commercially exploitable quantities. If there were a major oil strike, the Ethiopians would pay considerably more attention to physical security in the area.</p>
                        <p>14. While the unsettled status of the Ogaden ties down a quarter of the Ethiopian Army, even larger numbers of Ethiopian security forces arc engaged in combatting the current low level insurgency in Eritrea. These forces, which include the Second Division of the Army, the village militia, and 3,500 men of the Emergency Police, go through the motions of search and destroy, hoping that the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> will eventually destroy itself by fratricide. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> began its activities nearly 10 years ago, when Ethiopia formally annexed the federated ex-Italian colony, thereby reducing Eritrea to provincial status. The subsequent influx of Amhara administrators and their disregard for Eritrean sensitivities estranged a good part of the educated elite. Some of this elite went into exile in Arab countries and organized the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. By the mid-1960s scattered bands of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> guerrillas were roaming the mountains and lowlands of Eritrea, collecting “taxes” from peasants, disrupting communications, harassing officials, and attacking isolated Ethiopian Army and police units.</p>
                        <p>15. The <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> continues to carry out harassment operations, but within the past year it has been torn by factional feuding to the extent that most of its energies and weapons are directed at rival groups. There are now two major divisions of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> and a number of factions within each. Apparently the quarrels originated as a contest for control among the leaders living in exile, which soon was extended to the units in the field. A few of the contending factions seem to have identifiable characteristics, i.e., Christian, non-Christian, tribally-based, or closely connected with particular Arab backers. Christian elements appear to be declining in importance. Several attempts by Arab governments to mediate have failed.</p>
                        <p>16. In addition to the problems created for the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> by its internal fissures, its capabilities have been adversely affected by other factors as well. Until quite recently, the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> could count on using Sudan as a channel for moving arms, supplies, and recruits in and out of Eritrea and for safe haven. For some time friendly or indifferent governments in both Yemens permitted trans-shipment of sup-plies to Eritrea, and radical Arab regimes in Iraq and Syria provided <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> exile leaders with funds and access to broadcasting and other propaganda facilities. Somalia, and more recently Libya, also have provided some sup-port. Currently, Sudan is on friendly terms with Ethiopia, and this makes <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> activities in Sudan much more difficult. Other diplomatic efforts of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> have been partially successful in cutting down <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> access to Yemeni ports, and in dissuading China from aiding the rebels.</p>
                        <p>17. Because <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> internal difficulties have intensified, its policies and actions have be-come highly unpredictable. The main danger <pb n="9" xml:id="d332-09" facs="d332-09"/>at this point is that one or more of the factions may suddenly undertake new and dramatic acts of violence to gain new adherents, or out of sheer frustration. The most likely object of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> terrorism would be installations, offices, or personnel of the Imperial Ethiopian Government. Several years ago specially trained teams of <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> terrorists launched such a program, which included bombings, sabotage, and hijacking of Ethiopian commercial aircraft. At that time the terrorist program came to an abrupt halt after some conspicuous failures, and some effective Ethiopian counter-action. Another resort to terror in Eritrea probably would not gain much for the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. But terrorism in Addis Ababa-which is home to a number of international organizations including the Organization of African Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>) and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Economic Commission for Africa, and a frequent conference site--would be conspicuous and would damage the reputation of Haile Selassie and his government.</p>
                        <p>18. Thus far the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> has ignored the US installations at Kagnew Station on the out-skirts of Asmara, Eritreaʼs main center. Kagnew facilities, including the vast antenna fields and the large dish antennas are highly vulnerable to sabotage or surprise attack and offer an obvious target to the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. Installations are scattered over a wide area with villages and public roads interspersed. Large numbers of people in the course of their daily business come in proximity to buildings and equipment on the base. It would not be difficult to lob a few mortar shells into critical parts of the base area or to attack US personnel. And it would be even simpler for some of the local employees to bring explosives into the base if sabotage were the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> goal.</p>
                        <p>19. Only a few Americans in the last couple of years have even had contact with the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>. In those instances, the rebels were mainly concerned with publicizing their cause andreassuring themselves about American neutrality in their struggle against the Imperial government. Despite the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> propaganda themes, broadcast over Arab radio stations, which link “imperialist America with Zionist Israel and feudal Ethiopia” in an unholy trinity, and the fact that many of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> terrorists are trained in countries where bitterly anti-American attitudes are common, there is no indication that any <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> leader or faction is planning hostile action against the US base or personnel.</p>

                            <hi rend="strong">C. The Imperial Succession</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. The greatest uncertainty hanging over Ethiopia, and over the Horn of Africa generally, is the Imperial succession issue. The Emperor at 80 is vigorous and fully in control of all of the instruments of power. Many of the institutions of the Empire are his own creation, molded and refined during his more that 50 years in power to fit his highly personalized style of governing. He has made formal provision for the succession by the constitutional designation of his only surviving son, Crown Prince Asfa Wossen, as the heir. More important, the Emperor appears to have the acquiescence of all of the important figures in the Ethiopian establishment.</p>
                        <p>21. But there are some disquieting aspects. The Emperor has not exerted himself to as-sure a smooth transition. <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>ʼs very success in devising an effective personal apparatus for governing is a weakness in terms of the succession, because it cannot be transmitted readily to a successor. Moreover, the Crown Prince is an uncertain quantity. At 56, he is in reasonably good health, but is inexperienced in the arts of governing and is not consulted in any way. Some foreign observers have doubts about his capacity to handle the job. Also there is the baleful historical heritage of political violence on virtually every previous succession, though the <pb n="10" xml:id="d332-10" facs="d332-10"/>last one occurred over 50 years ago. A few powerful Amharic and Tigrean nobles boast of claims to the Solomon-Sheba line of succession which are at least as good as the Crown Princeʼs, though there is no evidence of plans to advance these claims. Lastly, there is in Ethiopia a considerable accumulation of grievances by restive individuals, factions, cliques, tribes, and regions. These discontented elements are awaiting the Emperorʼs death to put forward schemes, reforms, and proposed changes, and many have exaggerated expectations of Asfa Wossenʼs receptivity to new ideas, and of his ability to bring about rapid change.</p>
                        <p>22. Much would depend upon the cohesion of the armed forces which might assume an expanded role. Currently the army is held together mainly by respect for and fear of the Emperor, and by personal allegiances based on family, clan, or marriage. Considerable rivalries have already been generated within the officer corps by the Emperorʼs practice of playing off military leaders against each other. The possibility of factional feuding among the top officers, and among the powerful nobility outside of the armed forces, is very strong. Should the army unite in sup-port of the Crown Prince (or another candidate) then the transition to a new regime could be fairly smooth.</p>
                        <p>23. While it is difficult to make any confident predictions about the course of events which would follow the death of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>, the best estimate would seem to be that Asfa Wossen will succeed to the throne, probably without serious initial challenge. Even if he blunders a bit, he would benefit from advantages that no previous Ethiopian monarch has had at the outset; a national army instead of feudal levies; a centralized bureaucracy and a national treasury rather than unruly vassals and feudal dues. He can probably also rely upon a powerful church, which is normally subservient to the throne, and a nascent sense of nationalism among the Amharas and some Tigreans and Gallas. He would probably seek to govern in a less direct and arbitrary fashion than did his father, and by so doing would assuage many who oppose the notion of absolute monarchy.</p>
                        <p>24. Yet, the honeymoon, if there is one, would probably not last long. A certain amount of turmoil is probably inevitable as the new government sorts itself out, and as a host of important groups and factions seek to mold it to their advantage. How serious the turmoil becomes, and whether the successor can hold together the Ethiopian Empire, depend upon the character of Asfa Wossen, the continued loyalty and unity of the armed forces, and the willingness of particularist factions to work for a common cause. Most of the challenges that arise will be internal, within the ranks of the establishment. But there will be peripheral incidents, which could complicate events at the center. The Eritrean rebels would almost certainly attempt some dramatic move against Imperial authority in their province, and the Somalis might decide to test the intentions and firmness of the new regime, by stirring up trouble in the Ogaden or elsewhere. If the Imperial forces retain a good degree of cohesion, they could probably handle these or other outbreaks.</p>
                        <p>25. The departure of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> would bring some changes in Ethiopiaʼs role and status in Africa. The Emperor is both a world figure and an African elder statesman. In order to cultivate and preserve that image he has on occasion taken a softer stance on important national issues than many of his ad-visors would have wished. Any successor regime in Addis Ababa would lack his confidence and assurance in international affairs, and would be likely to take more abrasive actions towards Somalia and other states with which it disagreed. The chances of renewed <pb n="11" xml:id="d332-11" facs="d332-11"/>border clashes with Somalia would increase, and probably also the chances of Somali-inspired dissidence within Ethiopia. More-over, there are certain historical imperatives that would give continuity to Ethiopian foreign policy. Any Ethiopian Government which included a strong Amhara element would see itself defending a Christian bastion against malicious Moslem neighbors. Post-Haile Selassie Ethiopia would probably welcome economic aid from whatever source, but would continue to be wary of Arabs and Communists. Ethiopians are likely also to become more wary of Westerners, and to take positions on international issues more in keeping with a general African consensus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">III. SOMALIA</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>26. Somalia is much smaller and even poorer than Ethiopia, but is relatively unified in its ethnic, linguistic, and religious (Islamic) composition. Of its three million inhabitants, the largest portion are nomads and only a small number are settled farmers. There are few towns or cities worthy of the name, and most of these are beset with serious unemployment and underemployment problems. Educated-i.e., literate-Somalis number only a few thousand and the only elites beside the tribal chiefs are military officers and government officials. Beyond the borders of the Somali Republic are some 850,000 Somali nomads living mainly in the northeast province of Kenya, the Ogaden area of Ethiopia, and in the French Territory of the Afars and Issas (TFAI ). There is a consensus in Somalia favoring the proclaimed national goal of Greater Somalia-i.e., annexing the lands where Somalis predominate-but little sense of urgency in pursuing irredentism.</p>
                        <p>27. Despite these unifying factors, Somalia is a politically unstable state. Conditions of life in this harsh, semidesert environment have fostered a strong sense of individualism,loyalty to clan and kin rather than to nation, and a tendency to resist regimentation and government control. Clans and kin-groups are often at odds with one another, and internal peace is preserved largely through a traditional system of clan-administered justice. The parliamentary democracy which prevailed from independence in 1960 until the military coup of 1969 gave expression to Somali individualism and provided a rough balance of the clans in government, but nepotism and corruption eventually destroyed public confidence in the system.</p>
                        <p>28. In the current government, executive and legislative powers are wielded by the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), a self-appointed group of some 20 military officers plus a few police officers. Major-General Mohammed Siad is the President of the Council, and theoretically is bound by Council decisions. In practice he is establishing a pre-eminent position for himself, and has begun to issue decrees in his own name. He is en-countering resistance from within the Council, however, and is not yet in a position to disregard his colleagues. SIAD is a professional soldier who rose from the ranks to the position of Commanding General of the Somali National Army. In true Somali fashion he has favored close relatives and members of his clan, both in governmental appointments and in the Councilʼs frequent squabbles.</p>
                        <p>29. The Somali leadership is intensely nationalistic. In the early days of the military regime (1969-1970), it leaned towards a Qaddafi-type of Islamic puritanism. This tendency now seems somewhat blurred as evidence of corruption and high living comes in. But there is still a residue of idealistic fervor, mostly connected with SIADʼs Somali socialism. This concept, still fuzzy, is defined by the President as an adaptation of Marxism-Leninism to Somali society. Most large foreign businesses have been nationalized, and <pb n="12" xml:id="d332-12" facs="d332-12"/>local merchants have suffered from scarcity of goods as a result of government imposed regulations.</p>
                        <p>30. Much of the rhetoric about socialism appears to be a smoke screen to conceal a continuing jockeying for power among individuals and clans. Siad holds the upper hand, but the issues and personalities involved, and the line-up of opponents are not at all clear. The Somali Government, however inefficient in other matters, is quite good at maintaining security, and in keeping the quarrels of the SRC in camera.</p>
                        <p>31. The current state of confusion in the SRC makes it difficult to offer any very clear long-range projections on political affairs in Somalia. If Siad emerges as the pre-eminent national leader, there will be a smoldering resentment among the losers, which will flare up eventually. SIAD does not seem to have acquired any substantial national popularity or any political power base, aside from his connections in the army. His rule is therefore likely to be challenged. If Siad is ousted from the presidency or forced to work within a council which he does not dominate, the Somali Government would probably be quarrelsome, inefficient, and unstable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>32. In 1963, when a poverty-stricken Somali Government was embroiled with Ethiopia in clashes in the Ogaden, Somalia appealed to all of the world powers for arms. Only the Soviets made an offer acceptable to the Somalis, providing a military credit of some $35 million and sending a few instructors and advisors. Since then, and particularly since the overthrow of civilian government in 1969, the Soviet presence in Somalia has grown considerably. It is hardly surprising that the military government in Somalia has taken a stance more pro-Soviet than its civilian predecessors. In part it is a reaction against the pro-Westernattitude of the previous civilian regime in Somalia. The military rulers claim that the US and other Western states had benefited unduly from their close relations with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Egal</persName> and his civilian officials. Also, US military aid to the arch-enemy, Ethiopia, and the continued Russian military assistance to Somalia weigh heavily on the attitudes of SIAD and the SRC.</p>
                        <p>33. Military aid is the main basis for Soviet influence, although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has extended somewhat more in economic aid ($87 million) than in military ($50 million). Soviet military advisors and instructors in Somalia number at least 300 and perhaps as many as 600. The military aid relationship has given the Soviet navy access to Somali port and shore facilities, and Soviet military aircraft use Somali air-fields. Since the beginning of 1969, more than a quarter of the Soviet navyʼs port calls in the Indian Ocean have been to Somali ports: more than three times as many as to any other Indian Ocean country.3 There is evidence that Soviet naval ships may already be using some of the ship service facilities which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> finished building in 1968 in the port of Berbera. In recent months Soviet influence in the Somali security services has increased. A high KGB official has visited Mogadiscio, and subsequently the Somali chief of security services (a relative of President SIAD) paid a more extended visit to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>3 In this period Soviet naval combatant ships made 45 port calls to Somalia out of a total of 171 calls in the entire Indian Ocean area.</p>
                        <p>34. From the Soviet point of view, Somalia is hardly a sterling example of a progressive or socialist state, but to be thrown out now would be particularly damaging to Soviet prestige. In fact, there is some evidence that SIAD a few months ago was seriously considering either diluting the Soviet presence, or turning to China as a principal backer. He seems to have shifted back to a close association with <pb n="13" xml:id="d332-13" facs="d332-13"/>the Russians, perhaps because he feels the need for powerful foreign backing at a time of do-. mestic troubles. It is difficult to assess the state of Somali attitudes towards the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, because Somali opinions of the Russians vary considerably. There have been, and still are, tensions in daily relations. Some of the SRC would like to chuck the Russians out, and a good many civilians share this view. SIAD has apparently succeeded in purging some 80 discontented high- and medium-ranking officers of the army and police, and has shipped them off for lengthy tours of “training” in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, a kind of enforced exile. Other Somalis, apparently with SIADʼs favor and support, have been sent for study in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>35. Despite these evidences of a close working relationship between Siad and the Soviets, Moscow is probably well aware of the fragility of the Somali regime, and will try to maintain enough flexibility to avoid another humiliating ouster as in Ghana or Sudan. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. will continue to provide military aid, but is unlikely to furnish much, if any, of the sophisticated equipment the Somalis would like to have. It would not seem to be in the Soviet interest to furnish enough equipment for the Somalis to stir up serious trouble with neigh-boring countries. Moreover, the Somali military is not yet well enough trained to use effectively the tanks, artillery, and planes already provided.</p>
                        <p>36. From the foregoing it is pretty clear that the Russian position in Somalia is essentially a shaky one. Any foreign presence in Somalia in this era of rising national sensitivity would be insecure. Yet, the Soviets undoubtedly hope to gain some advantages there, probably in the form of greater use of Somali facilities for military purposes. In spite of in-creased Soviet interest in further access to such facilities, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not appear to have base rights in the traditional sense of the word. SIAD would be unlikely to grant such rights, knowing that this would be highly unpopular in Somalia.</p>

                        <p>A. The French Territory of the Afars and Issas (TFAI)</p>
                        <p>37. This small territory contains the port of Djibouti, terminus of the only railroad from Addis Ababa to the sea. The Ethiopians find the present arrangement of French rule satisfactory, but would fight to prevent the Somalis from gaining possession of Djibouti. The government in Mogadiscio expects that sooner or later this territory will either become independent, or that Somalia will annex it. The Somali Army would fight the Ethiopians to prevent control by Addis Ababa. Because these attitudes are appreciated by the French, they have held onto this territory, long after leaving all other former colonies on the African continent. At African gatherings, the issue of French control over TFAI is frequently raised, but most Africans are sufficiently aware of the delicacy of the situation not to press very hard.</p>
                        <p>38. The French for years have said that they have no intention of leaving, and this is probably still true. They manipulate the local political elections in a fashion to maintain a balance between the pro-Ethiopian Afars, and the local Somali clan, the Issas. If the French were to lose control of the situation, as nearly happened in 1966, they might opt for an early departure, despite the predictable consequences of a serious clash between Ethiopia and Somalia. Somalia has the capability to create some trouble in TFAI, but has not felt able or willing to bear the risks of a full-scale military encounter with Ethiopia. In a contest with Somalia over the TFAI, the Ethiopians would probably have the military ad-vantage.</p>

                        <p>39. The Northeast Province of Kenya, a semidesert, is inhabited mainly by nomadic Somalis, who carried on a low-level guerrilla war against the Kenya Government in the mid-1960s. After this petered out, the Kenyans made some efforts to bring their Somali citizens more closely into national society. Some road-building and well-drilling projects, and programs to settle the nomads, have been partially successful. The province is generally peaceful, and the Somalis are represented in the Kenyan Parliament, but the Kenyan Somalis have not developed a sense of allegiance to Nairobi. To the extent that their political views are known, they lean towards eventual incorporation into Somalia.</p>
                        <p>40. The Kenyans are worried about a revival of Somali irredentism as an active movement. President SIAD in June stopped off on his return from the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> meeting hoping to discuss with President <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kenyatta</persName> the prospects for cession of Somali-inhabited Kenyan territory. The matter was not discussed, because Kenyatta did not care to go into it. Kenya, like Ethiopia and most other African states, is a firm backer of the proposition that boundaries, however irrational, are sacrosanct. Officials in Nairobi are aware of the training by North Korea of Somali guerrillas, and are, therefore, giving renewed thought to defense of the Northeast Province. The Kenyan army and police are small forces, with modest armament and poor logistic capabilities. They could probably turn back any attempted Somalia invasion, however, and Kenya has the added ad-vantage of a defense treaty with Ethiopia. If the death of the aged Kenyatta were to bring on a confused political situation in Kenya, the Somalis in Kenya or the Government of Somalia would be tempted to take advantage of it, to enlarge the Somali state.</p>

The reconciliation now underway in Sudan between northerners and southerners, and the development of friendly relations between Sudan and Ethiopia are among the more encouraging events in this area of the world. For long the real and imagined sup-port of Ethiopia for the southern Sudanese rebels had estranged relations between Khartoum and Addis Ababa. Sudanese support for the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> in past years served to reinforce mutual suspicions. There is a long history of antagonisms between Sudan and Ethiopia, revolving around religious ʼ and cultural differences. The current atmosphere of friend-ship depends largely upon the good relations between President Nimeiri and <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>, made possible by Nimeiriʼs reversal of policy towards the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and towards the rebellion in the south. Some government officials, as well as important political factions in both countries, are still highly suspicious of each other and quite ill at ease with the detente, despite its obvious advantages for both countries. The detente, in its present state, may not outlive either of its prime advocates. Since the Emperor is old, and Sudanese politics are normally turbulent, the prospects for continued good relations between Sudan and Ethiopia are only fair. Yet, even an abrupt end of the detente would not necessarily bring hostilities.</p>

More than in most other areas of Africa, the Horn is a stage for activity by the great powers. The US has long held a position of influence in Ethiopia; the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has recently built up its influence in Somalia; and the Chinese have <pb n="15" xml:id="d332-15" facs="d332-15"/>renewed offers of economic aid for all countries in the area. Italy remains an important source of aid to Somalia, although neither this nor the presence of a large number of Italians in Somalia has given Italy any significant degree of influence there. On still another level of involvement, the Arabs and Israelis are participants in the disputes and contributors to the tension of the Horn. For some years, I-Iaile Selassie has been concerned over the apparent alliance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, radical Arabs and Somalis to dominate the Red Sea area. Hence, the Emperor has sought closer relations with Israel and the US.</p>

                        <p>45. We do not know how their recent expulsion from Egypt has affected the Sovietsʼ view of their role in the Horn of Africa. How-ever, Somalia has for some time been the focal point of their activity in the area, and this suggests, in any event, that Moscow has long seen some strategic and political opportunities there.4 Somalia has been far the most receptive country in the Horn to Soviet initiatives. In large part, of course, Somaliaʼs importance to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is a function of its location on the Indian Ocean littoral, and of broad Soviet interests in this general area. As Soviet interest and involvement in the region have developed, Somaliaʼs importance has in-creased somewhat because of its potential to provide deep water and shore facilities for Soviet naval vessels. This potential would be further enhanced if the Suez Canal were to be reopened and the Red Sea were again to become an important international trade route.</p>
                        <p>4 See <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-10-71, “The Uses of Soviet Military Power in Distant Areas”, dated 15 December 1971.</p>
                        <p>46. The close relationship with Somalia has not cost the Russians much in Ethiopia. Ethiopians do not like the Soviet military aid to Somalia, and are fearful of its eventual effects. But <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> values his non-aligned image enough to keep correct relations with Moscow, makes occasional trips to Russia, and hopes for a more forthcoming Soviet economic <pb n="16" xml:id="d332-16" facs="d332-16"/>aid program. Only a small part of the Soviet credit of $100 million extended to Ethiopia in 1959 has been utilized. A long-standing Soviet aim in Ethiopia has been to get the Americans out of Kagnew, and some Soviet officials have suggested to Ethiopians that if this were done, Moscow would provide a generous military aid package. The Ethiopians are unlikely to be responsive to such an offer.</p>
                        <p>47. In the early 1960s the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, newly on the scene, had offered sizable sums in economic aid to the states of the Horn. After the mid-1960s, however, both Soviet and African interest in such programs fell off. The Soviets still are not very keen on greater involvement, but their interest has revived at least enough to maintain a competitive position with other powers. The general Soviet attitude is cautious, perhaps because earlier Soviet projects were not entirely successful. The petroleum refinery in Assab, Ethiopia, is obsolete and inefficient. Soviet economic aid programs in Somalia in the 1960s were hastily improvised and economically unsound-an overly large meat-packing plant, and a fish-processing plant in a country where the fish catch is very small.</p>
                        <p>48. In Sudan, the Soviets have been fulfilling their economic commitments despite their total loss of political influence. In Ethiopia, they are studying the feasibility of a new re-finery and are beginning some minor aid projects. In Somalia, after a good deal of foot-dragging, the Soviets have extended some $23 million in new economic aid, including a long-discussed dam, power, and irrigation complex. This limited activity appears to be a response to Chinese initiatives, and is directed towards minimizing Chinese political influence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">C. China</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>49. The Chinese are still an unknown quantity to the Africans. During the years of the Cultural Revolution, Chinese and Africans had few contacts, and most moderate Africans retained a residual fear derived from intemperate statements of Chinese leaders about sponsoring revolution in Africa and from Chinese activities in support of guerrilla movements. These fears have either greatly diminished or ʼdisappeared altogether, as the PRC during the past couple of years has placed greater emphasis on cultivating political and economic ties with black African governments and has virtually ceased to support subversion against them. <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> went to Peking in 1971 and subsequently established diplomatic relations, because of Chinese promises to cease aid to the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, and because of his interest in enhancing his position as a Third World leader.</p>
                        <p>50. As evidence of their new, more reason-able policies, the Chinese have been generous in granting aid to African states. Since early 1970 Peking has extended about $275 million of economic aid to Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The implementing of these aid commitments has been fairly slow in the eyes of some recipients, but the problem is mainly the difficulty in finding feasible projects, rather than deliberate foot-dragging on the part of the Chinese. The political accompaniment of the aid has been a very low-key appeal to Africans to join with China to resist the encroachments of the great powers. (China rep-resents itself as another struggling Third World country, recovering from the ravages of imperialism.) So far this policy has brought China some benefits, mainly in terms of good-will and a greater receptivity to Chinese international positions on major issues.</p>
                        <p>51. Chinese policy in the Horn, as elsewhere in black Africa, is essentially opportunistic. Carefully selected economic aid projects, and increasing ( though still small) Chinese purchases of the Hornʼs major export commodities--e.g., Ethiopian coffee and Su <pb n="17" xml:id="d332-17" facs="d332-17"/>danese cotton-suggest a growing Chinese awareness of the interests of countries in the area of the Horn. But even if China continues to show this sort of interest and is willing to continue spending money there, it will face the traditional resistance of the countries of the Horn to foreign influence.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>52. Generally speaking, the situation in the Horn of Africa is more favorable now in terms of US interests than has been the case for some years. The willingness of Sudan and Yemen to resume diplomatic relations with the US suggests a lessening of the tensions which persisted for so long after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 and which affected US relations in the area of the Horn. The disarray of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss> and an improvement in the general security situation in Ethiopia can also be counted as favorable factors. Even in Somalia, where US influence has been close to zero for years, the regime has in recent weeks hinted at the possibility of improvements in relations, but the US relationship with Ethiopia is likely to continue to be an impediment to good relations with Somalia.</p>
                        <p>53. But there is an ephemeral quality to much of this. Governments and their policies in this area are generally highly dependent upon individuals at the top. The removal of any of these could abruptly change the atmosphere. The greatest uncertainty is the aftermath of the Emperorʼs death. The chances are that a successor government would continue to look to the US as its primary backer, particularly if the succession comes while the Soviets are still conspicuously involved in Somalia. If a successor regime in Ethiopia faces some difficulty from internal or external challenges, as is likely, it would look primarily to the US for additional emergency support, and would probably base its subsequent relations with the US on the degree and speed of the US response.</p>
                        <p>54. The US lease on Kagnew Station runs through 1978. There is still no significant public opposition to the installation. Many Ethiopians accept it as a communications and scientific research establishment rather than a military base. Its contribution to the local economy also is a factor in its acceptance. A few Ethiopian students, intellectuals, and nationalists want the US to leave, but many Ethiopians-particularly among the governing class-are more concerned to have the US maintain its presence, despite propaganda at-tacks from <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>, radical Arab, and Communist media. There is some danger, however, that an individual or dissident faction of the <gloss target="#t_ELF1">ELF</gloss>-or even a Palestinian group-might take some hostile action against Kagnew. The reduction of US personnel by about a third in the spring of 1972 had no significant impact on US relations with Ethiopia or on local acceptance of Kagnew. Currently US personnel number about 2,200, including dependents. We judge that the Ethiopian Government, which understands that Kagnew is a quid pro quo for continued US military aid, is likely to permit Kagnew to continue functioning through the period of its lease.</p>
                        <p>55. There are reasons other than Kagnew for continued US interest in maintaining friendly relations with Ethiopia. Though there are few US investments in Ethiopia, military access to Ethiopian airfields and ports is likely to continue to be of interest to the US. There is no other state in the area so willing to associate itself forthrightly with the US. Ethiopia, even without <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>, is likely to be an important and influential African state, although the new regime will have to establish its own credentials.</p>

                        <p>This paper assesses the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>ʼs position in Somalia, Soviet interests and objectives in the Horn of Africa, and prospects for Somali-Soviet relations.</p>
                        <p>ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union has greatly expanded its presence in Somalia, particularly since the Somali armyʼs takeover of the government in 1969. Territorial disputes between Somalia and its neighbors and Western reluctance to furnish arms to Mogadiscio provided an opportunity for the Soviets, beginning in 1963, to become virtually the sole source of military aid to Somalia. This in turn has proved an effective instrument for the diffusion of Soviet influence. By providing such assistance, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also became, by implication at least, a supporter of Somali national aspirations and irredentism.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has strategic interests in Somalia associated with, but peripheral to, its larger interests in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean. Lesser or supporting interests appear to be to secure a foothold in East Africa and to pre-empt Western and Chinese positions in the Horn. How the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> hopes to exploit its currently favorable position in Somalia depends on presently uncertain factors, such as the Middle East situation.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d333-02" facs="d333-02"/>
                        <p>For the time being, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seems satisfied with access to Somali air and port facilities while retaining an influential presence from which to exploit future opportunities. The Soviets currently appear to be working to maintain and possibly cautiously expand their influence with a minimum of additional commitments. They seem to be increasingly concerned about Chinese competition as a result of the large Chinese aid agreement with Somalia in 1971 and indications (of which the Soviets are presumably aware) that the Somalis may have approached the PRC as an alternative source of arms aid.</p>
                        <p>The Somali leadership shows no inclination at present to follow the Sudanese and Egyptian examples in ousting the Soviets, although the military regime often feels an affinity with the governments of Sudan and, to a lesser extent, Egypt. The Somalis count on the military assistance they get from the Soviets to reinforce their unsettled, irredentist claims against Ethiopia and Kenya. Furthermore, President Mohammad Siad Barre, who is trying to consolidate his position in the ruling Somali Revolutionary Council (SRC), may not feel powerful enough to risk Soviet displeasure by tampering with the Somali-Soviet relationship. He seems to have found the increased Soviet involvement in the Somali security service useful in his efforts to strengthen his position. There is no evidence that the current rivalries in the SRC center on the Somali-Soviet relationship. But the potential for Soviet involvement in Somali politics, intentional or otherwise, is high as a result of the dominant Soviet position in the army and internal security apparatus.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d333-03" facs="d333-03"/>
                        <p>Moscowʼs position in Somalia appears secure, at least for the near future. But a significant expansion of its presence or influence seems unlikely, given both the apparent Soviet wish to avoid a client-state relationship and the nationalistic nature of the Somali leadership.</p>
